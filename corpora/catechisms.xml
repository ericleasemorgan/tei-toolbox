I. The life of man - to know and love God 

1 God, infinitely perfect and blessed in himself, in a plan of sheer 
goodness freely created man to make him share in his own blessed life. 
For this reason, at every time and in every place, God draws close to 
man. He calls man to seek him, to know him, to love him with all his 
strength. He calls together all men, scattered and divided by sin, into 
the unity of his family, the Church. To accomplish this, when the 
fullness of time had come, God sent his Son as Redeemer and Saviour. 



In his Son and through him, he invites men to become, in the Holy 
Spirit, his adopted children and thus heirs of his blessed life. 

2 So that this call should resound throughout the world, Christ sent 
forth the apostles he had chosen, commissioning them to proclaim the 
gospel: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them 
in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 
teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am 
with you always, to the close of the age."4 Strengthened by this 
mission, the apostles "went forth and preached everywhere, while the 
Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that 
attended it."5 

3 Those who with God's help have welcomed Christ's call and freely 
responded to it are urged on by love of Christ to proclaim the Good 
News everywhere in the world. This treasure, received from the 
apostles, has been faithfully guarded by their successors. All Christ's 
faithful are called to hand it on from generation to generation, by 
professing the faith, by living it in fraternal sharing, and by celebrating 
it in liturgy and prayer.6

PROLOGUE 

 

 

II. Handing on the Faith: Catechesis 



4 Quite early on, the name catechesis was given to the totality of the 
Church's efforts to make disciples, to help men believe that Jesus is the 
Son of God so that believing they might have life in his name, and to 
educate and instruct them in this life, thus building up the body of 
Christ.7 

5 "Catechesis is an education in the faith of children, young people and 
adults which includes especially the teaching of Christian doctrine 
imparted, generally speaking, in an organic and systematic way, with a 
view to initiating the hearers into the fullness of Christian life."8 

6 While not being formally identified with them, catechesis is built on a 
certain number of elements of the Church's pastoral mission which 
have a catechetical aspect, that prepare for catechesis, or spring from it. 
They are: the initial proclamation of the Gospel or missionary 
preaching to arouse faith; examination of the reasons for belief; 
experience of Christian living; celebration of the sacraments; 
integration into the ecclesial community; and apostolic and missionary 
witness.9 

7 "Catechesis is intimately bound up with the whole of the Church's 
life. Not only her geographical extension and numerical increase, but 
even more her inner growth and correspondence with God's plan 
depend essentially on catechesis."10 

8 Periods of renewal in the Church are also intense moments of 
catechesis. In the great era of the Fathers of the Church, saintly 
bishops devoted an important part of their ministry to catechesis. St. 
Cyril of Jerusalem and St. John Chrysostom, St. Ambrose and St. 
Augustine, and many other Fathers wrote catechetical works that 
remain models for us.11 

9 "The ministry of catechesis draws ever fresh energy from the 
councils. the Council of Trent is a noteworthy example of this. It gave 
catechesis priority in its constitutions and decrees. It lies at the origin 
of the Roman Catechism, which is also known by the name of that 
council and which is a work of the first rank as a summary of Christian 
teaching. . "12 The Council of Trent initiated a remarkable 
organization of the Church's catechesis. Thanks to the work of holy 
bishops and theologians such as St. Peter Canisius, St. Charles 



Borromeo, St. Turibius of Mongrovejo or St. Robert Bellarmine, it 
occasioned the publication of numerous catechisms. 

10 It is therefore no surprise that catechesis in the Church has again 
attracted attention in the wake of the Second Vatican Council, which 
Pope Paul Vl considered the great catechism of modern times. the 
General Catechetical Directory (1971) the sessions of the Synod of 
Bishops devoted to evangelization (1974) and catechesis (1977), the 
apostolic exhortations Evangelii nuntiandi (1975) and Catechesi 
tradendae (1979), attest to this. the Extraordinary Synod of Bishops in 
1985 asked "that a catechism or compendium of all Catholic doctrine 
regarding both faith and morals be composed"13 The Holy Father, 
Pope John Paul II, made the Synod's wish his own, acknowledging that 
"this desire wholly corresponds to a real need of the universal Church 
and of the particular Churches."14 He set in motion everything 
needed to carry out the Synod Fathers' wish.

III. The Aim and Intended Readership of the Catechism 

11 This catechism aims at presenting an organic synthesis of the 
essential and fundamental contents of Catholic doctrine, as regards 
both faith and morals, in the light of the Second Vatican Council and 
the whole of the Church's Tradition. Its principal sources are the 
Sacred Scriptures, the Fathers of the Church, the liturgy, and the 
Church's Magisterium. It is intended to serve "as a point of reference 
for the catechisms or compendia that are composed in the various 
countries".15 

12 This work is intended primarily for those responsible for catechesis: 
first of all the bishops, as teachers of the faith and pastors of the 
Church. It is offered to them as an instrument in fulfilling their 
responsibility of teaching the People of God. Through the bishops, it is 
addressed to redactors of catechisms, to priests, and to catechists. It 
will also be useful reading for all other Christian faithful.

IV. Structure of this Catechism 

13 The plan of this catechism is inspired by the great tradition of 
catechisms which build catechesis on four pillars: the baptismal 
profession of faith (the Creed), the sacraments of faith, the life of faith 
(the Commandments), and the prayer of the believer (the Lord's 
Prayer). 

Part One: the Profession of Faith 

14 Those who belong to Christ through faith and Baptism must 
confess their baptismal faith before men.16 First therefore the 
Catechism expounds revelation, by which God addresses and gives 
himself to man, and the faith by which man responds to God (Section 
One). the profession of faith summarizes the gifts that God gives man: 
as the Author of all that is good; as Redeemer; and as Sanctifier. It 
develops these in the three chapters on our baptismal faith in the one 
God: the almighty Father, the Creator; his Son Jesus Christ, our Lord 
and Saviour; and the Holy Spirit, the Sanctifier, in the Holy Church 
(Section Two). 

Part Two: the Sacraments of Faith 

15 The second part of the Catechism explains how God's salvation, 
accomplished once for all through Christ Jesus and the Holy Spirit, is 
made present in the sacred actions of the Church's liturgy (Section 
One), especially in the seven sacraments (Section Two). 

Part Three: the Life of Faith 

16 The third part of the Catechism deals with the final end of man 
created in the image of God: beatitude, and the ways of reaching it - 
through right conduct freely chosen, with the help of God's law and 
grace (Section One), and through conduct that fulfils the twofold 
commandment of charity, specified in God's Ten Commandments 
(Section Two). 

Part Four: Prayer in the Life of Faith 



17 The last part of the Catechism deals with the meaning and 
importance of prayer in the life of believers (Section One). It concludes 
with a brief commentary on the seven petitions of the Lord's Prayer 
(Section Two), for indeed we find in these the sum of all the good 
things which we must hope for, and which our heavenly Father wants 
to grant us.

PROLOGUE 

 

 

V. Practical Directions for Using this Catechism 

18 This catechism is conceived as an organic presentation of the 
Catholic faith in its entirety. It should be seen therefore as a unified 
whole. Numerous cross-references in the margin of the text (numbers 
found at the end of a sentence referring to other paragraphs that deal 
with the same theme), as well as the analytical index at the end of the 
volume, allow the reader to view each theme in its relationship with the 
entirety of the faith. 

19 The texts of Sacred Scripture are often not quoted word for word 
but are merely indicated by a reference (cf.). For a deeper 
understanding of such passages, the reader should refer to the 
Scriptural texts themselves. Such Biblical references are a valuable 
working-tool in catechesis. 



20 The use of small print in certain passages indicates observations of 
an historical or apologetic nature, or supplementary doctrinal 
explanations. 

21 The quotations, also in small print, from patristic, liturgical, 
magisterial or hagiographical sources, are intended to enrich the 
doctrinal presentations. These texts have often been chosen with a view 
to direct catechetical use. 

22 At the end of each thematic unit, a series of brief texts in small 
italics sums up the essentials of that unit's teaching in condensed 
formulae. These "IN BRIEF" summaries may suggest to local 
catechists brief summary formulae that could be memorized. 

 

 

PROLOGUE 

 

 

VI. Necessary Adaptations 

23 The Catechism emphasizes the exposition of doctrine. It seeks to 
help deepen understanding of faith. In this way it is oriented towards 
the maturing of that faith, its putting down roots in personal life, and 
its shining forth in personal conduct.17 

24 By design, this Catechism does not set out to provide the 
adaptation of doctrinal presentations and catechetical methods 
required by the differences of culture, age, spiritual maturity, and social 
and ecclesial condition among all those to whom it is addressed. Such 
indispensable adaptations are the responsibility of particular 
catechisms and, even more, of those who instruct the faithful: 

Whoever teaches must become "all things to all men" (I Cor 9:22), to 
win everyone to Christ. . . Above all, teachers must not imagine that a 
single kind of soul has been entrusted to them, and that consequently 
it is lawful to teach and form equally all the faithful in true piety with 
one and the same method! Let them realize that some are in Christ as 
newborn babes, others as adolescents, and still others as adults in full 



command of their powers.... Those who are called to the ministry of 
preaching must suit their words to the maturity and understanding of 
their hearers, as they hand on the teaching of the mysteries of faith and 
the rules of moral conduct.18 

Above all - Charity 

25 To conclude this Prologue, it is fitting to recall this pastoral 
principle stated by the Roman Catechism: 

The whole concern of doctrine and its teaching must be directed to the 
love that never ends. Whether something is proposed for belief, for 
hope or for action, the love of our Lord must always be made 
accessible, so that anyone can see that all the works of perfect Christian 
virtue spring from love and have no other objective than to arrive at 
love.19

PART ONE: THE PROFESSION OF FAITH 

 

SECTION ONE "I BELIEVE" - "WE BELIEVE" 

26 We begin our profession of faith by saying: "I believe" or "We 
believe". Before expounding the Church's faith, as confessed in the 
Creed, celebrated in the liturgy and lived in observance of God's 
commandments and in prayer, we must first ask what "to believe" 
means. Faith is man's response to God, who reveals himself and gives 
himself to man, at the same time bringing man a superabundant light 
as he searches for the ultimate meaning of his life. Thus we shall 
consider first that search (Chapter One), then the divine Revelation by 
which God comes to meet man (Chapter Two), and finally the 
response of faith (Chapter Three). 

 

 

PART ONE: THE PROFESSION OF FAITH 

 

SECTION ONE "I BELIEVE" - "WE BELIEVE" 

 

CHAPTER ONE MAN'S CAPACITY FOR GOD 

 

I. The Desire for God 

27 The desire for God is written in the human heart, because man is 
created by God and for God; and God never ceases to draw man to 
himself. Only in God will he find the truth and happiness he never 
stops searching for: 

The dignity of man rests above all on the fact that he is called to 
communion with God. This invitation to converse with God is 
addressed to man as soon as he comes into being. For if man exists it is 
because God has created him through love, and through love continues 



to hold him in existence. He cannot live fully according to truth unless 
he freely acknowledges that love and entrusts himself to his creator.1 

28 In many ways, throughout history down to the present day, men 
have given expression to their quest for God in their religious beliefs 
and behaviour: in their prayers, sacrifices, rituals, meditations, and so 
forth. These forms of religious expression, despite the ambiguities they 
often bring with them, are so universal that one may well call man a 
religious being: 

From one ancestor (God) made all nations to inhabit the whole earth, 
and he allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of the 
places where they would live, so that they would search for God and 
perhaps grope for him and find him - though indeed he is not far from 
each one of us. For "in him we live and move and have our being."2 

29 But this "intimate and vital bond of man to God" (GS 19 # 1) can 
be forgotten, overlooked, or even explicitly rejected by man.3 Such 
attitudes can have different causes: revolt against evil in the world; 
religious ignorance or indifference; the cares and riches of this world; 
the scandal of bad example on the part of believers; currents of 
thought hostile to religion; finally, that attitude of sinful man which 
makes him hide from God out of fear and flee his call.4 

30 "Let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice."5 Although 
man can forget God or reject him, He never ceases to call every man to 
seek him, so as to find life and happiness. But this search for God 
demands of man every effort of intellect, a sound will, "an upright 
heart", as well as the witness of others who teach him to seek God. 

You are great, O Lord, and greatly to be praised: great is your power 
and your wisdom is without measure. and man, so small a part of your 
creation, wants to praise you: this man, though clothed with mortality 
and bearing the evidence of sin and the proof that you withstand the 
proud. Despite everything, man, though but a small a part of your 
creation, wants to praise you. You yourself encourage him to delight in 
your praise, for you have made us for yourself, and our heart is restless 
until it rests in you.6

II. Ways of Coming to Know God 

31 Created in God's image and called to know and love him, the 
person who seeks God discovers certain ways of coming to know him. 
These are also called proofs for the existence of God, not in the sense 
of proofs in the natural sciences, but rather in the sense of "converging 



and convincing arguments", which allow us to attain certainty about 
the truth. These "ways" of approaching God from creation have a 
twofold point of departure: the physical world, and the human person. 

32 The world: starting from movement, becoming, contingency, and 
the world's order and beauty, one can come to a knowledge of God as 
the origin and the end of the universe. 

As St. Paul says of the Gentiles: For what can be known about God is 
plain to them, because God has shown it to them. Ever since the 
creation of the world his invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and 
deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made.7 

  

And St. Augustine issues this challenge: Question the beauty of the 
earth, question the beauty of the sea, question the beauty of the air 
distending and diffusing itself, question the beauty of the sky. . . 
question all these realities. All respond: "See, we are beautiful." Their 
beauty is a profession [confessio]. These beauties are subject to change. 
Who made them if not the Beautiful One [Pulcher] who is not subject 
to change?8 

33 The human person: with his openness to truth and beauty, his sense 
of moral goodness, his freedom and the voice of his conscience, with 
his longings for the infinite and for happiness, man questions himself 
about God's existence. In all this he discerns signs of his spiritual soul. 
the soul, the "seed of eternity we bear in ourselves, irreducible to the 
merely material",9 can have its origin only in God. 

34 The world, and man, attest that they contain within themselves 
neither their first principle nor their final end, but rather that they 
participate in Being itself, which alone is without origin or end. Thus, 
in different ways, man can come to know that there exists a reality 
which is the first cause and final end of all things, a reality "that 
everyone calls God".10 

35 Man's faculties make him capable of coming to a knowledge of the 
existence of a personal God. But for man to be able to enter into real 
intimacy with him, God willed both to reveal himself to man, and to 
give him the grace of being able to welcome this revelation in faith.(so) 



the proofs of God's existence, however, can predispose one to faith and 
help one to see that faith is not opposed to reason.

III. The Knowledge of God According to the Church 

36 "Our holy mother, the Church, holds and teaches that God, the first 
principle and last end of all things, can be known with certainty from 
the created world by the natural light of human reason."11 Without 
this capacity, man would not be able to welcome God's revelation. 
Man has this capacity because he is created "in the image of God".12 

37 In the historical conditions in which he finds himself, however, man 
experiences many difficulties in coming to know God by the light of 
reason alone: 



Though human reason is, strictly speaking, truly capable by its own 
natural power and light of attaining to a true and certain knowledge of 
the one personal God, who watches over and controls the world by his 
providence, and of the natural law written in our hearts by the Creator; 
yet there are many obstacles which prevent reason from the effective 
and fruitful use of this inborn faculty. For the truths that concern the 
relations between God and man wholly transcend the visible order of 
things, and, if they are translated into human action and influence it, 
they call for self-surrender and abnegation. the human mind, in its 
turn, is hampered in the attaining of such truths, not only by the 
impact of the senses and the imagination, but also by disordered 
appetites which are the consequences of original sin. So it happens that 
men in such matters easily persuade themselves that what they would 
not like to be true is false or at least doubtful.13 

38 This is why man stands in need of being enlightened by God's 
revelation, not only about those things that exceed his understanding, 
but also "about those religious and moral truths which of themselves 
are not beyond the grasp of human reason, so that even in the present 
condition of the human race, they can be known by all men with ease, 
with firm certainty and with no admixture of error".14

IV. How Can We Speak about God? 



39 In defending the ability of human reason to know God, the Church 
is expressing her confidence in the possibility of speaking about him to 
all men and with all men, and therefore of dialogue with other 
religions, with philosophy and science, as well as with unbelievers and 
atheists. 

40 Since our knowledge of God is limited, our language about him is 
equally so. We can name God only by taking creatures as our starting 
point, and in accordance with our limited human ways of knowing and 
thinking. 

41 All creatures bear a certain resemblance to God, most especially 
man, created in the image and likeness of God. the manifold 
perfections of creatures - their truth, their goodness, their beauty all 
reflect the infinite perfection of God. Consequently we can name God 
by taking his creatures" perfections as our starting point, "for from the 
greatness and beauty of created things comes a corresponding 
perception of their Creator".15 

42 God transcends all creatures. We must therefore continually purify 
our language of everything in it that is limited, imagebound or 
imperfect, if we are not to confuse our image of God --"the 
inexpressible, the incomprehensible, the invisible, the ungraspable"-- 
with our human representations.16 Our human words always fall short 
of the mystery of God. 

43 Admittedly, in speaking about God like this, our language is using 
human modes of expression; nevertheless it really does attain to God 
himself, though unable to express him in his infinite simplicity. 
Likewise, we must recall that "between Creator and creature no 
similitude can be expressed without implying an even greater 
dissimilitude";17 and that "concerning God, we cannot grasp what he 
is, but only what he is not, and how other beings stand in relation to 
him."18

CHAPTER ONE MAN'S CAPACITY FOR GOD 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

44 Man is by nature and vocation a religious being. Coming from God, 
going toward God, man lives a fully human life only if he freely lives by 
his bond with God. 

45 Man is made to live in communion with God in whom he finds 
happiness: When I am completely united to you, there will be no more 
sorrow or trials; entirely full of you, my life will be complete (St. 
Augustine, Conf. 10, 28, 39: PL 32, 795}. 

46 When he listens to the message of creation and to the voice of 
conscience, man can arrive at certainty about the existence of God, the 
cause and the end of everything. 

47 The Church teaches that the one true God, our Creator and Lord, 
can be known with certainty from his works, by the natural light of 
human reason (cf. Vatican Council I, can. 2 # 1: DS 3026), 

48 We really can name God, starting from the manifold perfections of 
his creatures, which are likenesses of the infinitely perfect God, even if 
our limited language cannot exhaust the mystery. 

49 Without the Creator, the creature vanishes (GS 36). This is the 
reason why believers know that the love of Christ urges them to bring 
the light of the living God to those who do not know him or who reject 
him.

CHAPTER TWO GOD COMES TO MEET MAN 

50 By natural reason man can know God with certainty, on the basis of 
his works. But there is another order of knowledge, which man cannot 
possibly arrive at by his own powers: the order of divine Revelation.1 
Through an utterly free decision, God has revealed himself and given 
himself to man. This he does by revealing the mystery, his plan of 
loving goodness, formed from all eternity in Christ, for the benefit of 
all men. God has fully revealed this plan by sending us his beloved 
Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit.

Article 1 THE REVELATION OF GOD 

I. God Reveals His "Plan of Loving Goodness" 

51 "It pleased God, in his goodness and wisdom, to reveal himself and 
to make known the mystery of his will. His will was that men should 
have access to the Father, through Christ, the Word made flesh, in the 
Holy Spirit, and thus become sharers in the divine nature."2 

52 God, who "dwells in unapproachable light", wants to communicate 
his own divine life to the men he freely created, in order to adopt them 
as his sons in his only-begotten Son.3 By revealing himself God wishes 



to make them capable of responding to him, and of knowing him and 
of loving him far beyond their own natural capacity. 

53 The divine plan of Revelation is realized simultaneously "by deeds 
and words which are intrinsically bound up with each other"4 and 
shed light on each another. It involves a specific divine pedagogy: God 
communicates himself to man gradually. He prepares him to welcome 
by stages the supernatural Revelation that is to culminate in the person 
and mission of the incarnate Word, Jesus Christ. 

St. Irenaeus of Lyons repeatedly speaks of this divine pedagogy using 
the image of God and man becoming accustomed to one another: the 
Word of God dwelt in man and became the Son of man in order to 
accustom man to perceive God and to accustom God to dwell in man, 
according to the Father's pleasure.5

II. The Stages of Revelation 

In the beginning God makes himself known 

54 "God, who creates and conserves all things by his Word, provides 
men with constant evidence of himself in created realities. and 
furthermore, wishing to open up the way to heavenly salvation - he 
manifested himself to our first parents from the very beginning."6 He 



invited them to intimate communion with himself and clothed them 
with resplendent grace and justice. 

55 This revelation was not broken off by our first parents' sin. "After 
the fall, (God) buoyed them up with the hope of salvation, by 
promising redemption; and he has never ceased to show his solicitude 
for the human race. For he wishes to give eternal life to all those who 
seek salvation by patience in well-doing."7 

Even when he disobeyed you and lost your friendship you did not 
abandon him to the power of death. . . Again and again you offered a 
covenant to man.8 

The covenant with Noah 

56 After the unity of the human race was shattered by sin God at once 
sought to save humanity part by part. the covenant with Noah after the 
flood gives expression to the principle of the divine economy toward 
the "nations", in other words, towards men grouped "in their lands, 
each with (its) own language, by their families, in their nations".9 

57 This state of division into many nations is at once cosmic, social and 
religious. It is intended to limit the pride of fallen humanity10 united 
only in its perverse ambition to forge its own unity as at Babel.11 But, 
because of sin, both polytheism and the idolatry of the nation and of its 
rulers constantly threaten this provisional economy with the perversion 
of paganism.12 

58 The covenant with Noah remains in force during the times of the 
Gentiles, until the universal proclamation of the Gospel.13 The Bible 
venerates several great figures among the Gentiles: Abel the just, the 
king-priest Melchisedek - a figure of Christ - and the upright "Noah, 
Daniel, and Job".14 Scripture thus expresses the heights of sanctity 
that can be reached by those who live according to the covenant of 
Noah, waiting for Christ to "gather into one the children of God who 
are scattered abroad".15 

God chooses Abraham 

59 In order to gather together scattered humanity God calls Abram 
from his country, his kindred and his father's house,16 and makes him 



Abraham, that is, "the father of a multitude of nations". "In you all the 
nations of the earth shall be blessed."17 

60 The people descended from Abraham would be the trustee of the 
promise made to the patriarchs, the chosen people, called to prepare 
for that day when God would gather all his children into the unity of 
the Church.18 They would be the root on to which the Gentiles would 
be grafted, once they came to believe.19 

61 The patriarchs, prophets and certain other Old Testament figures 
have been and always will be honoured as saints in all the Church's 
liturgical traditions. 

God forms his people Israel 

62 After the patriarchs, God formed Israel as his people by freeing 
them from slavery in Egypt. He established with them the covenant of 
Mount Sinai and, through Moses, gave them his law so that they would 
recognize him and serve him as the one living and true God, the 
provident Father and just judge, and so that they would look for the 
promised Saviour.20 

63 Israel is the priestly people of God, "called by the name of the 
LORD", and "the first to hear the word of God",21 The people of 
"elder brethren" in the faith of Abraham. 

64 Through the prophets, God forms his people in the hope of 
salvation, in the expectation of a new and everlasting Covenant 
intended for all, to be written on their hearts.22 The prophets proclaim 
a radical redemption of the People of God, purification from all their 
infidelities, a salvation which will include all the nations.23 Above all, 
the poor and humble of the Lord will bear this hope. Such holy women 
as Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, Miriam, Deborah, Hannah, Judith and 
Esther kept alive the hope of Israel's salvation. the purest figure among 
them is Mary.24

III. Christ Jesus -- "Mediator and Fullness of All Revelation"25 

God has said everything in his Word 

65 "In many and various ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the 
prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son."26 
Christ, the Son of God made man, is the Father's one, perfect and 
unsurpassable Word. In him he has said everything; there will be no 
other word than this one. St. John of the Cross, among others, 
commented strikingly on Hebrews 1:1-2: 

In giving us his Son, his only Word (for he possesses no other), he 
spoke everything to us at once in this sole Word - and he has no more 
to say. . . because what he spoke before to the prophets in parts, he has 
now spoken all at once by giving us the All Who is His Son. Any person 
questioning God or desiring some vision or revelation would be guilty 
not only of foolish behaviour but also of offending him, by not fixing 
his eyes entirely upon Christ and by living with the desire for some 
other novelty.27 

There will be no further Revelation 

66 "The Christian economy, therefore, since it is the new and definitive 
Covenant, will never pass away; and no new public revelation is to be 
expected before the glorious manifestation of our Lord Jesus 
Christ."28 Yet even if Revelation is already complete, it has not been 



made completely explicit; it remains for Christian faith gradually to 
grasp its full significance over the course of the centuries. 

67 Throughout the ages, there have been so-called "private" 
revelations, some of which have been recognized by the authority of 
the Church. They do not belong, however, to the deposit of faith. It is 
not their role to improve or complete Christ's definitive Revelation, but 
to help live more fully by it in a certain period of history. Guided by 
the Magisterium of the Church, the sensus fidelium knows how to 
discern and welcome in these revelations whatever constitutes an 
authentic call of Christ or his saints to the Church. 

Christian faith cannot accept "revelations" that claim to surpass or 
correct the Revelation of which Christ is the fulfilment, as is the case in 
certain non Christian religions and also in certain recent sects which 
base themselves on such "revelations".

IN BRIEF 



68 By love, God has revealed himself and given himself to man. He has 
thus provided the definitive, superabundant answer to the questions 
that man asks himself about the meaning and purpose of his life. 

69 God has revealed himself to man by gradually communicating his 
own mystery in deeds and in words. 

70 Beyond the witness to himself that God gives in created things, he 
manifested himself to our first parents, spoke to them and, after the 
fall, promised them salvation (cf Gen 3:15) and offered them his 
covenant. 

71 God made an everlasting covenant with Noah and with all living 
beings (cf Gen 9:16). It will remain in force as long as the world lasts. 

72 God chose Abraham and made a covenant with him and his 
descendants. By the covenant God formed his people and revealed his 
law to them through Moses. Through the prophets, he prepared them 
to accept the salvation destined for all humanity. 

73 God has revealed himself fully by sending his own Son, in whom he 
has established his covenant for ever. the Son is his Father's definitive 
Word; so there will be no further Revelation after him.

I. The Apostolic Tradition 

75 "Christ the Lord, in whom the entire Revelation of the most high 
God is summed up, commanded the apostles to preach the Gospel, 
which had been promised beforehand by the prophets, and which he 
fulfilled in his own person and promulgated with his own lips. In 



preaching the Gospel, they were to communicate the gifts of God to all 
men. This Gospel was to be the source of all saving truth and moral 
discipline."32 

In the apostolic preaching. . . 

76 In keeping with the Lord's command, the Gospel was handed on in 
two ways:  

- orally "by the apostles who handed on, by the spoken word of their 
preaching, by the example they gave, by the institutions they 
established, what they themselves had received - whether from the lips 
of Christ, from his way of life and his works, or whether they had 
learned it at the prompting of the Holy Spirit";33  

- in writing "by those apostles and other men associated with the 
apostles who, under the inspiration of the same Holy Spirit, committed 
the message of salvation to writing".34 

. . . continued in apostolic succession 

77 "In order that the full and living Gospel might always be preserved 
in the Church the apostles left bishops as their successors. They gave 
them their own position of teaching authority."35 Indeed, "the 
apostolic preaching, which is expressed in a special way in the inspired 
books, was to be preserved in a continuous line of succession until the 
end of time."36 

78 This living transmission, accomplished in the Holy Spirit, is called 
Tradition, since it is distinct from Sacred Scripture, though closely 
connected to it. Through Tradition, "the Church, in her doctrine, life 
and worship, perpetuates and transmits to every generation all that she 
herself is, all that she believes."37 "The sayings of the holy Fathers are 
a witness to the life-giving presence of this Tradition, showing how its 
riches are poured out in the practice and life of the Church, in her 
belief and her prayer."38 

79 The Father's self-communication made through his Word in the 
Holy Spirit, remains present and active in the Church: "God, who 
spoke in the past, continues to converse with the Spouse of his beloved 
Son. and the Holy Spirit, through whom the living voice of the Gospel 
rings out in the Church - and through her in the world - leads believers 



to the full truth, and makes the Word of Christ dwell in them in all its 
richness."39

II. The Relationship Between Tradition and Sacred Scripture 

One common source. . . 

80 "Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture, then, are bound closely 
together, and communicate one with the other. For both of them, 
flowing out from the same divine well-spring, come together in some 
fashion to form one thing, and move towards the same goal."40 Each 
of them makes present and fruitful in the Church the mystery of 
Christ, who promised to remain with his own "always, to the close of 
the age".41 

. . . two distinct modes of transmission 

81 "Sacred Scripture is the speech of God as it is put down in writing 
under the breath of the Holy Spirit."42 

"and [Holy] Tradition transmits in its entirety the Word of God which 
has been entrusted to the apostles by Christ the Lord and the Holy 
Spirit. It transmits it to the successors of the apostles so that, 
enlightened by the Spirit of truth, they may faithfully preserve, 
expound and spread it abroad by their preaching."43 

82 As a result the Church, to whom the transmission and 
interpretation of Revelation is entrusted, "does not derive her certainty 
about all revealed truths from the holy Scriptures alone. Both 
Scripture and Tradition must be accepted and honoured with equal 
sentiments of devotion and reverence."44 

Apostolic Tradition and ecclesial traditions 

83 The Tradition here in question comes from the apostles and hands 
on what they received from Jesus' teaching and example and what they 
learned from the Holy Spirit. the first generation of Christians did not 
yet have a written New Testament, and the New Testament itself 
demonstrates the process of living Tradition. 

Tradition is to be distinguished from the various theological, 
disciplinary, liturgical or devotional traditions, born in the local 
churches over time. These are the particular forms, adapted to different 
places and times, in which the great Tradition is expressed. In the light 



of Tradition, these traditions can be retained, modified or even 
abandoned under the guidance of the Church's Magisterium.

III. The Interpretation of the Heritage of Faith 

The heritage of faith entrusted to the whole of the Church 

84 The apostles entrusted the "Sacred deposit" of the faith (the 
depositum fidei),45 contained in Sacred Scripture and Tradition, to 
the whole of the Church. "By adhering to [this heritage] the entire holy 
people, united to its pastors, remains always faithful to the teaching of 
the apostles, to the brotherhood, to the breaking of bread and the 
prayers. So, in maintaining, practising and professing the faith that has 
been handed on, there should be a remarkable harmony between the 
bishops and the faithful."46 

The Magisterium of the Church 



85 "The task of giving an authentic interpretation of the Word of God, 
whether in its written form or in the form of Tradition, has been 
entrusted to the living teaching office of the Church alone. Its 
authority in this matter is exercised in the name of Jesus Christ."47 
This means that the task of interpretation has been entrusted to the 
bishops in communion with the successor of Peter, the Bishop of 
Rome. 

86 "Yet this Magisterium is not superior to the Word of God, but is its 
servant. It teaches only what has been handed on to it. At the divine 
command and with the help of the Holy Spirit, it listens to this 
devotedly, guards it with dedication and expounds it faithfully. All that 
it proposes for belief as being divinely revealed is drawn from this 
single deposit of faith."48 

87 Mindful of Christ's words to his apostles: "He who hears you, hears 
me",49 The faithful receive with docility the teachings and directives 
that their pastors give them in different forms. 

The dogmas of the faith 

88 The Church's Magisterium exercises the authority it holds from 
Christ to the fullest extent when it defines dogmas, that is, when it 
proposes, in a form obliging the Christian people to an irrevocable 
adherence of faith, truths contained in divine Revelation or also when 
it proposes, in a definitive way, truths having a necessary connection 
with these. 

89 There is an organic connection between our spiritual life and the 
dogmas. Dogmas are lights along the path of faith; they illuminate it 
and make it secure. Conversely, if our life is upright, our intellect and 
heart will be open to welcome the light shed by the dogmas of faith.50 

90 The mutual connections between dogmas, and their coherence, can 
be found in the whole of the Revelation of the mystery of Christ.51 "In 
Catholic doctrine there exists an order or hierarchy 234 of truths, since 
they vary in their relation to the foundation of the Christian faith."52 

The supernatural sense of faith 



91 All the faithful share in understanding and handing on revealed 
truth. They have received the anointing of the Holy Spirit, who 
instructs them53 and guides them into all truth.54 

92 "The whole body of the faithful. . . cannot err in matters of belief. 
This characteristic is shown in the supernatural appreciation of faith 
(sensus fidei) on the part of the whole people, when, from the bishops 
to the last of the faithful, they manifest a universal consent in matters 
of faith and morals."55 

93 "By this appreciation of the faith, aroused and sustained by the 
Spirit of truth, the People of God, guided by the sacred teaching 
authority (Magisterium),. . . receives. . . the faith, once for all delivered 
to the saints. . . the People unfailingly adheres to this faith, penetrates 
it more deeply with right judgment, and applies it more fully in daily 
life."56 

Growth in understanding the faith 

94 Thanks to the assistance of the Holy Spirit, the understanding of 
both the realities and the words of the heritage of faith is able to grow 
in the life of the Church:  

- "through the contemplation and study of believers who ponder these 
things in their hearts";57 it is in particular "theological research 
[which] deepens knowledge of revealed truth".58  

- "from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which [believers] 
experience",59 The sacred Scriptures "grow with the one who reads 
them."60  

- "from the preaching of those who have received, along with their right 
of succession in the episcopate, the sure charism of truth".61 

95 "It is clear therefore that, in the supremely wise arrangement of 
God, sacred Tradition, Sacred Scripture and the Magisterium of the 
Church are so connected and associated that one of them cannot stand 
without the others. Working together, each in its own way, under the 
action of the one Holy Spirit, they all contribute effectively to the 
salvation of souls."62

whole never ceases to welcome, to penetrate more deeply and to live 
more fully from the gift of divine Revelation.

Article 3 SACRED SCRIPTURE 

I. Christ - The Unique Word of Sacred Scripture 

101 In order to reveal himself to men, in the condescension of his 
goodness God speaks to them in human words: "Indeed the words of 
God, expressed in the words of men, are in every way like human 
language, just as the Word of the eternal Father, when he took on 
himself the flesh of human weakness, became like men."63 

102 Through all the words of Sacred Scripture, God speaks only one 
single Word, his one Utterance in whom he expresses himself 
completely:64 

You recall that one and the same Word of God extends throughout 
Scripture, that it is one and the same Utterance that resounds in the 
mouths of all the sacred writers, since he who was in the beginning 
God with God has no need of separate syllables; for he is not subject to 
time.65 

103 For this reason, the Church has always venerated the Scriptures as 
she venerates the Lord's Body. She never ceases to present to the 



faithful the bread of life, taken from the one table of God's Word and 
Christ's Body.66 

104 In Sacred Scripture, the Church constantly finds her nourishment 
and her strength, for she welcomes it not as a human word, "but as 
what it really is, the word of God".67 "In the sacred books, the Father 
who is in heaven comes lovingly to meet his children, and talks with 
them."68

II. Inspiration and Truth of Sacred Scripture 



105 God is the author of Sacred Scripture. "The divinely revealed 
realities, which are contained and presented in the text of Sacred 
Scripture, have been written down under the inspiration of the Holy 
Spirit."69 

"For Holy Mother Church, relying on the faith of the apostolic age, 
accepts as sacred and canonical the books of the Old and the New 
Testaments, whole and entire, with all their parts, on the grounds that, 
written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, they have God as their 
author, and have been handed on as such to the Church herself."70 

106 God inspired the human authors of the sacred books. "To 
compose the sacred books, God chose certain men who, all the while 
he employed them in this task, made full use of their own faculties and 
powers so that, though he acted in them and by them, it was as true 
authors that they consigned to writing whatever he wanted written, and 
no more."71 

107 The inspired books teach the truth. "Since therefore all that the 
inspired authors or sacred writers affirm should be regarded as 
affirmed by the Holy Spirit, we must acknowledge that the books of 
Scripture firmly, faithfully, and without error teach that truth which 
God, for the sake of our salvation, wished to see confided to the Sacred 
Scriptures."72 

108 Still, the Christian faith is not a "religion of the book". Christianity 
is the religion of the "Word" of God, " a word which is not a written 
and mute word, but the Word which is incarnate and living".73 If the 
Scriptures are not to remain a dead letter, Christ, the eternal Word of 
the living God, must, through the Holy Spirit, "open (our) minds to 
understand the Scriptures."74

Article 3 SACRED SCRIPTURE 

 

 

III. The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture 

109 In Sacred Scripture, God speaks to man in a human way. To 
interpret Scripture correctly, the reader must be attentive to what the 
human authors truly wanted to affirm, and to what God wanted to 
reveal to us by their words.75 

110 In order to discover the sacred authors' intention, the reader must 
take into account the conditions of their time and culture, the literary 
genres in use at that time, and the modes of feeling, speaking and 
narrating then current. "For the fact is that truth is differently 
presented and expressed in the various types of historical writing, in 
prophetical and poetical texts, and in other forms of literary 
expression."76 

111 But since Sacred Scripture is inspired, there is another and no less 
important principle of correct interpretation, without which Scripture 
would remain a dead letter. "Sacred Scripture must be read and 
interpreted in the light of the same Spirit by whom it was written."77 

The Second Vatican Council indicates three criteria for interpreting 
Scripture in accordance with the Spirit who inspired it.78 



112 Be especially attentive "to the content and unity of the whole 
Scripture". Different as the books which compose it may be, Scripture 
is a unity by reason of the unity of God's plan, of which Christ Jesus is 
the center and heart, open since his Passover.79 

The phrase "heart of Christ" can refer to Sacred Scripture, which 
makes known his heart, closed before the Passion, as the Scripture was 
obscure. But the Scripture has been opened since the Passion; since 
those who from then on have understood it, consider and discern in 
what way the prophecies must be interpreted.80 

113 2. Read the Scripture within "the living Tradition of the whole 
Church". According to a saying of the Fathers, Sacred Scripture is 
written principally in the Church's heart rather than in documents and 
records, for the Church carries in her Tradition the living memorial of 
God's Word, and it is the Holy Spirit who gives her the spiritual 
interpretation of the Scripture (". . . according to the spiritual meaning 
which the Spirit grants to the Church"81). 

114 3. Be attentive to the analogy of faith.82 By "analogy of faith" we 
mean the coherence of the truths of faith among themselves and within 
the whole plan of Revelation. 

The senses of Scripture 

115 According to an ancient tradition, one can distinguish between 
two senses of Scripture: the literal and the spiritual, the latter being 
subdivided into the allegorical, moral and anagogical senses. the 
profound concordance of the four senses guarantees all its richness to 
the living reading of Scripture in the Church. 

116 The literal sense is the meaning conveyed by the words of 
Scripture and discovered by exegesis, following the rules of sound 
interpretation: "All other senses of Sacred Scripture are based on the 
literal."83 

117 The spiritual sense. Thanks to the unity of God's plan, not only the 
text of Scripture but also the realities and events about which it speaks 
can be signs.  

1. the allegorical sense. We can acquire a more profound understanding 
of events by recognizing their significance in Christ; thus the crossing 



of the Red Sea is a sign or type of Christ's victory and also of Christian 
Baptism.84  

2. the moral sense. the events reported in Scripture ought to lead us to 
act justly. As St. Paul says, they were written "for our instruction".85  

3. the anagogical sense (Greek: anagoge, "leading"). We can view 
realities and events in terms of their eternal significance, leading us 
toward our true homeland: thus the Church on earth is a sign of the 
heavenly Jerusalem.86 

118 A medieval couplet summarizes the significance of the four senses: 

The Letter speaks of deeds; Allegory to faith;  

The Moral how to act; Anagogy our destiny.87 

119 "It is the task of exegetes to work, according to these rules, 
towards a better understanding and explanation of the meaning of 
Sacred Scripture in order that their research may help the Church to 
form a firmer judgement. For, of course, all that has been said about 
the manner of interpreting Scripture is ultimately subject to the 
judgement of the Church which exercises the divinely conferred 
commission and ministry of watching over and interpreting the Word 
of God."88 

But I would not believe in the Gospel, had not the authority of the 
Catholic Church already moved me.89

IV. The Canon of Scripture 

120 It was by the apostolic Tradition that the Church discerned which 
writings are to be included in the list of the sacred books.90 

This complete list is called the canon of Scripture. It includes 46 books 
for the Old Testament (45 if we count Jeremiah and Lamentations as 
one) and 27 for the New.91 

The Old Testament: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, 
Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, 1 
and 2 Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah, Tobit, Judith, Esther, 1 and 2 
Maccabees, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, the Song of Songs, the 
Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach (Ecclesiasticus), Isaiah, Jeremiah, 
Lamentations, Baruch, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, 
Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zachariah and 
Malachi. 

  

The New Testament: the Gospels according to Matthew, Mark, Luke 
and John, the Acts of the Apostles, the Letters of St. Paul to the 
Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, 



Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, 
the Letter to the Hebrews, the Letters of James, 1 and 2 Peter, 1, 2 and 
3 John, and Jude, and Revelation (the Apocalypse). 

The Old Testament 

121 The Old Testament is an indispensable part of Sacred Scripture. 
Its books are divinely inspired and retain a permanent value,92 for the 
Old Covenant has never been revoked. 

122 Indeed, "the economy of the Old Testament was deliberately SO 
oriented that it should prepare for and declare in prophecy the coming 
of Christ, redeemer of all men."93 "Even though they contain matters 
imperfect and provisional,94 The books of the OldTestament bear 
witness to the whole divine pedagogy of God's saving love: these 
writings "are a storehouse of sublime teaching on God and of sound 
wisdom on human life, as well as a wonderful treasury of prayers; in 
them, too, the mystery of our salvation is present in a hidden way."95 

123 Christians venerate the Old Testament as true Word of God. the 
Church has always vigorously opposed the idea of rejecting the Old 
Testament under the pretext that the New has rendered it void 
(Marcionism). 

The New Testament 

124 "The Word of God, which is the power of God for salvation to 
everyone who has faith, is set forth and displays its power in a most 
wonderful way in the writings of the New Testament"96 which hand on 
the ultimate truth of God's Revelation. Their central object is Jesus 
Christ, God's incarnate Son: his acts, teachings, Passion and 
glorification, and his Church's beginnings under the Spirit's 
guidance.97 

125 The Gospels are the heart of all the Scriptures "because they are 
our principal source for the life and teaching of the Incarnate Word, 
our Saviour".98 

126 We can distinguish three stages in the formation of the Gospels:  

1. the life and teaching of Jesus. the Church holds firmly that the four 
Gospels, "whose historicity she unhesitatingly affirms, faithfully hand 



on what Jesus, the Son of God, while he lived among men, really did 
and taught for their eternal salvation, until the day when he was taken 
up."99  

2. the oral tradition. "For, after the ascension of the Lord, the apostles 
handed on to their hearers what he had said and done, but with that 
fuller understanding which they, instructed by the glorious events of 
Christ and enlightened by the Spirit of truth, now enjoyed."100  

3. the written Gospels. "The sacred authors, in writing the four 
Gospels, selected certain of the many elements which had been handed 
on, either orally or already in written form; others they synthesized or 
explained with an eye to the situation of the churches, the while 
sustaining the form of preaching, but always in such a fashion that they 
have told us the honest truth about Jesus."101 

127 The fourfold Gospel holds a unique place in the Church, as is 
evident both in the veneration which the liturgy accords it and in the 
surpassing attraction it has exercised on the saints at all times: 

There is no doctrine which could be better, more precious and more 
splendid than the text of the Gospel. Behold and retain what our Lord 
and Master, Christ, has taught by his words and accomplished by his 
deeds.102 

But above all it's the gospels that occupy my mind when I'm at prayer; 
my poor soul has so many needs, and yet this is the one thing needful. 
I'm always finding fresh lights there; hidden meanings which had 
meant nothing to me hitherto.103 

The unity of the Old and New Testaments 

128 The Church, as early as apostolic times,104 and then constantly in 
her Tradition, has illuminated the unity of the divine plan in the two 
Testaments through typology, which discerns in God's works of the 
Old Covenant prefigurations of what he accomplished in the fullness of 
time in the person of his incarnate Son. 

129 Christians therefore read the Old Testament in the light of Christ 
crucified and risen. Such typological reading discloses the 
inexhaustible content of the Old Testament; but it must not make us 
forget that the Old Testament retains its own intrinsic value as 



Revelation reaffirmed by our Lord himself.105 Besides, the New 
Testament has to be read in the light of the Old. Early Christian 
catechesis made constant use of the Old Testament.106 As an old 
saying put it, the New Testament lies hidden in the Old and the Old 
Testament is unveiled in the New.107 

130 Typology indicates the dynamic movement toward the fulfilment 
of the divine plan when "God [will] be everything to everyone."108 
Nor do the calling of the patriarchs and the exodus from Egypt, for 
example, lose their own value in God's plan, from the mere fact that 
they were intermediate stages.

V. Sacred Scripture in the Life of the Church 

131 "and such is the force and power of the Word of God that it can 
serve the Church as her support and vigour, and the children of the 
Church as strength for their faith, food for the soul, and a pure and 
lasting fount of spiritual life."109 Hence "access to Sacred Scripture 
ought to be open wide to the Christian faithful."110 

132 "Therefore, the study of the sacred page should be the very soul of 
sacred theology. the ministry of the Word, too - pastoral preaching, 
catechetics and all forms of Christian instruction, among which the 
liturgical homily should hold pride of place - is healthily nourished and 
thrives in holiness through the Word of Scripture."111 

133 The Church "forcefully and specifically exhorts all the Christian 
faithful... to learn the surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ, by 



frequent reading of the divine Scriptures. Ignorance of the Scriptures is 
ignorance of Christ.112

Article 3 SACRED SCRIPTURE 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

134 "All Sacred Scripture is but one book, and that one book is Christ, 
because all divine Scripture speaks of Christ, and all divine Scripture is 
fulfilled in Christ" (Hugh of St. Victor, De arca Noe 2, 8: PL 176, 642; 
cf. ibid, 2, 9: PL. 176, 642-643). 

135 "The Sacred Scriptures contain the Word of God and, because 
they are inspired, they are truly the Word of God" (DV 24). 

136 God is the author of Sacred Scripture because he inspired its 
human authors; he acts in them and by means of them. He thus gives 
assurance that their writings teach without error his saving truth (cf 
DV 11). 

137 Interpretation of the inspired Scripture must be attentive above all 
to what God wants to reveal through the sacred authors for our 



salvation. What comes from the Spirit is not fully "understood except 
by the Spirit's action' (cf. Origen, Hom. in Ex. 4, 5: PG 12, 320). 

138 The Church accepts and venerates as inspired the 46 books of the 
Old Testament and the 27 books of the New. 

139 The four Gospels occupy a central place because Christ Jesus is 
their centre. 

140 The unity of the two Testaments proceeds from the unity of God's 
plan and his Revelation. the Old Testament prepares for the New and 
the New Testament fulfils the Old; the two shed light on each other; 
both are true Word of God. 

141 "The Church has always venerated the divine Scriptures as she 
venerated the Body of the Lord" (DV 21): both nourish and govern the 
whole Christian life. "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my 
path" (Ps 119:105; cf. Is 50:4).

CHAPTER THREE MAN'S RESPONSE TO GOD 

142 By his Revelation, "the invisible God, from the fullness of his love, 
addresses men as his friends, and moves among them, in order to invite 
and receive them into his own company."1 The adequate response to 
this invitation is faith. 

143 By faith, man completely submits his intellect and his will to 
God.2 With his whole being man gives his assent to God the revealer. 
Sacred Scripture calls this human response to God, the author of 
revelation, "the obedience of faith".3

I. The Obedience of Faith 

144 To obey (from the Latin ob-audire, to "hear or listen to") in faith is 
to submit freely to the word that has been heard, because its truth is 
guaranteed by God, who is Truth itself. Abraham is the model of such 
obedience offered us by Sacred Scripture. the Virgin Mary is its most 
perfect embodiment. 

Abraham - "father of all who believe" 

145 The Letter to the Hebrews, in its great eulogy of the faith of 
Israel's ancestors, lays special emphasis on Abraham's faith: "By faith, 
Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place which he was 
to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he 
was to go."4 By faith, he lived as a stranger and pilgrim in the 



promised land.5 By faith, Sarah was given to conceive the son of the 
promise. and by faith Abraham offered his only son in sacrifice.6 

146 Abraham thus fulfils the definition of faith in Hebrews 11:1: 
"Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not 
seen":7 "Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as 
righteousness."8 Because he was "strong in his faith", Abraham became 
the "father of all who believe".9 

147 The Old Testament is rich in witnesses to this faith. the Letter to 
the Hebrews proclaims its eulogy of the exemplary faith of the 
ancestors who "received divine approval".10 Yet "God had foreseen 
something better for us": the grace of believing in his Son Jesus, "the 
pioneer and perfecter of our faith".11 

Mary - "Blessed is she who believed" 

148 The Virgin Mary most perfectly embodies the obedience of faith. 
By faith Mary welcomes the tidings and promise brought by the angel 
Gabriel, believing that "with God nothing will be impossible" and so 
giving her assent: "Behold I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be 
[done] to me according to your word."12 Elizabeth greeted her: 
"Blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfilment of what 
was spoken to her from the Lord."13 It is for this faith that all 
generations have called Mary blessed.14 
 

149 Throughout her life and until her last ordeal15 when Jesus her son 
died on the cross, Mary's faith never wavered. She never ceased to 
believe in the fulfilment of God's word. and so the Church venerates in 
Mary the purest realization of faith.

II. "I Know Whom I Have Believed"16 

To believe in God alone 

150 Faith is first of all a personal adherence of man to God. At the 
same time, and inseparably, it is a free assent to the whole truth that 
God has revealed. As personal adherence to God and assent to his 
truth, Christian faith differs from our faith in any human person. It is 
right and just to entrust oneself wholly to God and to believe 
absolutely what he says. It would be futile and false to place such faith 
in a creature.17 

To believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God 

151 For a Christian, believing in God cannot be separated from 
believing in the One he sent, his "beloved Son", in whom the Father is 
"well pleased"; God tells us to listen to him.18 The Lord himself said 
to his disciples: "Believe in God, believe also in me."19 We can believe 
in Jesus Christ because he is himself God, the Word made flesh: "No 
one has ever seen God; the only Son, who is in the bosom of the 
Father, he has made him known."20 Because he "has seen the Father", 
Jesus Christ is the only one who knows him and can reveal him.21 

To believe in the Holy Spirit 

152 One cannot believe in Jesus Christ without sharing in his Spirit. It 
is the Holy Spirit who reveals to men who Jesus is. For "no one can say 
"Jesus is Lord", except by the Holy Spirit",22 who "searches 
everything, even the depths of God. . No one comprehends the 
thoughts of God, except the Spirit of God."23 Only God knows God 
completely: we believe in the Holy Spirit because he is God. 

The Church never ceases to proclaim her faith in one only God: 
Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

III. The Characteristics of Faith 

Faith is a grace 



153 When St. Peter confessed that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the 
living God, Jesus declared to him that this revelation did not come 
"from flesh and blood", but from "my Father who is in heaven".24 
Faith is a gift of God, a supernatural virtue infused by him. "Before 
this faith can be exercised, man must have the grace of God to move 
and assist him; he must have the interior helps of the Holy Spirit, who 
moves the heart and converts it to God, who opens the eyes of the 
mind and 'makes it easy for all to accept and believe the truth.'"25 

Faith is a human act 

154 Believing is possible only by grace and the interior helps of the 
Holy Spirit. But it is no less true that believing is an authentically 
human act. Trusting in God and cleaving to the truths he has revealed 
is contrary neither to human freedom nor to human reason. Even in 
human relations it is not contrary to our dignity to believe what other 
persons tell us about themselves and their intentions, or to trust their 
promises (for example, when a man and a woman marry) to share a 
communion of life with one another. If this is so, still less is it contrary 
to our dignity to "yield by faith the full submission of... intellect and 
will to God who reveals",26 and to share in an interior communion 
with him. 

155 In faith, the human intellect and will co-operate with divine grace: 
"Believing is an act of the intellect assenting to the divine truth by 
command of the will moved by God through grace."27 

Faith and understanding 

156 What moves us to believe is not the fact that revealed truths appear 
as true and intelligible in the light of our natural reason: we believe 
"because of the authority of God himself who reveals them, who can 
neither deceive nor be deceived".28 So "that the submission of our 
faith might nevertheless be in accordance with reason, God willed that 
external proofs of his Revelation should be joined to the internal helps 
of the Holy Spirit."29 Thus the miracles of Christ and the saints, 
prophecies, the Church's growth and holiness, and her fruitfulness and 
stability "are the most certain signs of divine Revelation, adapted to the 
intelligence of all"; they are "motives of credibility" (motiva 



credibilitatis), which show that the assent of faith is "by no means a 
blind impulse of the mind".30 

157 Faith is certain. It is more certain than all human knowledge 
because it is founded on the very word of God who cannot lie. To be 
sure, revealed truths can seem obscure to human reason and 
experience, but "the certainty that the divine light gives is greater than 
that which the light of natural reason gives."31 "Ten thousand 
difficulties do not make one doubt."32 

158 "Faith seeks understanding":33 it is intrinsic to faith that a believer 
desires to know better the One in whom he has put his faith, and to 
understand better what He has revealed; a more penetrating knowledge 
will in turn call forth a greater faith, increasingly set afire by love. the 
grace of faith opens "the eyes of your hearts"34 to a lively 
understanding of the contents of Revelation: that is, of the totality of 
God's plan and the mysteries of faith, of their connection with each 
other and with Christ, the centre of the revealed mystery. "The same 
Holy Spirit constantly perfects faith by his gifts, so that Revelation may 
be more and more profoundly understood."35 In the words of St. 
Augustine, "I believe, in order to understand; and I understand, the 
better to believe."36 

159 Faith and science: "Though faith is above reason, there can never 
be any real discrepancy between faith and reason. Since the same God 
who reveals mysteries and infuses faith has bestowed the light of reason 
on the human mind, God cannot deny himself, nor can truth ever 
contradict truth."37 "Consequently, methodical research in all 
branches of knowledge, provided it is carried out in a truly scientific 
manner and does not override moral laws, can never conflict with the 
faith, because the things of the world and the things of faith derive 
from the same God. the humble and persevering investigator of the 
secrets of nature is being led, as it were, by the hand of God in spite of 
himself, for it is God, the conserver of all things, who made them what 
they are."38 

The freedom of faith 

160 To be human, "man's response to God by faith must be free, and... 
therefore nobody is to be forced to embrace the faith against his will. 



the act of faith is of its very nature a free act."39 "God calls men to 
serve him in spirit and in truth. Consequently they are bound to him 
in conscience, but not coerced. . . This fact received its fullest 
manifestation in Christ Jesus."40 Indeed, Christ invited people to faith 
and conversion, but never coerced them. "For he bore witness to the 
truth but refused to use force to impose it on those who spoke against 
it. His kingdom... grows by the love with which Christ, lifted up on the 
cross, draws men to himself."41 

The necessity of faith 

161 Believing in Jesus Christ and in the One who sent him for our 
salvation is necessary for obtaining that salvation.42 "Since "without 
faith it is impossible to please (God) " and to attain to the fellowship of 
his sons, therefore without faith no one has ever attained justification, 
nor will anyone obtain eternal life 'But he who endures to the end.'"] 

Perseverance in faith 

162 Faith is an entirely free gift that God makes to man. We can lose 
this priceless gift, as St. Paul indicated to St. Timothy: "Wage the good 
warfare, holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting conscience, 
certain persons have made shipwreck of their faith."44 To live, grow 
and persevere in the faith until the end we must nourish it with the 
word of God; we must beg the Lord to increase our faith;45 it must be 
"working through charity," abounding in hope, and rooted in the faith 
of the Church.46 

Faith - the beginning of eternal life 

163 Faith makes us taste in advance the light of the beatific vision, the 
goal of our journey here below. Then we shall see God "face to face", 
"as he is".47 So faith is already the beginning of eternal life:  

When we contemplate the blessings of faith even now, as if gazing at a 
reflection in a mirror, it is as if we already possessed the wonderful 
things which our faith assures us we shall one day enjoy.48 

164 Now, however, "we walk by faith, not by sight";49 we perceive 
God as "in a mirror, dimly" and only "in part".50 Even though 
enlightened by him in whom it believes, faith is often lived in darkness 
and can be put to the test. the world we live in often seems very far 



from the one promised us by faith. Our experiences of evil and 
suffering, injustice and death, seem to contradict the Good News; they 
can shake our faith and become a temptation against it. 

165 It is then we must turn to the witnesses of faith: to Abraham, who 
"in hope... believed against hope";51 to the Virgin Mary, who, in "her 
pilgrimage of faith", walked into the "night of faith"52 in sharing the 
darkness of her son's suffering and death; and to so many others: 
"Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, 
let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and 
let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to 
Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith."53

Article 2 WE BELIEVE 

166 Faith is a personal act - the free response of the human person to 
the initiative of God who reveals himself. But faith is not an isolated 
act. No one can believe alone, just as no one can live alone.  

You have not given yourself faith as you have not given yourself life. the 
believer has received faith from others and should hand it on to others. 
Our love for Jesus and for our neighbour impels us to speak to others 
about our faith. Each believer is thus a link in the great chain of 
believers. I cannot believe without being carried by the faith of others, 
and by my faith I help support others in the faith. 

167 "I believe" (Apostles' Creed) is the faith of the Church professed 
personally by each believer, principally during Baptism. "We believe" 
(Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed) is the faith of the Church 



confessed by the bishops assembled in council or more generally by the 
liturgical assembly of believers. "I believe" is also the Church, our 
mother, responding to God by faith as she teaches us to say both "I 
believe" and "We believe".

I. "Lord, Look Upon the Faith of Your Church" 

168 It is the Church that believes first, and so bears, nourishes and 
sustains my faith. Everywhere, it is the Church that first confesses the 
Lord: "Throughout the world the holy Church acclaims you", as we 
sing in the hymn Te Deum; with her and in her, we are won over and 
brought to confess: "I believe", "We believe". It is through the Church 
that we receive faith and new life in Christ by Baptism. In the Rituale 
Romanum, the minister of Baptism asks the catechumen: "What do 
you ask of God's Church?" and the answer is: "Faith." "What does faith 
offer you?" "Eternal life."54 

169 Salvation comes from God alone; but because we receive the life of 
faith through the Church, she is our mother: "We believe the Church 
as the mother of our new birth, and not in the Church as if she were 
the author of our salvation."55 Because she is our mother, she is also 
our teacher in the faith.

II. The Language of Faith 

170 We do not believe in formulae, but in those realities they express, 
which faith allows us to touch. "The believer's act [of faith] does not 
terminate in the propositions, but in the realities [which they 
express]."56 All the same, we do approach these realities with the help 
of formulations of the faith which permit us to express the faith and to 
hand it on, to celebrate it in community, to assimilate and live on it 
more and more. 



171 The Church, "the pillar and bulwark of the truth", faithfully guards 
"the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints". She guards 
the memory of Christ's words; it is she who from generation to 
generation hands on the apostles' confession of faith.57 As a mother 
who teaches her children to speak and so to understand and

III. Only One Faith 

172 Through the centuries, in so many languages, cultures, peoples 
and nations, the Church has constantly confessed this one faith, 
received from the one Lord, transmitted by one Baptism, and 
grounded in the conviction that all people have only one God and 
Father.58 St. Irenaeus of Lyons, a witness of this faith, declared: 

173 "Indeed, the Church, though scattered throughout the whole 
world, even to the ends of the earth, having received the faith from the 
apostles and their disciples. . . guards [this preaching and faith] with 
care, as dwelling in but a single house, and similarly believes as if 
having but one soul and a single heart, and preaches, teaches and 
hands on this faith with a unanimous voice, as if possessing only one 
mouth."59 

174 "For though languages differ throughout the world, the content of 
the Tradition is one and the same. the Churches established in 
Germany have no other faith or Tradition, nor do those of the Iberians, 
nor those of the Celts, nor those of the East, of Egypt, of Libya, nor 
those established at the centre of the world. . ."60 The Church's 
message "is true and solid, in which one and the same way of salvation 
appears throughout the whole world."61 



175 "We guard with care the faith that we have received from the 
Church, for without ceasing, under the action of God's Spirit, this 
deposit of great price, as if in an excellent vessel, is constantly being 
renewed and causes the very vessel that contains it to be renewed."62

IN BRIEF 

176 Faith is a personal adherence of the whole man to God who 
reveals himself. It involves an assent of the intellect and will to the self-
revelation God has made through his deeds and words. 

177 "To believe" has thus a twofold reference: to the person, and to the 
truth: to the truth, by trust in the person who bears witness to it. 

178 We must believe in no one but God: the Father, the Son and the 
Holy Spirit. 



179 Faith is a supernatural gift from God. In order to believe, man 
needs the interior helps of the Holy Spirit. 

180 "Believing" is a human act, conscious and free, corresponding to 
the dignity of the human person. 

181 "Believing" is an ecclesial act. the Church's faith precedes, 
engenders, supports and nourishes our faith. the Church is the mother 
of all believers. "No one can have God as Father who does not have the 
Church as Mother" (St. Cyprian, De unit. 6: PL 4, 519). 

182 We believe all "that which is contained in the word of God, written 
or handed down, and which the Church proposes for belief as divinely 
revealed" (Paul VI, CPG # 20). 

183 Faith is necessary for salvation. the Lord himself affirms: "He who 
believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will 
be condemned" (Mk 16:16). 

184 "Faith is a foretaste of the knowledge that will make us blessed in 
the life to come" (St. Thomas Aquinas. Comp. theol. 1, 2).

The Credo 

The Apostles Creed 

I believe in God the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth. 

I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord. 

He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the 
Virgin Mary 

Under Pontius Pilate He was crucified, died, and was buried.  

He descended to the dead. 

On the third day he rose again. 

He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.  

He will come again to judge the living and the dead. 

 

I believe in the Holy Spirit,  

the holy catholic Church,  



the communion of saints,  

the forgiveness of sins,  

the resurrection of the body,  

and the life everlasting.  

Amen. 

The Nicene Creed 

We believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty,  

maker of heaven and earth,  

of all that is, seen and unseen.  

We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,  

the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father,  

God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God,  

begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father.  

Through him all things were made.  

For us men and for our salvation, he came down from heaven:  

by the power of the Holy Spirit he was born of the Virgin Mary, and 
became man.  

For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered died 
and was buried.  

On the third day he rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures;  

he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.  

He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,  

and his kingdom will have no end.  

 

We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,  

who proceeds from the Father and the Son. 



With the Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified. 

He has spoken through the Prophets.  

We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.  

We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.  

We look for the resurrection of the dead,  

and the life of the world to come.  

Amen. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PART ONE: THE PROFESSION OF FAITH 

 

 

SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS 

185 Whoever says "I believe" says "I pledge myself to what we believe." 
Communion in faith needs a common language of faith, normative for 
all and uniting all in the same confession of faith. 

186 From the beginning, the apostolic Church expressed and handed 
on her faith in brief formulae normative for all.1 But already very early 
on, the Church also wanted to gather the essential elements of her faith 



into organic and articulated summaries, intended especially for 
candidates for Baptism: 

This synthesis of faith was not made to accord with human opinions, 
but rather what was of the greatest importance was gathered from all 
the Scriptures, to present the one teaching of the faith in its entirety. 
and just as the mustard seed contains a great number of branches in a 
tiny grain, so too this summary of faith encompassed in a few words 
the whole knowledge of the true religion contained in the Old and the 
New Testaments.2 

187 Such syntheses are called "professions of faith" since they 
summarize the faith that Christians profess. They are called "creeds" 
on account of what is usually their first word in Latin: credo ("I 
believe"). They are also called "symbols of faith". 

188 The Greek word symbolon meant half of a broken object, for 
example, a seal presented as a token of recognition. the broken parts 
were placed together to verify the bearer's identity. the symbol of faith, 
then, is a sign of recognition and communion between believers. 
Symbolon also means a gathering, collection or summary. A symbol of 
faith is a summary of the principal truths of the faith and therefore 
serves as the first and fundamental point of reference for catechesis. 

189 The first "profession of faith" is made during Baptism. the symbol 
of faith is first and foremost the baptismal creed. Since Baptism is 
given "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy 
Spirit",3 The truths of faith professed during Baptism are articulated 
in terms of their reference to the three persons of the Holy Trinity. 

190 and so the Creed is divided into three parts: "the first part speaks 
of the first divine Person and the wonderful work of creation; the next 
speaks of the second divine Person and the mystery of his redemption 
of men; the final part speaks of the third divine Person, the origin and 
source of our sanctification."4 These are "the three chapters of our 
[baptismal] seal".5 

191 "These three parts are distinct although connected with one 
another. According to a comparison often used by the Fathers, we call 
them articles. Indeed, just as in our bodily members there are certain 
articulations which distinguish and separate them, so too in this 



profession of faith, the name "articles" has justly and rightly been given 
to the truths we must believe particularly and distinctly."6 In 
accordance with an ancient tradition, already attested to by St. 
Ambrose, it is also customary to reckon the articles of the Creed as 
twelve, thus symbolizing the fullness of the apostolic faith by the 
number of the apostles.7 

192 Through the centuries many professions or symbols of faith have 
been articulated in response to the needs of the different eras: the 
creeds of the different apostolic and ancient Churches,8 e.g., the 
Quicumque, also called the Athanasian Creed;9 The professions of 
faith of certain Councils, such as Toledo, Lateran, Lyons, Trent;10 or 
the symbols of certain popes, e.g., the Fides Damasi11 or the Credo of 
the People of God of Paul VI.12 

193 None of the creeds from the different stages in the Church's life 
can be considered superseded or irrelevant. They help us today to 
attain and deepen the faith of all times by means of the different 
summaries made of it.  

Among all the creeds, two occupy a special place in the Church's life: 

194 The Apostles' Creed is so called because it is rightly considered to 
be a faithful summary of the apostles' faith. It is the ancient baptismal 
symbol of the Church of Rome. Its great authority arises from this fact: 
it is "the Creed of the Roman Church, the See of Peter the first of the 
apostles, to which he brought the common faith".13 

195 The Niceno-Constantinopolitan or Nicene Creed draws its great 
authority from the fact that it stems from the first two ecumenical 
Councils (in 325 and 381). It remains common to all the great 
Churches of both East and West to this day. 

196 Our presentation of the faith will follow the Apostles' Creed, which 
constitutes, as it were, "the oldest Roman catechism". the presentation 
will be completed however by constant references to the Nicene Creed, 
which is often more explicit and more detailed. 

197 As on the day of our Baptism, when our whole life was entrusted 
to the "standard of teaching",14 let us embrace the Creed of our life-
giving faith. To say the Credo with faith is to enter into communion 



with God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and also with the whole 
Church which transmits the faith to us and in whose midst we believe: 

This Creed is the spiritual seal, our heart's meditation and an ever-
present guardian; it is, unquestionably, the treasure of our soul.15

PART ONE: THE PROFESSION OF FAITH 

 

 

 

SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS 

 

 

CHAPTER ONE I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER 

198 Our profession of faith begins with God, for God is the First and 
the Last,1 The beginning and the end of everything. the Credo begins 
with God the Father, for the Father is the first divine person of the 
Most Holy Trinity; our Creed begins with the creation of heaven and 
earth, for creation is the beginning and the foundation of all God's 
works.

SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS 

 

 

 

CHAPTER ONE I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER 

 

 

Article 1 "I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY, 
CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH" 

Paragraph 1. I BELIEVE IN GOD 

199 "I believe in God": this first affirmation of the Apostles' Creed is 
also the most fundamental. the whole Creed speaks of God, and when 
it also speaks of man and of the world it does so in relation to God. the 
other articles of the Creed all depend on the first, just as the remaining 



Commandments make the first explicit. the other articles help us to 
know God better as he revealed himself progressively to men. "The 
faithful first profess their belief in God."2 

I. "I BELIEVE IN ONE GOD" 

200 These are the words with which the Niceno-Constantinopolitan 
Creed begins. the confession of God's oneness, which has its roots in 
the divine revelation of the Old Covenant, is inseparable from the 
profession of God's existence and is equally fundamental. God is 
unique; there is only one God: "The Christian faith confesses that God 
is one in nature, substance and essence."3 

201 To Israel, his chosen, God revealed himself as the only One: "Hear, 
O Israel: the LORD our God is one LORD; and you shall love the 
LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with 
all your might."4 Through the prophets, God calls Israel and all 
nations to turn to him, the one and only God: "Turn to me and be 
saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other.. . 
To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. 'Only in the 
LORD, it shall be said of me, are righteousness and strength.'"5 

202 Jesus himself affirms that God is "the one Lord" whom you must 
love "with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your 
mind, and with all your strength".6 At the same time Jesus gives us to 
understand that he himself is "the Lord".7 To confess that Jesus is Lord 
is distinctive of Christian faith. This is not contrary to belief in the One 
God. Nor does believing in the Holy Spirit as "Lord and giver of life" 
introduce any division into the One God: 

We firmly believe and confess without reservation that there is only one 
true God, eternal infinite (immensus) and unchangeable, 
incomprehensible, almighty and ineffable, the Father and the Son and 
the Holy Spirit; three persons indeed, but one essence, substance or 
nature entirely simple. 

II. GOD REVEALS HIS NAME 

203 God revealed himself to his people Israel by making his name 
known to them. A name expresses a person's essence and identity and 
the meaning of this person's life. God has a name; he is not an 



anonymous force. To disclose one's name is to make oneself known to 
others; in a way it is to hand oneself over by becoming accessible, 
capable of being known more intimately and addressed personally. 

204 God revealed himself progressively and under different names to 
his people, but the revelation that proved to be the fundamental one 
for both the Old and the New Covenants was the revelation of the 
divine name to Moses in the theophany of the burning bush, on the 
threshold of the Exodus and of the covenant on Sinai. 

The living God 

205 God calls Moses from the midst of a bush that bums without 
being consumed: "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, 
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."9 God is the God of the 
fathers, the One who had called and guided the patriarchs in their 
wanderings. He is the faithful and compassionate God who remembers 
them and his promises; he comes to free their descendants from 
slavery. He is the God who, from beyond space and time, can do this 
and wills to do it, the God who will put his almighty power to work for 
this plan. 

"I Am who I Am" 

Moses said to God, "If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, 
'The God of your fathers has sent me to you', and they ask me, 'What is 
his name?' what shall I say to them?" God said to Moses, "I AM WHO 
I AM." and he said, "Say this to the people of Israel, 'I AM has sent me 
to you'. . . this is my name for ever, and thus I am to be remembered 
throughout all generations."10 

206 In revealing his mysterious name, YHWH ("I AM HE WHO IS", 
"I AM WHO AM" or "I AM WHO I AM"), God says who he is and by 
what name he is to be called. This divine name is mysterious just as 
God is mystery. It is at once a name revealed and something like the 
refusal of a name, and hence it better expresses God as what he is - 
infinitely above everything that we can understand or say: he is the 
"hidden God", his name is ineffable, and he is the God who makes 
himself close to men.11 



207 By revealing his name God at the same time reveals his 
faithfulness which is from everlasting to everlasting, valid for the past 
("I am the God of your father"), as for the future ("I will be with 
you").12 God, who reveals his name as "I AM", reveals himself as the 
God who is always there, present to his people in order to save them. 

208 Faced with God's fascinating and mysterious presence, man 
discovers his own insignificance. Before the burning bush, Moses takes 
off his sandals and veils his face in the presence of God's holiness.13 
Before the glory of the thrice-holy God, Isaiah cries out: "Woe is me! I 
am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips."14 Before the divine signs 
wrought by Jesus, Peter exclaims: "Depart from me, for I am a sinful 
man, O Lord."15 But because God is holy, he can forgive the man who 
realizes that he is a sinner before him: "I will not execute my fierce 
anger. . . for I am God and not man, the Holy One in your midst."16 
The apostle John says likewise: "We shall. . . reassure our hearts before 
him whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our 
hearts, and he knows everything."17 

209 Out of respect for the holiness of God, the people of Israel do not 
pronounce his name. In the reading of Sacred Scripture, the revealed 
name (YHWH) is replaced by the divine title "LORD" (in Hebrew 
Adonai, in Greek Kyrios). It is under this title that the divinity of Jesus 
will be acclaimed: "Jesus is LORD." 

  

"A God merciful and gracious" 

210 After Israel's sin, when the people had turned away from God to 
worship the golden calf, God hears Moses' prayer of intercession and 
agrees to walk in the midst of an unfaithful people, thus demonstrating 
his love.18 When Moses asks to see his glory, God responds "I will 
make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim before you 
my name "the LORD" [YHWH]."19 Then the LORD passes before 
Moses and proclaims, "YHWH, 

YHWH, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in 
steadfast love and faithfulness"; Moses then confesses that the LORD 
is a forgiving God.20 



211 The divine name, "I Am" or "He Is", expresses God's faithfulness: 
despite the faithlessness of men's sin and the punishment it deserves, 
he keeps "steadfast love for thousands".21 By going so far as to give up 
his own Son for us, God reveals that he is "rich in mercy".22 By giving 
his life to free us from sin, Jesus reveals that he himself bears the divine 
name: "When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will realize 
that "I AM"."23 

God alone IS 

212 Over the centuries, Israel's faith was able to manifest and deepen 
realization of the riches contained in the revelation of the divine name. 
God is unique; there are no other gods besides him.24 

He transcends the world and history. He made heaven and earth: 
"They will perish, but you endure; they will all wear out like a 
garment....but you are the same, and your years have no end."25 

In God "there is no variation or shadow due to change."26 God is "HE 
WHO IS", from everlasting to everlasting, and as such remains ever 
faithful to himself and to his promises. 

213 The revelation of the ineffable name "I AM WHO AM" contains 
then the truth that God alone IS. the Greek Septuagint translation of 
the Hebrew Scriptures, and following it the Church's Tradition, 
understood the divine name in this sense: God is the fullness of Being 
and of every perfection, without origin and without end. All creatures 
receive all that they are and have from him; but he alone is his very 
being, and he is of himself everything that he is. 

III. GOD, "HE WHO IS", IS TRUTH AND LOVE 

214 God, "HE WHO IS", revealed himself to Israel as the one 
"abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness".27 These two terms 
express summarily the riches of the divine name. In all his works God 
displays, not only his kindness, goodness, grace and steadfast love, but 
also his trustworthiness, constancy, faithfulness and truth. "I give 
thanks to your name for your steadfast love and your faithfulness."28 
He is the Truth, for "God is light and in him there is no darkness"; 
"God is love", as the apostle John teaches.29 

God is Truth 



215 "The sum of your word is truth; and every one of your righteous 
ordinances endures forever."30 "and now, O LORD God, you are God, 
and your words are true";31 this is why God's promises always come 
true.32 God is Truth itself, whose words cannot deceive. This is why 
one can abandon oneself in full trust to the truth and faithfulness of 
his word in all things. the beginning of sin and of man's fall was due to 
a lie of the tempter who induced doubt of God's word, kindness and 
faithfulness. 

216 God's truth is his wisdom, which commands the whole created 
order and governs the world.33 God, who alone made heaven and 
earth, can alone impart true knowledge of every created thing in 
relation to himself.34 

217 God is also truthful when he reveals himself - the teaching that 
comes from God is "true instruction".35 When he sends his Son into 
the world it will be "to bear witness to the truth":36 "We know that the 
Son of God has come and has given us understanding, to know him 
who is true."37 

God is Love 

218 In the course of its history, Israel was able to discover that God 
had only one reason to reveal himself to them, a single motive for 
choosing them from among all peoples as his special possession: his 
sheer gratuitous love.38 and thanks to the prophets Israel understood 
that it was again out of love that God never stopped saving them and 
pardoning their unfaithfulness and sins.39 

219 God's love for Israel is compared to a father's love for his son. His 
love for his people is stronger than a mother's for her children. God 
loves his people more than a bridegroom his beloved; his love will be 
victorious over even the worst infidelities and will extend to his most 
precious gift: "God so loved the world that he gave his only Son."40 

220 God's love is "everlasting":41 "For the mountains may depart and 
the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from 
you."42 Through Jeremiah, God declares to his people, "I have loved 
you with an everlasting love; therefore I have continued my faithfulness 
to you."43 



221 But St. John goes even further when he affirms that "God is 
love":44 God's very being is love. By sending his only Son and the 
Spirit of Love in the fullness of time, God has revealed his innermost 
secret:45 God himself is an eternal exchange of love, Father, Son and 
Holy Spirit, and he has destined us to share in that exchange. 

IV. THE IMPLICATIONS OF FAITH IN ONE GOD 

222 Believing in God, the only One, and loving him with all our being 
has enormous consequences for our whole life. 

223 It means coming to know God's greatness and majesty: "Behold, 
God is great, and we know him not."46 Therefore, we must "serve God 
first".47 

224 It means living in thanksgiving: if God is the only One, everything 
we are and have comes from him: "What have you that you did not 
receive?"48 "What shall I render to the LORD for all his bounty to 
me?"49 

225 It means knowing the unity and true dignity of all men: everyone 
is made in the image and likeness of God.50 

226 It means making good use of created things: faith in God, the only 
One, leads us to use everything that is not God only insofar as it brings 
us closer to him, and to detach ourselves from it insofar as it turns us 
away from him:  

My Lord and my God, take from me everything that distances me 
from you.  

My Lord and my God, give me everything that brings me closer to you  

My Lord and my God, detach me from myself to give my all to you.51 

227 It means trusting God in every circumstance, even in adversity. A 
prayer of St. Teresa of Jesus wonderfully expresses this trust: 

Let nothing trouble you / Let nothing frighten you Everything passes / 
God never changes Patience / Obtains all Whoever has God / Wants for 
nothing God alone is enough.52 

IN BRIEF 



228 "Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God is one LORD..." (Dt 6:4; Mk 
12:29). "The supreme being must be unique, without equal. . . If God 
is not one, he is not God" (Tertullian, Adv. Marc., 1, 3, 5: PL 2, 274). 

229 Faith in God leads us to turn to him alone as our first origin and 
our ultimate goal, and neither to prefer anything to him nor to 
substitute anything for him. 

230 Even when he reveals himself, God remains a mystery beyond 
words: "If you understood him, it would not be God" (St. Augustine, 
Sermo 52, 6, 16: PL 38, 360 and Sermo 117, 3, 5: PL 38, 663). 

231 The God of our faith has revealed himself as HE WHO IS; and he 
has made himself known as "abounding in steadfast love and 
faithfulness" (Ex 34:6). God's very being is Truth and Love.

PART ONE: THE PROFESSION OF FAITH 

 

 

 

SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS 

 

 

 

CHAPTER ONE I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER 



 

 

 

Article 1 "I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY, 
CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH" 

 

 

Paragraph 2. THE FATHER 

I. "IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND OF THE SON AND 
OF THE HOLY SPIRIT" 

232 Christians are baptized "in the name of the Father and of the Son 
and of the Holy Spirit"53 Before receiving the sacrament, they respond 
to a three-part question when asked to confess the Father, the Son and 
the Spirit: "I do." "The faith of all Christians rests on the Trinity."54 

233 Christians are baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son 
and of the Holy Spirit: not in their names,55 for there is only one God, 
the almighty Father, his only Son and the Holy Spirit: the Most Holy 
Trinity. 

234 The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the central mystery of 
Christian faith and life. It is the mystery of God in himself. It is 
therefore the source of all the other mysteries of faith, the light that 
enlightens them. It is the most fundamental and essential teaching in 
the "hierarchy of the truths of faith".56 The whole history of salvation 
is identical with the history of the way and the means by which the one 
true God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, reveals himself to men "and 
reconciles and unites with himself those who turn away from sin".57 

235 This paragraph expounds briefly (I) how the mystery of the 
Blessed Trinity was revealed, (II) how the Church has articulated the 
doctrine of the faith regarding this mystery, and (III) how, by the 
divine missions of the Son and the Holy Spirit, God the Father fulfils 
the "plan of his loving goodness" of creation, redemption and 
sanctification. 



236 The Fathers of the Church distinguish between theology 
(theologia) and economy (oikonomia). "Theology" refers to the 
mystery of God's inmost life within the Blessed Trinity and "economy" 
to all the works by which God reveals himself and communicates his 
life. Through the oikonomia the theologia is revealed to us; but 
conversely, the theologia illuminates the whole oikonomia. God's works 
reveal who he is in himself; the mystery of his inmost being enlightens 
our understanding of all his works. So it is, analogously, among human 
persons. A person discloses himself in his actions, and the better we 
know a person, the better we understand his actions. 

237 The Trinity is a mystery of faith in the strict sense, one of the 
"mysteries that are hidden in God, which can never be known unless 
they are revealed by God".58 To be sure, God has left traces of his 
Trinitarian being in his work of creation and in his Revelation 
throughout the Old Testament. But his inmost Being as Holy Trinity is 
a mystery that is inaccessible to reason alone or even to Israel's faith 
before the Incarnation of God's Son and the sending of the Holy 
Spirit. 

II. THE REVELATION OF GOD AS TRINITY 

The Father revealed by the Son 

238 Many religions invoke God as "Father". the deity is often 
considered the "father of gods and of men". In Israel, God is called 
"Father" inasmuch as he is Creator of the world.59 Even more, God is 
Father because of the covenant and the gift of the law to Israel, "his 
first-born son".60 God is also called the Father of the king of Israel. 
Most especially he is "the Father of the poor", of the orphaned and the 
widowed, who are under his loving protection.61 

239 By calling God "Father", the language of faith indicates two main 
things: that God is the first origin of everything and transcendent 
authority; and that he is at the same time goodness and loving care for 
all his children. God's parental tenderness can also be expressed by the 
image of motherhood,62 which emphasizes God's immanence, the 
intimacy between Creator and creature. the language of faith thus 
draws on the human experience of parents, who are in a way the first 
representatives of God for man. But this experience also tells us that 



human parents are fallible and can disfigure the face of fatherhood and 
motherhood. We ought therefore to recall that God transcends the 
human distinction between the sexes. He is neither man nor woman: 
he is God. He also transcends human fatherhood and motherhood, 
although he is their origin and standard:63 no one is father as God is 
Father. 

240 Jesus revealed that God is Father in an unheard-of sense: he is 
Father not only in being Creator; he is eternally Father by his 
relationship to his only Son who is eternally Son only in relation to his 
Father: "No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows 
the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to 
reveal him."64 

241 For this reason the apostles confess Jesus to be the Word: "In the 
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word 
was God"; as "the image of the invisible God"; as the "radiance of the 
glory of God and the very stamp of his nature".65 
 

242 Following this apostolic tradition, the Church confessed at the first 
ecumenical council at Nicaea (325) that the Son is "consubstantial" 
with the Father, that is, one only God with him.66 The second 
ecumenical council, held at Constantinople in 381, kept this 
expression in its formulation of the Nicene Creed and confessed "the 
only-begotten Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, light from 
light, true God from true God, begotten not made, consubstantial with 
the Father".67 

The Father and the son revealed by the spirit 

243 Before his Passover, Jesus announced the sending of "another 
Paraclete" (Advocate), the Holy Spirit. At work since creation, having 
previously "spoken through the prophets", the Spirit will now be with 
and in the disciples, to teach them and guide them "into all the 
truth".68 The Holy Spirit is thus revealed as another divine person 
with Jesus and the Father. 

244 The eternal origin of the Holy Spirit is revealed in his mission in 
time. the Spirit is sent to the apostles and to the Church both by the 
Father in the name of the Son, and by the Son in person, once he had 



returned to the Father.69 The sending of the person of the Spirit after 
Jesus' glorification70 reveals in its fullness the mystery of the Holy 
Trinity. 

245 The apostolic faith concerning the Spirit was confessed by the 
second ecumenical council at Constantinople (381): "We believe in the 
Holy Spirit, the Lord and giver of life, who proceeds from the 
Father."71 By this confession, the Church recognizes the Father as 
"the source and origin of the whole divinity".72 But the eternal origin 
of the Spirit is not unconnected with the Son's origin: "The Holy 
Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, is God, one and equal with the 
Father and the Son, of the same substance and also of the same nature. 
. . Yet he is not called the Spirit of the Father alone,. . . but the Spirit of 
both the Father and the Son."73 The Creed of the Church from the 
Council of Constantinople confesses: "With the Father and the Son, he 
is worshipped and glorified."74 

246 The Latin tradition of the Creed confesses that the Spirit 
"proceeds from the Father and the Son (filioque)". the Council of 
Florence in 1438 explains: "The Holy Spirit is eternally from Father 
and Son; He has his nature and subsistence at once (simul) from the 
Father and the Son. He proceeds eternally from both as from one 
principle and through one spiration... And, since the Father has 
through generation given to the only-begotten Son everything that 
belongs to the Father, except being Father, the Son has also eternally 
from the Father, from whom he is eternally born, that the Holy Spirit 
proceeds from the Son."75 

247 The affirmation of the filioque does not appear in the Creed 
confessed in 381 at Constantinople. But Pope St. Leo I, following an 
ancient Latin and Alexandrian tradition, had already confessed it 
dogmatically in 447,76 even before Rome, in 451 at the Council of 
Chalcedon, came to recognize and receive the Symbol of 381. the use 
of this formula in the Creed was gradually admitted into the Latin 
liturgy (between the eighth and eleventh centuries). the introduction of 
the filioque into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed by the Latin 
liturgy constitutes moreover, even today, a point of disagreement with 
the Orthodox Churches. 



248 At the outset the Eastern tradition expresses the Father's character 
as first origin of the Spirit. By confessing the Spirit as he "who 
proceeds from the Father", it affirms that he comes from the Father 
through the Son.77 The Western tradition expresses first the 
consubstantial communion between Father and Son, by saying that the 
Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (filioque). It says this, 
"legitimately and with good reason",78 for the eternal order of the 
divine persons in their consubstantial communion implies that the 
Father, as "the principle without principle",79 is the first origin of the 
Spirit, but also that as Father of the only Son, he is, with the Son, the 
single principle from which the Holy Spirit proceeds.80 This legitimate 
complementarity, provided it does not become rigid, does not affect 
the identity of faith in the reality of the same mystery confessed. 

III. THE HOLY TRINITY IN THE TEACHING OF THE FAITH 

The formation of the Trinitarian dogma 

249 From the beginning, the revealed truth of the Holy Trinity has 
been at the very root of the Church's living faith, principally by means 
of Baptism. It finds its expression in the rule of baptismal faith, 
formulated in the preaching, catechesis and prayer of the Church. 
Such formulations are already found in the apostolic writings, such as 
this salutation taken up in the Eucharistic liturgy: "The grace of the 
Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy 
Spirit be with you all."81 
 

250 During the first centuries the Church sought to clarify her 
Trinitarian faith, both to deepen her own understanding of the faith 
and to defend it against the errors that were deforming it. This 
clarification was the work of the early councils, aided by the theological 
work of the Church Fathers and sustained by the Christian people's 
sense of the faith. 

251 In order to articulate the dogma of the Trinity, the Church had to 
develop her own terminology with the help of certain notions of 
philosophical origin: "substance", "person" or "hypostasis", "relation" 
and so on. In doing this, she did not submit the faith to human 
wisdom, but gave a new and unprecedented meaning to these terms, 



which from then on would be used to signify an ineffable mystery, 
"infinitely beyond all that we can humanly understand".82 

252 The Church uses (I) the term "substance" (rendered also at times 
by "essence" or "nature") to designate the divine being in its unity, (II) 
the term "person" or "hypostasis" to designate the Father, Son and 
Holy Spirit in the real distinction among them, and (III) the term 
"relation" to designate the fact that their distinction lies in the 
relationship of each to the others. 

The dogma of the Holy Trinity 

253 The Trinity is One. We do not confess three Gods, but one God in 
three persons, the "consubstantial Trinity".83 The divine persons do 
not share the one divinity among themselves but each of them is God 
whole and entire: "The Father is that which the Son is, the Son that 
which the Father is, the Father and the Son that which the Holy Spirit 
is, i.e. by nature one God."84 In the words of the Fourth Lateran 
Council (1215), "Each of the persons is that supreme reality, viz., the 
divine substance, essence or nature."85 

254 The divine persons are really distinct from one another. "God is 
one but not solitary."86 "Father", "Son", "Holy Spirit" are not simply 
names designating modalities of the divine being, for they are really 
distinct from one another: "He is not the Father who is the Son, nor is 
the Son he who is the Father, nor is the Holy Spirit he who is the 
Father or the Son."87 They are distinct from one another in their 
relations of origin: "It is the Father who generates, the Son who is 
begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds."88 The divine Unity is 
Triune. 

255 The divine persons are relative to one another. Because it does not 
divide the divine unity, the real distinction of the persons from one 
another resides solely in the relationships which relate them to one 
another: "In the relational names of the persons the Father is related to 
the Son, the Son to the Father, and the Holy Spirit to both. While they 
are called three persons in view of their relations, we believe in one 
nature or substance."89 Indeed "everything (in them) is one where 
there is no opposition of relationship."90 "Because of that unity the 
Father is wholly in the Son and wholly in the Holy Spirit; the Son is 



wholly in the Father and wholly in the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit is 
wholly in the Father and wholly in the Son."91 

256 St. Gregory of Nazianzus, also called "the Theologian", entrusts 
this summary of Trinitarian faith to the catechumens of 
Constantinople:  

Above all guard for me this great deposit of faith for which I live and 
fight, which I want to take with me as a companion, and which makes 
me bear all evils and despise all pleasures: I mean the profession of 
faith in the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. I entrust it to you 
today. By it I am soon going to plunge you into water and raise you up 
from it. I give it to you as the companion and patron of your whole life. 
I give you but one divinity and power, existing one in three, and 
containing the three in a distinct way. Divinity without disparity of 
substance or nature, without superior degree that raises up or inferior 
degree that casts down. . . the infinite co-naturality of three infinites. 
Each person considered in himself is entirely God. . . the three 
considered together. . . I have not even begun to think of unity when 
the Trinity bathes me in its splendour. I have not even begun to think 
of the Trinity when unity grasps me. .92 

IV. THE DIVINE WORKS AND THE TRINITARIAN MISSIONS 

257 "O blessed light, O Trinity and first Unity!"93 God is eternal 
blessedness, undying life, unfading light. God is love: Father, Son and 
Holy Spirit. God freely wills to communicate the glory of his blessed 
life. Such is the "plan of his loving kindness", conceived by the Father 
before the foundation of the world, in his beloved Son: "He destined us 
in love to be his sons" and "to be conformed to the image of his Son", 
through "the spirit of sonship".94 This plan is a "grace [which] was 
given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages began", stemming 
immediately from Trinitarian love.95 It unfolds in the work of creation, 
the whole history of salvation after the fall, and the missions of the Son 
and the Spirit, which are continued in the mission of the Church.96 

258 The whole divine economy is the common work of the three divine 
persons. For as the Trinity has only one and the same natures so too 
does it have only one and the same operation: "The Father, the Son 
and the Holy Spirit are not three principles of creation but one 



principle."97 However, each divine person performs the common work 
according to his unique personal property. Thus the Church confesses, 
following the New Testament, "one God and Father from whom all 
things are, and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom all things are, 
and one Holy Spirit in whom all things are".98 It is above all the divine 
missions of the Son's Incarnation and the gift of the Holy Spirit that 
show forth the properties of the divine persons. 

259 Being a work at once common and personal, the whole divine 
economy makes known both what is proper to the divine persons, and 
their one divine nature. Hence the whole Christian life is a communion 
with each of the divine persons, without in any way separating them. 
Everyone who glorifies the Father does so through the Son in the Holy 
Spirit; everyone who follows Christ does so because the Father draws 
him and the Spirit moves him.99 

260 The ultimate end of the whole divine economy is the entry of 
God's creatures into the perfect unity of the Blessed Trinity.100 But 
even now we are called to be a dwelling for the Most Holy Trinity: "If a 
man loves me", says the Lord, "he will keep my word, and my Father 
will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with 
him":101 

O my God, Trinity whom I adore, help me forget myself entirely so to 
establish myself in you, unmovable and peaceful as if my soul were 
already in eternity. May nothing be able to trouble my peace or make 
me leave you, O my unchanging God, but may each minute bring me 
more deeply into your mystery! Grant my soul peace. Make it your 
heaven, your beloved dwelling and the place of your rest. May I never 
abandon you there, but may I be there, whole and entire, completely 
vigilant in my faith, entirely adoring, and wholly given over to your 
creative action.102 

IN BRIEF 

261 The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the central mystery of the 
Christian faith and of Christian life. God alone can make it known to 
us by revealing himself as Father, Son and Holy Spirit. 

262 The Incarnation of God's Son reveals that God is the eternal 
Father and that the Son is consubstantial with the Father, which means 



that, in the Father and with the Father the Son is one and the same 
God. 

263 The mission of the Holy Spirit, sent by the Father in the name of 
the Son (Jn 14:26) and by the Son "from the Father" (Jn 15:26), 
reveals that, with them, the Spirit is one and the same God. "With the 
Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified" (Nicene Creed). 

264 "The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father as the first principle 
and, by the eternal gift of this to the Son, from the communion of both 
the Father and the Son" (St. Augustine, De Trin. 15, 26, 47: PL 42, 
1095). 

265 By the grace of Baptism "in the name of the Father and of the Son 
and of the Holy Spirit", we are called to share in the life of the Blessed 
Trinity, here on earth in the obscurity of faith, and after death in 
eternal light (cf. Paul VI, CPG # 9). 

266 "Now this is the Catholic faith: We worship one God in the Trinity 
and the Trinity in unity, without either confusing the persons or 
dividing the substance; for the person of the Father is one, the Son's is 
another, the Holy Spirit's another; but the Godhead of the Father, Son 
and Holy Spirit is one, their glory equal, their majesty coeternal" 
(Athanasian Creed: DS 75; ND 16). 

267 Inseparable in what they are, the divine persons are also 
inseparable in what they do. But within the single divine operation 
each shows forth what is proper to him in the Trinity, especially in the 
divine missions of the Son's Incarnation and the gift of the Holy Spirit.

PART ONE: THE PROFESSION OF FAITH 

 

 

 

SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS 

 

 

 

CHAPTER ONE I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER 

 

 

 

Article 1 "I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY, 
CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH" 

 

 

Paragraph 3. THE ALMIGHTY 

268 of all the divine attributes, only God's omnipotence is named in 
the Creed: to confess this power has great bearing on our lives. We 
believe that his might is universal, for God who created everything also 
rules everything and can do everything. God's power is loving, for he is 
our Father, and mysterious, for only faith can discern it when it "is 
made perfect in weakness".103 

"He does whatever he pleases"104 

269 The Holy Scriptures repeatedly confess the universal power of 
God. He is called the "Mighty One of Jacob", the "LORD of hosts", 
the "strong and mighty" one. If God is almighty "in heaven and on 
earth", it is because he made them.105 Nothing is impossible with 



God, who disposes his works according to his will.106 He is the Lord 
of the universe, whose order he established and which remains wholly 
subject to him and at his disposal. He is master of history, governing 
hearts and events in keeping with his will: "It is always in your power to 
show great strength, and who can withstand the strength of your 
arm?107 

"You are merciful to all, for you can do all thing"108 

270 God is the Father Almighty, whose fatherhood and power shed 
light on one another: God reveals his fatherly omnipotence by the way 
he takes care of our needs; by the filial adoption that he gives us ("I will 
be a father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, says the 
Lord Almighty"):109 finally by his infinite mercy, for he displays his 
power at its height by freely forgiving sins. 

271 God's almighty power is in no way arbitrary: "In God, power, 
essence, will, intellect, wisdom, and justice are all identical. Nothing 
therefore can be in God's power which could not be in his just will or 
his wise intellect."110 

The mystery of God's apparent powerlessness 

272 Faith in God the Father Almighty can be put to the test by the 
experience of evil and suffering. God can sometimes seem to be absent 
and incapable of stopping evil. But in the most mysterious way God 
the Father has revealed his almighty power in the voluntary 
humiliation and Resurrection of his Son, by which he conquered evil. 
Christ crucified is thus "the power of God and the wisdom of God. For 
the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is 
stronger than men."111 It is in Christ's Resurrection and exaltation 
that the Father has shown forth "the immeasurable greatness of his 
power in us who believe".112 

273 Only faith can embrace the mysterious ways of God's almighty 
power. This faith glories in its weaknesses in order to draw to itself 
Christ's power.113 The Virgin Mary is the supreme model of this faith, 
for she believed that "nothing will be impossible with God", and was 
able to magnify the Lord: "For he who is mighty has done great things 
for me, and holy is his name."114 



274 "Nothing is more apt to confirm our faith and hope than holding 
it fixed in our minds that nothing is impossible with God. Once our 
reason has grasped the idea of God's almighty power, it will easily and 
without any hesitation admit everything that [the Creed] will 
afterwards propose for us to believe - even if they be great and 
marvellous things, far above the ordinary laws of nature."115 

IN BRIEF 

275 With Job, the just man, we confess: "I know that you can do all 
things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted" (Job 42:2). 

276 Faithful to the witness of Scripture, the Church often addresses 
her prayer to the "almighty and eternal God" (“omnipotens sempiterne 
Deus. . ."), believing firmly that "nothing will be impossible with God" 
(Gen 18:14; Lk 1:37; Mt 19:26). 

277 God shows forth his almighty power by converting us from our 
sins and restoring us to his friendship by grace. "God, you show your 
almighty power above all in your mercy and forgiveness. . ." (Roman 
Missal, 26th Sunday, Opening Prayer). 

278 If we do not believe that God's love is almighty, how can we 
believe that the Father could create us, the Son redeem us and the 
Holy Spirit sanctify us?

CHAPTER ONE I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER 

 

 

 



Article 1 "I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY, 
CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH" 

 

 

Paragraph 4. THE CREATOR 

279 "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."116 oly 
Scripture begins with these solemn words. the profession of faith takes 
them up when it confesses that God the Father almighty is "Creator of 
heaven and earth" (Apostles' Creed), "of all that is, seen and unseen" 
(Nicene Creed). We shall speak first of the Creator, then of creation 
and finally of the fall into sin from which Jesus Christ, the Son of God, 
came to raise us up again. 

280 Creation is the foundation of "all God's saving plans," the 
"beginning of the history of salvation"117 that culminates in Christ. 
Conversely, the mystery of Christ casts conclusive light on the mystery 
of creation and reveals the end for which "in the beginning God 
created the heavens and the earth": from the beginning, God envisaged 
the glory of the new creation in Christ.118 

281 And so the readings of the Easter Vigil, the celebration of the new 
creation in Christ, begin with the creation account; likewise in the 
Byzantine liturgy, the account of creation always constitutes the first 
reading at the vigils of the great feasts of the Lord. According to 
ancient witnesses the instruction of catechumens for Baptism followed 
the same itinerary.119 

I. CATECHESIS ON CREATION 

282 Catechesis on creation is of major importance. It concerns the 
very foundations of human and Christian life: for it makes explicit the 
response of the Christian faith to the basic question that men of all 
times have asked themselves:120 "Where do we come from?" "Where 
are we going?" "What is our origin?" "What is our end?" "Where does 
everything that exists come from and where is it going?" the two 
questions, the first about the origin and the second about the end, are 
inseparable. They are decisive for the meaning and orientation of our 
life and actions. 



283 The question about the origins of the world and of man has been 
the object of many scientific studies which have splendidly enriched 
our knowledge of the age and dimensions of the cosmos, the 
development of life-forms and the appearance of man. These 
discoveries invite us to even greater admiration for the greatness of the 
Creator, prompting us to give him thanks for all his works and for the 
understanding and wisdom he gives to scholars and researchers. With 
Solomon they can say: "It is he who gave me unerring knowledge of 
what exists, to know the structure of the world and the activity of the 
elements. . . for wisdom, the fashioner of all things, taught me."121 

284 The great interest accorded to these studies is strongly stimulated 
by a question of another order, which goes beyond the proper domain 
of the natural sciences. It is not only a question of knowing when and 
how the universe arose physically, or when man appeared, but rather of 
discovering the meaning of such an origin: is the universe governed by 
chance, blind fate, anonymous necessity, or by a transcendent, 
intelligent and good Being called "God"? and if the world does come 
from God's wisdom and goodness, why is there evil? Where does it 
come from? Who is responsible for it? Is there any liberation from it? 

285 Since the beginning the Christian faith has been challenged by 
responses to the question of origins that differ from its own. Ancient 
religions and cultures produced many myths concerning origins. Some 
philosophers have said that everything is God, that the world is God, 
or that the development of the world is the development of God 
(Pantheism). Others have said that the world is a necessary emanation 
arising from God and returning to him. Still others have affirmed the 
existence of two eternal principles, Good and Evil, Light and 
Darkness, locked, in permanent conflict (Dualism, Manichaeism). 
According to some of these conceptions, the world (at least the 
physical world) is evil, the product of a fall, and is thus to be rejected 
or left behind (Gnosticism). Some admit that the world was made by 
God, but as by a watch-maker who, once he has made a watch, 
abandons it to itself (Deism). Finally, others reject any transcendent 
origin for the world, but see it as merely the interplay of matter that 
has always existed (Materialism). All these attempts bear witness to the 
permanence and universality of the question of origins. This inquiry is 
distinctively human. 



286 Human intelligence is surely already capable of finding a response 
to the question of origins. the existence of God the Creator can be 
known with certainty through his works, by the light of human 
reason,122 even if this knowledge is often obscured and disfigured by 
error. This is why faith comes to confirm and enlighten reason in the 
correct understanding of this truth: "By faith we understand that the 
world was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was made 
out of things which do not appear."123 

287 The truth about creation is so important for all of human life that 
God in his tenderness wanted to reveal to his People everything that is 
salutary to know on the subject. Beyond the natural knowledge that 
every man can have of the Creator,124 God progressively revealed to 
Israel the mystery of creation. He who chose the patriarchs, who 
brought Israel out of Egypt, and who by choosing Israel created and 
formed it, this same God reveals himself as the One to whom belong 
all the peoples of the earth, and the whole earth itself; he is the One 
who alone "made heaven and earth".125 

288 Thus the revelation of creation is inseparable from the revelation 
and forging of the covenant of the one God with his People. Creation 
is revealed as the first step towards this covenant, the first and 
universal witness to God's all-powerful love.126 and so, the truth of 
creation is also expressed with growing vigour in the message of the 
prophets, the prayer of the psalms and the liturgy, and in the wisdom 
sayings of the Chosen People.127 

289 Among all the Scriptural texts about creation, the first three 
chapters of Genesis occupy a unique place. From a literary standpoint 
these texts may have had diverse sources. the inspired authors have 
placed them at the beginning of Scripture to express in their solemn 
language the truths of creation - its origin and its end in God, its order 
and goodness, the vocation of man, and finally the drama of sin and 
the hope of salvation. Read in the light of Christ, within the unity of 
Sacred Scripture and in the living Tradition of the Church, these texts 
remain the principal source for catechesis on the mysteries of the 
"beginning": creation, fall, and promise of salvation. 

II. CREATION - WORK OF THE HOLY TRINITY 



290 "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth":128 
three things are affirmed in these first words of Scripture: the eternal 
God gave a beginning to all that exists outside of himself; he alone is 
Creator (the verb "create" - Hebrew bara - always has God for its 
subject). the totality of what exists (expressed by the formula "the 
heavens and the earth") depends on the One who gives it being. 

291 "In the beginning was the Word. . . and the Word was God. . . all 
things were made through him, and without him was not anything 
made that was made."129 The New Testament reveals that God 
created everything by the eternal Word, his beloved Son. In him "all 
things were created, in heaven and on earth.. . all things were created 
through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things 
hold together."130 The Church's faith likewise confesses the creative 
action of the Holy Spirit, the "giver of life", "the Creator Spirit" (Veni, 
Creator Spiritus), the "source of every good".131 

292 The Old Testament suggests and the New Covenant reveals the 
creative action of the Son and the Spirit,132 inseparably one with that 
of the Father. This creative co-operation is clearly affirmed in the 
Church's rule of faith: "There exists but one God. . . he is the Father, 
God, the Creator, the author, the giver of order. He made all things by 
himself, that is, by his Word and by his Wisdom", "by the Son and the 
Spirit" who, so to speak, are "his hands".133 Creation is the common 
work of the Holy Trinity. 

III. "THE WORLD WAS CREATED FOR THE GLORY OF GOD" 

293 Scripture and Tradition never cease to teach and celebrate this 
fundamental truth: "The world was made for the glory of God."134 St. 
Bonaventure explains that God created all things "not to increase his 
glory, but to show it forth and to communicate it",135 for God has no 
other reason for creating than his love and goodness: "Creatures came 
into existence when the key of love opened his hand."136 The First 
Vatican Council explains: 

This one, true God, of his own goodness and "almighty power", not for 
increasing his own beatitude, nor for attaining his perfection, but in 
order to manifest this perfection through the benefits which he bestows 
on creatures, with absolute freedom of counsel "and from the 



beginning of time, made out of nothing both orders of creatures, the 
spiritual and the corporeal. . ."137 

294 The glory of God consists in the realization of this manifestation 
and communication of his goodness, for which the world was created. 
God made us "to be his sons through Jesus Christ, according to the 
purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace",138 for "the 
glory of God is man fully alive; moreover man's life is the vision of 
God: if God's revelation through creation has already obtained life for 
all the beings that dwell on earth, how much more will the Word's 
manifestation of the Father obtain life for those who see God."139 The 
ultimate purpose of creation is that God "who is the creator of all 
things may at last become "all in all", thus simultaneously assuring his 
own glory and our beatitude."140 

IV. THE MYSTERY OF CREATION 

God creates by wisdom and love 

295 We believe that God created the world according to his 
wisdom.141 It is not the product of any necessity whatever, nor of 
blind fate or chance. We believe that it proceeds from God's free will; 
he wanted to make his creatures share in his being, wisdom and 
goodness: "For you created all things, and by your will they existed and 
were created."142 Therefore the Psalmist exclaims: "O LORD, how 
manifold are your works! In wisdom you have made them all"; and 
"The LORD is good to all, and his compassion is over all that he has 
made."143 God creates "out of nothing" 

296 We believe that God needs no pre-existent thing or any help in 
order to create, nor is creation any sort of necessary emanation from 
the divine substance.144 God creates freely "out of nothing":145 

If God had drawn the world from pre-existent matter, what would be 
so extraordinary in that? A human artisan makes from a given material 
whatever he wants, while God shows his power by starting from 
nothing to make all he wants.146 

297 Scripture bears witness to faith in creation "out of nothing" as a 
truth full of promise and hope. Thus the mother of seven sons 
encourages them for martyrdom: 



I do not know how you came into being in my womb. It was not I who 
gave you life and breath, nor I who set in order the elements within 
each of you. Therefore the Creator of the world, who shaped the 
beginning of man and devised the origin of all things, will in his mercy 
give life and breath back to you again, since you now forget yourselves 
for the sake of his laws. . . Look at the heaven and the earth and see 
everything that is in them, and recognize that God did not make them 
out of things that existed. Thus also mankind comes into being.147 

298 Since God could create everything out of nothing, he can also, 
through the Holy Spirit, give spiritual life to sinners by creating a pure 
heart in them,148 and bodily life to the dead through the 
Resurrection. God "gives life to the dead and calls into existence the 
things that do not exist."149 and since God was able to make light 
shine in darkness by his Word, he can also give the light of faith to 
those who do not yet know him.150 

God creates an ordered and good world 

299 Because God creates through wisdom, his creation is ordered: 
"You have arranged all things by measure and number and weight."151 
The universe, created in and by the eternal Word, the "image of the 
invisible God", is destined for and addressed to man, himself created in 
the "image of God" and called to a personal relationship with God.152 
Our human understanding, which shares in the light of the divine 
intellect, can understand what God tells us by means of his creation, 
though not without great effort and only in a spirit of humility and 
respect before the Creator and his work.153 Because creation comes 
forth from God's goodness, it shares in that goodness - "and God saw 
that it was good. . . very good"154- for God willed creation as a gift 
addressed to man, an inheritance destined for and entrusted to him. 
On many occasions the Church has had to defend the goodness of 
creation, including that of the physical world.155 

God transcends creation and is present to it 

300 God is infinitely greater than all his works: "You have set your 
glory above the heavens."156 Indeed, God's "greatness is 
unsearchable".157 But because he is the free and sovereign Creator, 
the first cause of all that exists, God is present to his creatures' inmost 



being: "In him we live and move and have our being."158 In the words 
of St. Augustine, God is "higher than my highest and more inward than 
my innermost self".159 

God upholds and sustains creation 

301 With creation, God does not abandon his creatures to themselves. 
He not only gives them being and existence, but also, and at every 
moment, upholds and sustains them in being, enables them to act and 
brings them to their final end. Recognizing this utter dependence with 
respect to the Creator is a source of wisdom and freedom, of joy and 
confidence: 

  

For you love all things that exist, and detest none of the things that you 
have made; for you would not have made anything if you had hated it. 
How would anything have endured, if you had not willed it? Or how 
would anything not called forth by you have been preserved? You spare 
all things, for they are yours, O Lord, you who love the living.160 

V. GOD CARRIES OUT HIS PLAN: DIVINE PROVIDENCE 

302 Creation has its own goodness and proper perfection, but it did 
not spring forth complete from the hands of the Creator. the universe 
was created "in a state of journeying" (in statu viae) toward an ultimate 
perfection yet to be attained, to which God has destined it. We call 
"divine providence" the dispositions by which God guides his creation 
toward this perfection: 

By his providence God protects and governs all things which he has 
made, "reaching mightily from one end of the earth to the other, and 
ordering all things well". For "all are open and laid bare to his eyes", 
even those things which are yet to come into existence through the free 
action of creatures.161 

303 The witness of Scripture is unanimous that the solicitude of divine 
providence is concrete and immediate; God cares for all, from the least 
things to the great events of the world and its history. the sacred books 
powerfully affirm God's absolute sovereignty over the course of events: 
"Our God is in the heavens; he does whatever he pleases."162 and so it 
is with Christ, "who opens and no one shall shut, who shuts and no 



one opens".163 As the book of Proverbs states: "Many are the plans in 
the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the LORD that will be 
established."164 

304 And so we see the Holy Spirit, the principal author of Sacred 
Scripture, often attributing actions to God without mentioning any 
secondary causes. This is not a "primitive mode of speech", but a 
profound way of recalling God's primacy and absolute Lordship over 
history and the world,165 and so of educating his people to trust in 
him. the prayer of the Psalms is the great school of this trust.166 

305 Jesus asks for childlike abandonment to the providence of our 
heavenly Father who takes care of his children's smallest needs: 
"Therefore do not be anxious, saying, "What shall we eat?" or "What 
shall we drink?". . . Your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. 
But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things 
shall be yours as well."167 

Providence and secondary causes 

306 God is the sovereign master of his plan. But to carry it out he also 
makes use of his creatures' co-operation. This use is not a sign of 
weakness, but rather a token of almighty God's greatness and 
goodness. For God grants his creatures not only their existence, but 
also the dignity of acting on their own, of being causes and principles 
for each other, and thus of co-operating in the accomplishment of his 
plan. 

307 To human beings God even gives the power of freely sharing in his 
providence by entrusting them with the responsibility of "subduing" 
the earth and having dominion over it.168 God thus enables men to be 
intelligent and free causes in order to complete the work of creation, to 
perfect its harmony for their own good and that of their neighbours. 
Though often unconscious collaborators with God's will, they can also 
enter deliberately into the divine plan by their actions, their prayers 
and their sufferings.169 They then fully become "God's fellow 
workers" and co-workers for his kingdom.170 

308 The truth that God is at work in all the actions of his creatures is 
inseparable from faith in God the Creator. God is the first cause who 
operates in and through secondary causes: "For God is at work in you, 



both to will and to work for his good pleasure."171 Far from 
diminishing the creature's dignity, this truth enhances it. Drawn from 
nothingness by God's power, wisdom and goodness, it can do nothing 
if it is cut off from its origin, for "without a Creator the creature 
vanishes."172 Still less can a creature attain its ultimate end without 
the help of God's grace.173 

Providence and the scandal of evil 

309 If God the Father almighty, the Creator of the ordered and good 
world, cares for all his creatures, why does evil exist? To this question, 
as pressing as it is unavoidable and as painful as it is mysterious, no 
quick answer will suffice. Only Christian faith as a whole constitutes 
the answer to this question: the goodness of creation, the drama of sin 
and the patient love of God who comes to meet man by his covenants, 
the redemptive Incarnation of his Son, his gift of the Spirit, his 
gathering of the Church, the power of the sacraments and his call to a 
blessed life to which free creatures are invited to consent in advance, 
but from which, by a terrible mystery, they can also turn away in 
advance. There is not a single aspect of the Christian message that is 
not in part an answer to the question of evil. 

310 But why did God not create a world so perfect that no evil could 
exist in it? With infinite power God could always create something 
better.174 But with infinite wisdom and goodness God freely willed to 
create a world "in a state of journeying" towards its ultimate perfection. 
In God's plan this process of becoming involves the appearance of 
certain beings and the disappearance of others, the existence of the 
more perfect alongside the less perfect, both constructive and 
destructive forces of nature. With physical good there exists also 
physical evil as long as creation has not reached perfection.175 

311 Angels and men, as intelligent and free creatures, have to journey 
toward their ultimate destinies by their free choice and preferential 
love. They can therefore go astray. Indeed, they have sinned. Thus has 
moral evil, incommensurably more harmful than physical evil, entered 
the world. God is in no way, directly or indirectly, the cause of moral 
evil.176 He permits it, however, because he respects the freedom of his 
creatures and, mysteriously, knows how to derive good from it: 



For almighty God. . ., because he is supremely good, would never allow 
any evil whatsoever to exist in his works if he were not so all-powerful 
and good as to cause good to emerge from evil itself.177 

312 In time we can discover that God in his almighty providence can 
bring a good from the consequences of an evil, even a moral evil, 
caused by his creatures: "It was not you", said Joseph to his brothers, 
"who sent me here, but God. . . You meant evil against me; but God 
meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept 
alive."178 From the greatest moral evil ever committed - the rejection 
and murder of God's only Son, caused by the sins of all men - God, by 
his grace that "abounded all the more",179 brought the greatest of 
goods: the glorification of Christ and our redemption. But for all that, 
evil never becomes a good. 

313 "We know that in everything God works for good for those who 
love him."180 The constant witness of the saints confirms this truth: 

St. Catherine of Siena said to "those who are scandalized and rebel 
against what happens to them": "Everything comes from love, all is 
ordained for the salvation of man, God does nothing without this goal 
in mind."181  

St. Thomas More, shortly before his martyrdom, consoled his 
daughter: "Nothing can come but that that God wills. and I make me 
very sure that whatsoever that be, seem it never so bad in sight, it shall 
indeed be the best."182  

Dame Julian of Norwich: "Here I was taught by the grace of God that I 
should steadfastly keep me in the faith... and that at the same time I 
should take my stand on and earnestly believe in what our Lord 
shewed in this time - that 'all manner (of) thing shall be well.'"183 

314 We firmly believe that God is master of the world and of its history. 
But the ways of his providence are often unknown to us. Only at the 
end, when our partial knowledge ceases, when we see God "face to 
face",184 will we fully know the ways by which - even through the 
dramas of evil and sin - God has guided his creation to that definitive 
sabbath rest185 for which he created heaven and earth. 

IN BRIEF 



315 In the creation of the world and of man, God gave the first and 
universal witness to his almighty love and his wisdom, the first 
proclamation of the "plan of his loving goodness", which finds its goal 
in the new creation in Christ. 

316 Though the work of creation is attributed to the Father in 
particular, it is equally a truth of faith that the Father, Son and Holy 
Spirit together are the one, indivisible principle of creation. 

317 God alone created the universe, freely, directly and without any 
help. 

318 No creature has the infinite power necessary to "create" in the 
proper sense of the word, that is, to produce and give being to that 
which had in no way possessed it to call into existence "out of 
nothing") (cf  DS 3624). 

319 God created the world to show forth and communicate his glory. 
That his creatures should share in his truth, goodness and beauty - this 
is the glory for which God created them. 

320 God created the universe and keeps it in existence by his Word, the 
Son "upholding the universe by his word of power" (Heb 1:3), and by 
his Creator Spirit, the giver of life. 

321 Divine providence consists of the dispositions by which God 
guides all his creatures with wisdom and love to their ultimate end. 

322 Christ invites us to filial trust in the providence of our heavenly 
Father (cf Mt 6:26-34), and St. Peter the apostle repeats: "Cast all your 
anxieties on him, for he cares about you" (I Pt 5:7; cf. Ps 55:23). 

323 Divine providence works also through the actions of creatures. To 
human beings God grants the ability to co-operate freely with his 
plans. 

324 The fact that God permits physical and even moral evil is a 
mystery that God illuminates by his Son Jesus Christ who died and 
rose to vanquish evil. Faith gives us the certainty that God would not 
permit an evil if he did not cause a good to come from that very evil, 
by ways that we shall fully know only in eternal life.

PART ONE: THE PROFESSION OF FAITH 

 

 

 

SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS 

 

 

 



CHAPTER ONE I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER 

 

 

 

Article 1 "I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY, 
CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH" 

 

 

Paragraph 5. HEAVEN AND EARTH 

325 The Apostles' Creed professes that God is "creator of heaven and 
earth". the Nicene Creed makes it explicit that this profession includes 
"all that is, seen and unseen". 

326 The Scriptural expression "heaven and earth" means all that exists, 
creation in its entirety. It also indicates the bond, deep within creation, 
that both unites heaven and earth and distinguishes the one from the 
other: "the earth" is the world of men, while "heaven" or "the heavens" 
can designate both the firmament and God's own "place" - "our Father 
in heaven" and consequently the "heaven" too which is eschatological 
glory. Finally, "heaven" refers to the saints and the "place" of the 
spiritual creatures, the angels, who surround God.186 

327 The profession of faith of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) 
affirms that God "from the beginning of time made at once (simul) out 
of nothing both orders of creatures, the spiritual and the corporeal, 
that is, the angelic and the earthly, and then (deinde) the human 
creature, who as it were shares in both orders, being composed of spirit 
and body."187 

I. THE ANGELS 

The existence of angels - a truth of faith 

328 The existence of the spiritual, non-corporeal beings that Sacred 
Scripture usually calls "angels" is a truth of faith. the witness of 
Scripture is as clear as the unanimity of Tradition. 



Who are they? 

329 St. Augustine says: "'Angel' is the name of their office, not of their 
nature. If you seek the name of their nature, it is 'spirit'; if you seek the 
name of their office, it is 'angel': from what they are, 'spirit', from what 
they do, 'angel.'"188 With their whole beings the angels are servants 
and messengers of God. Because they "always behold the face of my 
Father who is in heaven" they are the "mighty ones who do his word, 
hearkening to the voice of his word".189 

330 As purely spiritual creatures angels have intelligence and will: they 
are personal and immortal creatures, surpassing in perfection all visible 
creatures, as the splendour of their glory bears witness.190 

Christ "with all his angels" 

331 Christ is the centre of the angelic world. They are his angels: 
"When the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him. 
. "191 They belong to him because they were created through and for 
him: "for in him all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible 
and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or 
authorities - all things were created through him and for him."192 
They belong to him still more because he has made them messengers 
of his saving plan: "Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to 
serve, for the sake of those who are to obtain salvation?"193 

332 Angels have been present since creation and throughout the 
history of salvation, announcing this salvation from afar or near and 
serving the accomplishment of the divine plan: they closed the earthly 
paradise; protected Lot; saved Hagar and her child; stayed Abraham's 
hand; communicated the law by their ministry; led the People of God; 
announced births and callings; and assisted the prophets, just to cite a 
few examples.194 Finally, the angel Gabriel announced the birth of the 
Precursor and that of Jesus himself.195 

333 From the Incarnation to the Ascension, the life of the Word 
incarnate is surrounded by the adoration and service of angels. When 
God "brings the firstborn into the world, he says: 'Let all God's angels 
worship him.'"196 Their song of praise at the birth of Christ has not 
ceased resounding in the Church's praise: "Glory to God in the 
highest!"197 They protect Jesus in his infancy, serve him in the desert, 



strengthen him in his agony in the garden, when he could have been 
saved by them from the hands of his enemies as Israel had been.198 
Again, it is the angels who "evangelize" by proclaiming the Good News 
of Christ's Incarnation and Resurrection.199 They will be present at 
Christ's return, which they will announce, to serve at his 
judgement.200 

The angels in the life of the Church 

334 In the meantime, the whole life of the Church benefits from the 
mysterious and powerful help of angels.201 

335 In her liturgy, the Church joins with the angels to adore the thrice-
holy God. She invokes their assistance (in the funeral liturgy's In 
Paradisum deducant te angeli...["May the angels lead you into 
Paradise. . ."]). Moreover, in the "Cherubic Hymn" of the Byzantine 
Liturgy, she celebrates the memory of certain angels more particularly 
(St. Michael, St. Gabriel, St. Raphael, and the guardian angels). 

336 From the beginning until death, human life is surrounded by their 
watchful care and intercession.202 "Beside each believer stands an 
angel as protector and shepherd leading him to life."203 Already here 
on earth the Christian life shares by faith in the blessed company of 
angels and men united in God. 

II. THE VISIBLE WORLD 

337 God himself created the visible world in all its richness, diversity 
and order. Scripture presents the work of the Creator symbolically as a 
succession of six days of divine "work", concluded by the "rest" of the 
seventh day.204 On the subject of creation, the sacred text teaches the 
truths revealed by God for our salvation,205 permitting us to 
"recognize the inner nature, the value and the ordering of the whole of 
creation to the praise of God."206 

338 Nothing exists that does not owe its existence to God the Creator. 
the world began when God's word drew it out of nothingness; all 
existent beings, all of nature, and all human history are rooted in this 
primordial event, the very genesis by which the world was constituted 
and time begun.207 



339 Each creature possesses its own particular goodness and 
perfection. For each one of the works of the "six days" it is said: "and 
God saw that it was good." "By the very nature of creation, material 
being is endowed with its own stability, truth and excellence, its own 
order and laws."208 Each of the various creatures, willed in its own 
being, reflects in its own way a ray of God's infinite wisdom and 
goodness. Man must therefore respect the particular goodness of every 
creature, to avoid any disordered use of things which would be in 
contempt of the Creator and would bring disastrous consequences for 
human beings and their environment. 

340 God wills the interdependence of creatures. the sun and the moon, 
the cedar and the little flower, the eagle and the sparrow: the spectacle 
of their countless diversities and inequalities tells us that no creature is 
self-sufficient. Creatures exist only in dependence on each other, to 
complete each other, in the service of each other. 

341 The beauty of the universe: the order and harmony of the created 
world results from the diversity of beings and from the relationships 
which exist among them. Man discovers them progressively as the laws 
of nature. They call forth the admiration of scholars. the beauty of 
creation reflects the infinite beauty of the Creator and ought to inspire 
the respect and submission of man's intellect and will. 

342 The hierarchy of creatures is expressed by the order of the "six 
days", from the less perfect to the more perfect. God loves all his 
creatures209 and takes care of each one, even the sparrow. 
Nevertheless, Jesus said: "You are of more value than many sparrows", 
or again: "of how much more value is a man than a sheep!"210 

343 Man is the summit of the Creator's work, as the inspired account 
expresses by clearly distinguishing the creation of man from that of the 
other creatures.211 

344 There is a solidarity among all creatures arising from the fact that 
all have the same Creator and are all ordered to his glory: May you be 
praised, O Lord, in all your creatures, especially brother sun, by whom 
you give us light for the day; he is beautiful, radiating great splendour, 
and offering us a symbol of you, the Most High. . . 



May you be praised, my Lord, for sister water, who is very useful and 
humble, precious and chaste. 

May you be praised, my Lord, for sister earth, our mother, who bears 
and feeds us, and produces the variety of fruits and dappled flowers 
and grasses. . .  

Praise and bless my Lord, give thanks and serve him in all humility.212 

345 The sabbath - the end of the work of the six days. the sacred text 
says that "on the seventh day God finished his work which he had 
done", that the "heavens and the earth were finished", and that God 
"rested" on this day and sanctified and blessed it.213 These inspired 
words are rich in profitable instruction: 

346 In creation God laid a foundation and established laws that remain 
firm, on which the believer can rely with confidence, for they are the 
sign and pledge of the unshakeable faithfulness of God's covenant.214 
For his part man must remain faithful to this foundation, and respect 
the laws which the Creator has written into it. 

347 Creation was fashioned with a view to the sabbath and therefore 
for the worship and adoration of God. Worship is inscribed in the order 
of creation.215 As the rule of St. Benedict says, nothing should take 
precedence over "the work of God", that is, solemn worship.216 This 
indicates the right order of human concerns. 

348 The sabbath is at the heart of Israel's law. To keep the 
commandments is to correspond to the wisdom and the will of God as 
expressed in his work of creation. 

349 The eighth day. But for us a new day has dawned: the day of 
Christ's Resurrection. the seventh day completes the first creation. the 
eighth day begins the new creation. Thus, the work of creation 
culminates in the greater work of redemption. the first creation finds its 
meaning and its summit in the new creation in Christ, the splendour of 
which surpasses that of the first creation.217 

IN BRIEF 

350 Angels are spiritual creatures who glorify God without ceasing and 
who serve his saving plans for other creatures: "The angels work 



together for the benefit of us all" (St. Thomas Aquinas, STh I, 114, 3, 
ad 3). 

351 The angels surround Christ their Lord. They serve him especially 
in the accomplishment of his saving mission to men. 

352 The Church venerates the angels who help her on her earthly 
pilgrimage and protect every human being. 

353 God willed the diversity of his creatures and their own particular 
goodness, their interdependence and their order. He destined all 
material creatures for the good of the human race. Man, and through 
him all creation, is destined for the glory of God. 
 

354 Respect for laws inscribed in creation and the relations which 
derive from the nature of things is a principle of wisdom and a 
foundation for morality.

PART ONE: THE PROFESSION OF FAITH 

 

 

 

SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS 

 

 



 

CHAPTER ONE I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER 

 

 

 

Article 1 "I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY, 
CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH" 

 

 

Paragraph 6. MAN 

355 "God created man in his own image, in the image of God he 
created him, male and female he created them."218 Man occupies a 
unique place in creation: (I) he is "in the image of God"; (II) in his 
own nature he unites the spiritual and material worlds; (III) he is 
created "male and female"; (IV) God established him in his friendship. 

I. "IN THE IMAGE OF GOD" 

356 of all visible creatures only man is "able to know and love his 
creator".219 He is "the only creature on earth that God has willed for 
its own sake",220 and he alone is called to share, by knowledge and 
love, in God's own life. It was for this end that he was created, and this 
is the fundamental reason for his dignity:  

What made you establish man in so great a dignity? Certainly the 
incalculable love by which you have looked on your creature in 
yourself! You are taken with love for her; for by love indeed you created 
her, by love you have given her a being capable of tasting your eternal 
Good.221 

357 Being in the image of God the human individual possesses the 
dignity of a person, who is not just something, but someone. He is 
capable of self-knowledge, of self-possession and of freely giving 
himself and entering into communion with other persons. and he is 
called by grace to a covenant with his Creator, to offer him a response 
of faith and love that no other creature can give in his stead. 



358 God created everything for man,222 but man in turn was created 
to serve and love God and to offer all creation back to him:  

What is it that is about to be created, that enjoys such honour? It is 
man that great and wonderful living creature, more precious in the eyes 
of God than all other creatures! For him the heavens and the earth, the 
sea and all the rest of creation exist. God attached so much importance 
to his salvation that he did not spare his own Son for the sake of man. 
Nor does he ever cease to work, trying every possible means, until he 
has raised man up to himself and made him sit at his right hand.223 

359 "In reality it is only in the mystery of the Word made flesh that the 
mystery of man truly becomes clear."224 

St. Paul tells us that the human race takes its origin from two men: 
Adam and Christ. . . the first man, Adam, he says, became a living 
soul, the last Adam a life-giving spirit. the first Adam was made by the 
last Adam, from whom he also received his soul, to give him life... the 
second Adam stamped his image on the first Adam when he created 
him. That is why he took on himself the role and the name of the first 
Adam, in order that he might not lose what he had made in his own 
image. the first Adam, the last Adam: the first had a beginning, the last 
knows no end. the last Adam is indeed the first; as he himself says: "I 
am the first and the last."225 

360 Because of its common origin the human race forms a unity, for 
"from one ancestor (God) made all nations to inhabit the whole 
earth":226 

O wondrous vision, which makes us contemplate the human race in 
the unity of its origin in God. . . in the unity of its nature, composed 
equally in all men of a material body and a spiritual soul; in the unity 
of its immediate end and its mission in the world; in the unity of its 
dwelling, the earth, whose benefits all men, by right of nature, may use 
to sustain and develop life; in the unity of its supernatural end: God 
himself, to whom all ought to tend; in the unity of the means for 
attaining this end;. . . in the unity of the redemption wrought by Christ 
for all.227 



361 "This law of human solidarity and charity",228 without excluding 
the rich variety of persons, cultures and peoples, assures us that all 
men are truly brethren. 

II. "BODY AND SOUL BUT TRULY ONE" 

362 The human person, created in the image of God, is a being at once 
corporeal and spiritual. the biblical account expresses this reality in 
symbolic language when it affirms that "then the LORD God formed 
man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath 
of life; and man became a living being."229 Man, whole and entire, is 
therefore willed by God. 

363 In Sacred Scripture the term "soul" often refers to human life or 
the entire human person.230 But "soul" also refers to the innermost 
aspect of man, that which is of greatest value in him,231 that by which 
he is most especially in God's image: "soul" signifies the spiritual 
principle in man. 

364 The human body shares in the dignity of "the image of God": it is 
a human body precisely because it is animated by a spiritual soul, and 
it is the whole human person that is intended to become, in the body 
of Christ, a temple of the Spirit:232 

Man, though made of body and soul, is a unity. Through his very 
bodily condition he sums up in himself the elements of the material 
world. Through him they are thus brought to their highest perfection 
and can raise their voice in praise freely given to the Creator. For this 
reason man may not despise his bodily life. Rather he is obliged to 
regard his body as good and to hold it in honour since God has created 
it and will raise it up on the last day 233 

365 The unity of soul and body is so profound that one has to consider 
the soul to be the "form" of the body:234 i.e., it is because of its 
spiritual soul that the body made of matter becomes a living, human 
body; spirit and matter, in man, are not two natures united, but rather 
their union forms a single nature. 

366 The Church teaches that every spiritual soul is created 
immediately by God - it is not "produced" by the parents - and also 
that it is immortal: it does not perish when it separates from the body 



at death, and it will be reunited with the body at the final 
Resurrection.235 

367 Sometimes the soul is distinguished from the spirit: St. Paul for 
instance prays that God may sanctify his people "wholly", with "spirit 
and soul and body" kept sound and blameless at the Lord's 
coming.236 The Church teaches that this distinction does not 
introduce a duality into the soul.237 "Spirit" signifies that from 
creation man is ordered to a supernatural end and that his soul can 
gratuitously be raised beyond all it deserves to communion with 
God.238 

368 The spiritual tradition of the Church also emphasizes the heart, in 
the biblical sense of the depths of one's being, where the person 
decides for or against God.239 

III. "MALE AND FEMALE HE CREATED THEM" 

Equality and difference willed by God 

369 Man and woman have been created, which is to say, willed by 
God: on the one hand, in perfect equality as human persons; on the 
other, in their respective beings as man and woman. "Being man" or 
"being woman" is a reality which is good and willed by God: man and 
woman possess an inalienable dignity which comes to them 
immediately from God their Creator.240 Man and woman are both 
with one and the same dignity "in the image of God". In their "being-
man" and "being-woman", they reflect the Creator's wisdom and 
goodness. 

370 In no way is God in man's image. He is neither man nor woman. 
God is pure spirit in which there is no place for the difference between 
the sexes. But the respective "perfections" of man and woman reflect 
something of the infinite perfection of God: those of a mother and 
those of a father and husband.241 

"Each for the other" - "A unity in two" 

371 God created man and woman together and willed each for the 
other. the Word of God gives us to understand this through various 
features of the sacred text. "It is not good that the man should be 
alone. I will make him a helper fit for him."242 None of the animals 



can be man's partner.243 The woman God "fashions" from the man's 
rib and brings to him elicits on the man's part a cry of wonder, an 
exclamation of love and communion: "This at last is bone of my bones 
and flesh of my flesh."244 Man discovers woman as another "I", 
sharing the same humanity. 

372 Man and woman were made "for each other" - not that God left 
them half-made and incomplete: he created them to be a communion 
of persons, in which each can be "helpmate" to the other, for they are 
equal as persons ("bone of my bones. . .") and complementary as 
masculine and feminine. In marriage God unites them in such a way 
that, by forming "one flesh",245 they can transmit human life: "Be 
fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth."246 By transmitting human life 
to their descendants, man and woman as spouses and parents co-
operate in a unique way in the Creator's work.247 

373 In God's plan man and woman have the vocation of "subduing" 
the earth248 as stewards of God. This sovereignty is not to be an 
arbitrary and destructive domination. God calls man and woman, 
made in the image of the Creator "who loves everything that 
exists",249 to share in his providence toward other creatures; hence 
their responsibility for the world God has entrusted to them. 

IV. MAN IN PARADISE 

374 The first man was not only created good, but was also established 
in friendship with his Creator and in harmony with himself and with 
the creation around him, in a state that would be surpassed only by the 
glory of the new creation in Christ. 

375 The Church, interpreting the symbolism of biblical language in an 
authentic way, in the light of the New Testament and Tradition, teaches 
that our first parents, Adam and Eve, were constituted in an original 
"state of holiness and justice".250 This grace of original holiness was 
"to share in. . .divine life".251 

376 By the radiance of this grace all dimensions of man's life were 
confirmed. As long as he remained in the divine intimacy, man would 
not have to suffer or die.252 The inner harmony of the human person, 
the harmony between man and woman,253 and finally the harmony 



between the first couple and all creation, comprised the state called 
"original justice". 

377 The "mastery" over the world that God offered man from the 
beginning was realized above all within man himself: mastery of self. 
the first man was unimpaired and ordered in his whole being because 
he was free from the triple concupiscence254 that subjugates him to 
the pleasures of the senses, covetousness for earthly goods, and self-
assertion, contrary to the dictates of reason. 

378 The sign of man's familiarity with God is that God places him in 
the garden.255 There he lives "to till it and keep it". Work is not yet a 
burden,256 but rather the collaboration of man and woman with God 
in perfecting the visible creation. 

379 This entire harmony of original justice, foreseen for man in God's 
plan, will be lost by the sin of our first parents. 

IN BRIEF 

380 "Father,. . . you formed man in your own likeness and set him over 
the whole world to serve you, his creator, and to rule over all creatures" 
(Roman Missal, EP IV, 118). 

381 Man is predestined to reproduce the image of God's Son made 
man, the "image of the invisible God" (Col 1:15), so that Christ shall 
be the first-born of a multitude of brothers and sisters (cf Eph 1:3-6; 
Rom 8:29). 

382 "Man, though made of body and soul, is a unity" (GS 14 # 1). the 
doctrine of the faith affirms that the spiritual and immortal soul is 
created immediately by God. 

383 "God did not create man a solitary being. From the beginning, 
"male and female he created them" (Gen 1:27). This partnership of 
man and woman constitutes the first form of communion between 
persons" (GS 12 # 4). 

384 Revelation makes known to us the state of original holiness and 
justice of man and woman before sin: from their friendship with God 
flowed the happiness of their existence in paradise.

PART ONE: THE PROFESSION OF FAITH 

 

 

 

SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS 

 

 

 

CHAPTER ONE I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER 

 

 

 

Article 1 "I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY, 
CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH" 

 

 

Paragraph 7. THE FALL 

385 God is infinitely good and all his works are good. Yet no one can 
escape the experience of suffering or the evils in nature which seem to 
be linked to the limitations proper to creatures: and above all to the 
question of moral evil. Where does evil come from? "I sought whence 
evil comes and there was no solution", said St. Augustine,257 and his 
own painful quest would only be resolved by his conversion to the 
living God. For "the mystery of lawlessness" is clarified only in the light 
of the "mystery of our religion".258 The revelation of divine love in 
Christ manifested at the same time the extent of evil and the 
superabundance of grace.259 We must therefore approach the question 
of the origin of evil by fixing the eyes of our faith on him who alone is 
its conqueror.260 



I. WHERE SIN ABOUNDED, GRACE ABOUNDED ALL THE 
MORE 

The reality of sin 

386 Sin is present in human history; any attempt to ignore it or to give 
this dark reality other names would be futile. To try to understand 
what sin is, one must first recognize the profound relation of man to 
God, for only in this relationship is the evil of sin unmasked in its true 
identity as humanity's rejection of God and opposition to him, even as 
it continues to weigh heavy on human life and history. 

387 Only the light of divine Revelation clarifies the reality of sin and 
particularly of the sin committed at mankind's origins. Without the 
knowledge Revelation gives of God we cannot recognize sin clearly and 
are tempted to explain it as merely a developmental flaw, a 
psychological weakness, a mistake, or the necessary consequence of an 
inadequate social structure, etc. Only in the knowledge of God's plan 
for man can we grasp that sin is an abuse of the freedom that God 
gives to created persons so that they are capable of loving him and 
loving one another. 

Original sin - an essential truth of the faith 

388 With the progress of Revelation, the reality of sin is also 
illuminated. Although to some extent the People of God in the Old 
Testament had tried to understand the pathos of the human condition 
in the light of the history of the fall narrated in Genesis, they could not 
grasp this story's ultimate meaning, which is revealed only in the light 
of the death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ.261 We must know 
Christ as the source of grace in order to know Adam as the source of 
sin. the Spirit-Paraclete, sent by the risen Christ, came to "convict the 
world concerning sin",262 by revealing him who is its Redeemer. 

389 The doctrine of original sin is, so to speak, the "reverse side" of the 
Good News that Jesus is the Saviour of all men, that all need salvation 
and that salvation is offered to all through Christ. the Church, which 
has the mind of Christ,263 knows very well that we cannot tamper 
with the revelation of original sin without undermining the mystery of 
Christ. 



How to read the account of the fall 

390 The account of the fall in Genesis 3 uses figurative language, but 
affirms a primeval event, a deed that took place at the beginning of the 
history of man.264 Revelation gives us the certainty of faith that the 
whole of human history is marked by the original fault freely 
committed by our first parents.265 

II. THE FALL OF THE ANGELS 

391 Behind the disobedient choice of our first parents lurks a seductive 
voice, opposed to God, which makes them fall into death out of 
envy.266 Scripture and the Church's Tradition see in this being a fallen 
angel, called "Satan" or the "devil".267 The Church teaches that Satan 
was at first a good angel, made by God: "The devil and the other 
demons were indeed created naturally good by God, but they became 
evil by their own doing."268 

392 Scripture speaks of a sin of these angels.269 This "fall" consists in 
the free choice of these created spirits, who radically and irrevocably 
rejected God and his reign. We find a reflection of that rebellion in the 
tempter's words to our first parents: "You will be like God."270 The 
devil "has sinned from the beginning"; he is "a liar and the father of 
lies".271 

393 It is the irrevocable character of their choice, and not a defect in 
the infinite divine mercy, that makes the angels' sin unforgivable. 
"There is no repentance for the angels after their fall, just as there is no 
repentance for men after death."272 

394 Scripture witnesses to the disastrous influence of the one Jesus 
calls "a murderer from the beginning", who would even try to divert 
Jesus from the mission received from his Father.273 "The reason the 
Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil."274 In its 
consequences the gravest of these works was the mendacious seduction 
that led man to disobey God. 

395 The power of Satan is, nonetheless, not infinite. He is only a 
creature, powerful from the fact that he is pure spirit, but still a 
creature. He cannot prevent the building up of God's reign. Although 
Satan may act in the world out of hatred for God and his kingdom in 



Christ Jesus, and although his action may cause grave injuries - of a 
spiritual nature and, indirectly, even of a physical nature - to each man 
and to society, the action is permitted by divine providence which with 
strength and gentleness guides human and cosmic history. It is a great 
mystery that providence should permit diabolical activity, but "we 
know that in everything God works for good with those who love 
him."275 

III. ORIGINAL SIN 

Freedom put to the test 

396 God created man in his image and established him in his 
friendship. A spiritual creature, man can live this friendship only in free 
submission to God. the prohibition against eating "of the tree of the 
knowledge of good and evil" spells this out: "for in the day that you eat 
of it, you shall die."276 The "tree of the knowledge of good and 
evil"277 symbolically evokes the insurmountable limits that man, being 
a creature, must freely recognize and respect with trust. Man is 
dependent on his Creator, and subject to the laws of creation and to 
the moral norms that govern the use of freedom. 

Man's first sin 

397 Man, tempted by the devil, let his trust in his Creator die in his 
heart and, abusing his freedom, disobeyed God's command. This is 
what man's first sin consisted of.278 All subsequent sin would be 
disobedience toward God and lack of trust in his goodness. 

398 In that sin man preferred himself to God and by that very act 
scorned him. He chose himself over and against God, against the 
requirements of his creaturely status and therefore against his own 
good. Constituted in a state of holiness, man was destined to be fully 
"divinized" by God in glory. Seduced by the devil, he wanted to "be 
like God", but "without God, before God, and not in accordance with 
God".279 

399 Scripture portrays the tragic consequences of this first 
disobedience. Adam and Eve immediately lose the grace of original 
holiness.280 They become afraid of the God of whom they have 



conceived a distorted image - that of a God jealous of his 
prerogatives.281 

400 The harmony in which they had found themselves, thanks to 
original justice, is now destroyed: the control of the soul's spiritual 
faculties over the body is shattered; the union of man and woman 
becomes subject to tensions, their relations henceforth marked by lust 
and domination.282 Harmony with creation is broken: visible creation 
has become alien and hostile to man.283 Because of man, creation is 
now subject "to its bondage to decay".284 Finally, the consequence 
explicitly foretold for this disobedience will come true: man will 
"return to the ground",285 for out of it he was taken. Death makes its 
entrance into human history.286 

401 After that first sin, the world is virtually inundated by sin There is 
Cain's murder of his brother Abel and the universal corruption which 
follows in the wake of sin. Likewise, sin frequently manifests itself in 
the history of Israel, especially as infidelity to the God of the Covenant 
and as transgression of the Law of Moses. and even after Christ's 
atonement, sin raises its head in countless ways among Christians.287 
Scripture and the Church's Tradition continually recall the presence 
and universality of sin in man's history: 

What Revelation makes known to us is confirmed by our own 
experience. For when man looks into his own heart he finds that he is 
drawn towards what is wrong and sunk in many evils which cannot 
come from his good creator. Often refusing to acknowledge God as his 
source, man has also upset the relationship which should link him to 
his last end, and at the same time he has broken the right order that 
should reign within himself as well as between himself and other men 
and all creatures.288 

The consequences of Adam's sin for humanity 

402 All men are implicated in Adam's sin, as St. Paul affirms: "By one 
man's disobedience many (that is, all men) were made sinners": "sin 
came into the world through one man and death through sin, and so 
death spread to all men because all men sinned."289 The Apostle 
contrasts the universality of sin and death with the universality of 
salvation in Christ. "Then as one man's trespass led to condemnation 



for all men, so one man's act of righteousness leads to acquittal and life 
for all men."290 

403 Following St. Paul, the Church has always taught that the 
overwhelming misery which oppresses men and their inclination 
towards evil and death cannot be understood apart from their 
connection with Adam's sin and the fact that he has transmitted to us a 
sin with which we are all born afflicted, a sin which is the "death of the 
soul".291 Because of this certainty of faith, the Church baptizes for the 
remission of sins even tiny infants who have not committed personal 
sin.292 

404 How did the sin of Adam become the sin of all his descendants? 
the whole human race is in Adam "as one body of one man".293 By 
this "unity of the human race" all men are implicated in Adam's sin, as 
all are implicated in Christ's justice. Still, the transmission of original 
sin is a mystery that we cannot fully understand. But we do know by 
Revelation that Adam had received original holiness and justice not for 
himself alone, but for all human nature. By yielding to the tempter, 
Adam and Eve committed a personal sin, but this sin affected the 
human nature that they would then transmit in a fallen state.294 It is a 
sin which will be transmitted by propagation to all mankind, that is, by 
the transmission of a human nature deprived of original holiness and 
justice. and that is why original sin is called "sin" only in an analogical 
sense: it is a sin "contracted" and not "committed" - a state and not an 
act. 

405 Although it is proper to each individual,295 original sin does not 
have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants. It 
is a deprivation of original holiness and justice, but human nature has 
not been totally corrupted: it is wounded in the natural powers proper 
to it, subject to ignorance, suffering and the dominion of death, and 
inclined to sin - an inclination to evil that is called concupiscence". 
Baptism, by imparting the life of Christ's grace, erases original sin and 
turns a man back towards God, but the consequences for nature, 
weakened and inclined to evil, persist in man and summon him to 
spiritual battle. 

406 The Church's teaching on the transmission of original sin was 
articulated more precisely in the fifth century, especially under the 



impulse of St. Augustine's reflections against Pelagianism, and in the 
sixteenth century, in opposition to the Protestant Reformation. 
Pelagius held that man could, by the natural power of free will and 
without the necessary help of God's grace, lead a morally good life; he 
thus reduced the influence of Adam's fault to bad example. the first 
Protestant reformers, on the contrary, taught that original sin has 
radically perverted man and destroyed his freedom; they identified the 
sin inherited by each man with the tendency to evil (concupiscentia), 
which would be insurmountable. the Church pronounced on the 
meaning of the data of Revelation on original sin especially at the 
second Council of Orange (529)296 and at the Council of Trent 
(1546).297 

A hard battle. . . 

407 The doctrine of original sin, closely connected with that of 
redemption by Christ, provides lucid discernment of man's situation 
and activity in the world. By our first parents' sin, the devil has 
acquired a certain domination over man, even though man remains 
free. Original sin entails "captivity under the power of him who 
thenceforth had the power of death, that is, the devil".298 Ignorance of 
the fact that man has a wounded nature inclined to evil gives rise to 
serious errors in the areas of education, politics, social action299 and 
morals. 

408 The consequences of original sin and of all men's personal sins put 
the world as a whole in the sinful condition aptly described in St. 
John's expression, "the sin of the world".300 This expression can also 
refer to the negative influence exerted on people by communal 
situations and social structures that are the fruit of men's sins.301 

409 This dramatic situation of "the whole world [which] is in the 
power of the evil one"302 makes man's life a battle: 

The whole of man's history has been the story of dour combat with the 
powers of evil, stretching, so our Lord tells us, from the very dawn of 
history until the last day. Finding himself in the midst of the battlefield 
man has to struggle to do what is right, and it is at great cost to 
himself, and aided by God's grace, that he succeeds in achieving his 
own inner integrity.303 



IV. "YOU DID NOT ABANDON HIM TO THE POWER OF 
DEATH" 

410 After his fall, man was not abandoned by God. On the contrary, 
God calls him and in a mysterious way heralds the coming victory over 
evil and his restoration from his fall.304 This passage in Genesis is 
called the Protoevangelium ("first gospel"): the first announcement of 
the Messiah and Redeemer, of a battle between the serpent and the 
Woman, and of the final victory of a descendant of hers. 

411 The Christian tradition sees in this passage an announcement of 
the "New Adam" who, because he "became obedient unto death, even 
death on a cross", makes amends superabundantly for the 
disobedience, of Adam.305 Furthermore many Fathers and Doctors of 
the Church have seen the woman announced in the "Proto-
evangelium" as Mary, the mother of Christ, the "new Eve". Mary 
benefited first of all and uniquely from Christ's victory over sin: she 
was preserved from all stain of original sin and by a special grace of 
God committed no sin of any kind during her whole earthly life.306 

412 But why did God not prevent the first man from sinning? St. Leo 
the Great responds, "Christ's inexpressible grace gave us blessings 
better than those the demon's envy had taken away."307 and St. 
Thomas Aquinas wrote, "There is nothing to prevent human nature's 
being raised up to something greater, even after sin; God permits evil 
in order to draw forth some greater good. Thus St. Paul says, 'Where 
sin increased, grace abounded all the more'; and the Exsultet sings, 'O 
happy fault,. . . which gained for us so great a Redeemer!'"308 

IN BRIEF 

413 "God did not make death, and he does not delight in the death of 
the living. . . It was through the devil's envy that death entered the 
world" (Wis 1:13; 2:24). 

414 Satan or the devil and the other demons are fallen angels who 
have freely refused to serve God and his plan. Their choice against God 
is definitive. They try to associate man in their revolt against God. 

415 "Although set by God in a state of rectitude man, enticed by the 
evil one, abused his freedom at the very start of history. He lifted 



himself up against God, and sought to attain his goal apart from him" 
(GS 13 # 1). 

416 By his sin Adam, as the first man, lost the original holiness and 
justice he had received from God, not only for himself but for all 
human beings. 

417 Adam and Eve transmitted to their descendants human nature 
wounded by their own first sin and hence deprived of original holiness 
and justice; this deprivation is called "original sin". 

418 As a result of original sin, human nature is weakened in its powers, 
subject to ignorance, suffering and the domination of death, and 
inclined to sin (this inclination is called "concupiscence"). 

419 "We therefore hold, with the Council of Trent, that original sin is 
transmitted with human nature, "by propagation, not by imitation" and 
that it is. . . 'proper to each'" (Paul VI, CPG # 16). 

420 The victory that Christ won over sin has given us greater blessings 
than those which sin had taken from us: "where sin increased, grace 
abounded all the more" (Rom 5:20). 

421 Christians believe that "the world has been established and kept in 
being by the Creator's love; has fallen into slavery to sin but has been 
set free by Christ, crucified and risen to break the power of the evil 
one. . ." (GS 2 # 2).

SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS 

 

 

CHAPTER TWO I BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST, THE ONLY SON 
OF GOD 

The Good News: God has sent his Son 

422 'But when the time had fully come, God sent forth his Son, born 
of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the 
law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.'1 This is 'the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, the Son of God':2 God has visited his people. He has 
fulfilled the promise he made to Abraham and his descendants. He 
acted far beyond all expectation - he has sent his own 'beloved Son'.3 

423 We believe and confess that Jesus of Nazareth, born a Jew of a 
daughter of Israel at Bethlehem at the time of King Herod the Great 
and the emperor Caesar Augustus, a carpenter by trade, who died 
crucified in Jerusalem under the procurator Pontius Pilate during the 
reign of the emperor Tiberius, is the eternal Son of God made man. He 
'came from God',4 'descended from heaven',5 and 'came in the flesh'.6 
For 'the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and 
truth; we have beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son from the 
Father. . . and from his fullness have we all received, grace upon 
grace.'7 



424 Moved by the grace of the Holy Spirit and drawn by the Father, 
we believe in Jesus and confess: 'You are the Christ, the Son of the 
living God.'8 On the rock of this faith confessed by St. Peter, Christ 
built his Church.9  

"To preach. . . the unsearchable riches of Christ"10 

425 The transmission of the Christian faith consists primarily in 
proclaiming Jesus Christ in order to lead others to faith in him. From 
the beginning, the first disciples burned with the desire to proclaim 
Christ: "We cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard."11 It 
and they invite people of every era to enter into the joy of their 
communion with Christ: 

That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we 
have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon and touched with 
our hands, concerning the word of life - the life was made manifest, 
and we saw it, and testify to it, and proclaim to you the eternal life 
which was with the Father and was made manifest to us - that which 
we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you may have 
fellowship with us; and our fellowship is with the Father and with his 
Son Jesus Christ. and we are writing this that our joy may be 
complete.12 

At the heart of catechesis: Christ 

426 "At the heart of catechesis we find, in essence, a Person, the 
Person of Jesus of Nazareth, the only Son from the Father. . .who 
suffered and died for us and who now, after rising, is living with us 
forever."13 To catechize is "to reveal in the Person of Christ the whole 
of God's eternal design reaching fulfilment in that Person. It is to seek 
to understand the meaning of Christ's actions and words and of the 
signs worked by him."14 Catechesis aims at putting "people . . . in 
communion . . . with Jesus Christ: only he can lead us to the love of the 
Father in the Spirit and make us share in the life of the Holy 
Trinity."15 

427 In catechesis "Christ, the Incarnate Word and Son of God,. . . is 
taught - everything else is taught with reference to him - and it is 
Christ alone who teaches - anyone else teaches to the extent that he is 
Christ's spokesman, enabling Christ to teach with his lips. . . Every 



catechist should be able to apply to himself the mysterious words of 
Jesus: 'My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.'"16 

428 Whoever is called "to teach Christ" must first seek "the surpassing 
worth of knowing Christ Jesus"; he must suffer "the loss of all things. . 
." in order to "gain Christ and be found in him", and "to know him and 
the power of his resurrection, and (to) share his sufferings, becoming 
like him in his death, that if possible (he) may attain the resurrection 
from the dead".17 

429 From this loving knowledge of Christ springs the desire to 
proclaim him, to "evangelize", and to lead others to the "yes" of faith in 
Jesus Christ. But at the same time the need to know this faith better 
makes itself felt. To this end, following the order of the Creed, Jesus' 
principal titles - "Christ", "Son of God", and "Lord" (article 2) - will be 
presented. the Creed next confesses the chief mysteries of his life - 
those of his Incarnation (article 3), Paschal mystery (articles 4 and 5) 
and glorification (articles 6 and 7).

ARTICLE 2 "AND IN JESUS CHRIST, HIS ONLY SON, OUR 
LORD" 

I. Jesus 

430 Jesus means in Hebrew: "God saves." At the annunciation, the 
angel Gabriel gave him the name Jesus as his proper name, which 
expresses both his identity and his mission.18 Since God alone can 
forgive sins, it is God who, in Jesus his eternal Son made man, "will 
save his people from their sins".19 in Jesus, God recapitulates all of his 
history of salvation on behalf of men. 

431 In the history of salvation God was not content to deliver Israel 
"out of the house of bondage"20 by bringing them out of Egypt. He 
also saves them from their sin. Because sin is always an offence against 
God, only he can forgive it.21 For this reason Israel, becoming more 
and more aware of the universality of sin, will no longer be able to seek 
salvation except by invoking the name of the Redeemer God.22 

432 The name "Jesus" signifies that the very name of God is present in 
the person of his Son, made man for the universal and definitive 
redemption from sins. It is the divine name that alone brings salvation, 
and henceforth all can invoke his name, for Jesus united himself to all 
men through his Incarnation,23 so that "there is no other name under 
heaven given among men by which we must be saved."24 

433 The name of the Saviour God was invoked only once in the year 
by the high priest in atonement for the sins of Israel, after he had 



sprinkled the mercy seat in the Holy of Holies with the sacrificial 
blood. the mercy seat was the place of God's presence.25 When St. 
Paul speaks of Jesus whom "God put forward as an expiation by his 
blood", he means that in Christ's humanity "God was in Christ 
reconciling the world to himself."26 

434 Jesus' Resurrection glorifies the name of the Saviour God, for from 
that time on it is the name of Jesus that fully manifests the supreme 
power of the "name which is above every name".27 The evil spirits fear 
his name; in his name his disciples perform miracles, for the Father 
grants all they ask in this name.28 

435 The name of Jesus is at the heart of Christian prayer. All liturgical 
prayers conclude with the words "through our Lord Jesus Christ". the 
Hail Mary reaches its high point in the words "blessed is the fruit of 
thy womb, Jesus." the Eastern prayer of the heart, the Jesus Prayer, 
says: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner." 
Many Christians, such as St. Joan of Arc, have died with the one word 
"Jesus" on their lips.

II. Christ 

436 The word "Christ" comes from the Greek translation of the 
Hebrew Messiah, which means "anointed". It became the name proper 
to Jesus only because he accomplished perfectly the divine mission that 
"Christ" signifies. In effect, in Israel those consecrated to God for a 
mission that he gave were anointed in his name. This was the case for 



kings, for priests and, in rare instances, for prophets.29 This had to be 
the case all the more so for the Messiah whom God would send to 
inaugurate his kingdom definitively.30 It was necessary that the 
Messiah be anointed by the Spirit of the Lord at once as king and 
priest, and also as prophet.31 Jesus fulfilled the messianic hope of 
Israel in his threefold office of priest, prophet and king. 

437 To the shepherds, the angel announced the birth of Jesus as the 
Messiah promised to Israel: "To you is born this day in the city of 
David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord."32 From the beginning he 
was "the one whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world", 
conceived as "holy" in Mary's virginal womb.33 God called Joseph to 
"take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the 
Holy Spirit", so that Jesus, "who is called Christ", should be born of 
Joseph's spouse into the messianic lineage of David.34 

438 Jesus' messianic consecration reveals his divine mission, "for the 
name 'Christ' implies 'he who anointed', 'he who was anointed' and 'the 
very anointing with which he was anointed'. the one who anointed is 
the Father, the one who was anointed is the Son, and he was anointed 
with the Spirit who is the anointing.'"35 His eternal messianic 
consecration was revealed during the time of his earthly life at the 
moment of his baptism by John, when "God anointed Jesus of 
Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power", "that he might be 
revealed to Israel"36 as its Messiah. His works and words will manifest 
him as "the Holy One of God".37 

439 Many Jews and even certain Gentiles who shared their hope 
recognized in Jesus the fundamental attributes of the messianic "Son of 
David", promised by God to Israel.38 Jesus accepted his rightful title 
of Messiah, though with some reserve because it was understood by 
some of his contemporaries in too human a sense, as essentially 
political.39 

440 Jesus accepted Peter's profession of faith, which acknowledged him 
to be the Messiah, by announcing the imminent Passion of the Son of 
Man.40 He unveiled the authentic content of his messianic kingship 
both in the transcendent identity of the Son of Man "who came down 
from heaven", and in his redemptive mission as the suffering Servant: 
"The Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his 



life as a ransom for many."41 Hence the true meaning of his kingship 
is revealed only when he is raised high on the cross.42 Only after his 
Resurrection will Peter be able to proclaim Jesus' messianic kingship to 
the People of God: "Let all the house of Israel therefore know 
assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus 
whom you crucified."43

III. The Only Son of God 

441 In the Old Testament, "son of God" is a title given to the angels, 
the Chosen People, the children of Israel, and their kings.44 It signifies 
an adoptive sonship that establishes a relationship of particular 
intimacy between God and his creature. When the promised Messiah-
King is called "son of God", it does not necessarily imply that he was 
more than human, according to the literal meaning of these texts. 
Those who called Jesus "son of God", as the Messiah of Israel, perhaps 
meant nothing more than this.45 

442 Such is not the case for Simon Peter when he confesses Jesus as 
"the Christ, the Son of the living God", for Jesus responds solemnly: 
"Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in 
heaven."46 Similarly Paul will write, regarding his conversion on the 
road to Damascus, "When he who had set me apart before I was born, 
and had called me through his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son to 
me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles..."47 "and in 
the synagogues immediately [Paul] proclaimed Jesus, saying, 'He is the 
Son of God.'"48 From the beginning this acknowledgment of Christ's 
divine sonship will be the centre of the apostolic faith, first professed 
by Peter as the Church's foundation.49 

443 Peter could recognize the transcendent character of the Messiah's 
divine sonship because Jesus had clearly allowed it to be so 
understood. To his accusers' question before the Sanhedrin, "Are you 
the Son of God, then?" Jesus answered, "You say that I am."50 Well 
before this, Jesus referred to himself as "the Son" who knows the 
Father, as distinct from the "servants" God had earlier sent to his 
people; he is superior even to the angels.51 He distinguished his 
sonship from that of his disciples by never saying "our Father", except 
to command them: "You, then, pray like this: 'Our Father'", and he 
emphasized this distinction, saying "my Father and your Father".52 

444 The Gospels report that at two solemn moments, the Baptism and 
the Transfiguration of Christ, the voice of the Father designates Jesus 
his "beloved Son".53 Jesus calls himself the "only Son of God", and by 
this title affirms his eternal pre-existence.54 He asks for faith in "the 
name of the only Son of God".55 In the centurion's exclamation before 
the crucified Christ, "Truly this man was the Son of God",56 that 



Christian confession is already heard. Only in the Paschal mystery can 
the believer give the title "Son of God" its full meaning. 

445 After his Resurrection, Jesus' divine sonship becomes manifest in 
the power of his glorified humanity. He was "designated Son of God in 
power according to the Spirit of holiness by his Resurrection from the 
dead".57 The apostles can confess: "We have beheld his glory, glory as 
of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth."58

IV. Lord 

446 In the Greek translation of the Old Testament, the ineffable 
Hebrew name YHWH, by which God revealed himself to Moses,59 is 
rendered as Kyrios, "Lord". From then on, "Lord" becomes the more 
usual name by which to indicate the divinity of Israel's God. the New 
Testament uses this full sense of the title "Lord" both for the Father 
and - what is new - for Jesus, who is thereby recognized as God 
Himself.60 

447 Jesus ascribes this title to himself in a veiled way when he disputes 
with the Pharisees about the meaning of Psalm 110, but also in an 
explicit way when he addresses his apostles.61 Throughout his public 
life, he demonstrated his divine sovereignty by works of power over 
nature, illnesses, demons, death and sin. 

448 Very often in the Gospels people address Jesus as "Lord". This title 
testifies to the respect and trust of those who approach him for help 
and healing.62 At the prompting of the Holy Spirit, "Lord" expresses 
the recognition of the divine mystery of Jesus.63 In the encounter with 
the risen Jesus, this title becomes adoration: "My Lord and my God!" 
It thus takes on a connotation of love and affection that remains proper 
to the Christian tradition: "It is the Lord!"64 

449 By attributing to Jesus the divine title "Lord", the first confessions 
of the Church's faith affirm from the beginning that the power, honour 
and glory due to God the Father are due also to Jesus, because "he was 
in the form of God",65 and the Father manifested the sovereignty of 
Jesus by raising him from the dead and exalting him into his glory.66 

450 From the beginning of Christian history, the assertion of Christ's 
lordship over the world and over history has implicitly recognized that 
man should not submit his personal freedom in an absolute manner to 
any earthly power, but only to God the Father and the Lord Jesus 
Christ: Caesar is not "the Lord".67 "The Church. . . believes that the 
key, the centre and the purpose of the whole of man's history is to be 
found in its Lord and Master."68 



451 Christian prayer is characterized by the title "Lord", whether in 
the invitation to prayer ("The Lord be with you"), its conclusion 
("through Christ our Lord") or the exclamation full of trust and hope: 
Maranatha ("Our Lord, come!") or Maranatha ("Come, Lord!") - 
"Amen Come Lord Jesus!"69

IN BRIEF 

452 The name Jesus means "God saves". the child born of the Virgin 
Mary is called Jesus, "for he will save his people from their sins" (Mt 
1:21): "there is no other name under heaven given among men by 
which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12). 

453 The title "Christ" means "Anointed One" (Messiah).Jesus is the 
Christ, for "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and 
with power" (Acts 10:38). He was the one "who is to come" (Lk 7:19), 
the object of "the hope of Israel" (Acts 28:20). 

454 The title "Son of God" signifies the unique and eternal 
relationship of Jesus Christ to God his Father: he is the only Son of the 
Father (cf Jn 1:14, 18; 3:16, 18); he is God himself (cf Jn 1:1). To be a 
Christian, one must believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God (cf Acts 
8:37; 1 Jn 2:23). 

455 The title "Lord" indicates divine sovereignty. To confess or invoke 
Jesus as Lord is to believe in his divinity. "No one can say 'Jesus is 
Lord' except by the Holy Spirit'" (I Cor 12:3).

Article 3 "HE WAS CONCEIVED BY THE POWER OF THE HOLY 
SPIRIT, AND WAS BORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY" 

Paragraph 1. THE SON OF GOD BECAME MAN 

I. WHY DID THE WORD BECOME FLESH? 



456 With the Nicene Creed, we answer by confessing: "For us men and 
for our salvation he came down from heaven; by the power of the Holy 
Spirit, he became incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and was made man." 

457 The Word became flesh for us in order to save us by reconciling us 
with God, who "loved us and sent his Son to be the expiation for our 
sins": "the Father has sent his Son as the Saviour of the world", and "he 
was revealed to take away sins":70 

Sick, our nature demanded to be healed; fallen, to be raised up; dead, 
to rise again. We had lost the possession of the good; it was necessary 
for it to be given back to us. Closed in the darkness, it was necessary to 
bring us the light; captives, we awaited a Saviour; prisoners, help; 
slaves, a liberator. Are these things minor or insignificant? Did they not 
move God to descend to human nature and visit it, since humanity was 
in so miserable and unhappy a state?71 

458 The Word became flesh so that thus we might know God's love: "In 
this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his 
only Son into the world, so that we might live through him."72 "For 
God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever 
believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."73 

459 The Word became flesh to be our model of holiness: "Take my 
yoke upon you, and learn from me." "I am the way, and the truth, and 
the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me."74 On the mountain 
of the Transfiguration, the Father commands: "Listen to him!"75 Jesus 
is the model for the Beatitudes and the norm of the new law: "Love 
one another as I have loved you."76 This love implies an effective 
offering of oneself, after his example.77 

460 The Word became flesh to make us "partakers of the divine 
nature":78 "For this is why the Word became man, and the Son of God 
became the Son of man: so that man, by entering into communion 
with the Word and thus receiving divine sonship, might become a son 
of God."79 "For the Son of God became man so that we might 
become God."80 "The only-begotten Son of God, wanting to make us 
sharers in his divinity, assumed our nature, so that he, made man, 
might make men gods."81 

II. THE INCARNATION 



461 Taking up St. John's expression, "The Word became flesh",82 The 
Church calls "Incarnation" the fact that the Son of God assumed a 
human nature in order to accomplish our salvation in it. In a hymn 
cited by St. Paul, the Church sings the mystery of the Incarnation: 

Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, 
though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a 
thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, 
being born in the likeness of men. and being found in human form he 
humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a 
cross.83 

462 The Letter to the Hebrews refers to the same mystery: 

Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, "Sacrifices 
and offerings you have not desired, but a body have you prepared for 
me; in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure. 
Then I said, Lo, I have come to do your will, O God."84 

463 Belief in the true Incarnation of the Son of God is the distinctive 
sign of Christian faith: "By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit 
which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God."85 
Such is the joyous conviction of the Church from her beginning 
whenever she sings "the mystery of our religion": "He was manifested 
in the flesh."86 

III. TRUE GOD AND TRUE MAN 

464 The unique and altogether singular event of the Incarnation of the 
Son of God does not mean that Jesus Christ is part God and part man, 
nor does it imply that he is the result of a confused mixture of the 
divine and the human. He became truly man while remaining truly 
God. Jesus Christ is true God and true man.  

During the first centuries, the Church had to defend and clarify this 
truth of faith against the heresies that falsified it. 

465 The first heresies denied not so much Christ's divinity as his true 
humanity (Gnostic Docetism). From apostolic times the Christian 
faith has insisted on the true incarnation of God's Son "come in the 
flesh".87 But already in the third century, the Church in a council at 
Antioch had to affirm against Paul of Samosata that Jesus Christ is Son 



of God by nature and not by adoption. the first ecumenical council of 
Nicaea in 325 confessed in its Creed that the Son of God is "begotten, 
not made, of the same substance (homoousios) as the Father", and 
condemned Arius, who had affirmed that the Son of God "came to be 
from things that were not" and that he was "from another substance" 
than that of the Father.88 

466 The Nestorian heresy regarded Christ as a human person joined to 
the divine person of God's Son. Opposing this heresy, St. Cyril of 
Alexandria and the third ecumenical council, at Ephesus in 431, 
confessed "that the Word, uniting to himself in his person the flesh 
animated by a rational soul, became man."89 Christ's humanity has no 
other subject than the divine person of the Son of God, who assumed 
it and made it his own, from his conception. For this reason the 
Council of Ephesus proclaimed in 431 that Mary truly became the 
Mother of God by the human conception of the Son of God in her 
womb: "Mother of God, not that the nature of the Word or his divinity 
received the beginning of its existence from the holy Virgin, but that, 
since the holy body, animated by a rational soul, which the Word of 
God united to himself according to the hypostasis, was born from her, 
the Word is said to be born according to the flesh."90 

467 The Monophysites affirmed that the human nature had ceased to 
exist as such in Christ when the divine person of God's Son assumed 
it. Faced with this heresy, the fourth ecumenical council, at Chalcedon 
in 451, confessed:  

Following the holy Fathers, we unanimously teach and confess one and 
the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ: the same perfect in divinity and 
perfect in humanity, the same truly God and truly man, composed of 
rational soul and body; consubstantial with the Father as to his divinity 
and consubstantial with us as to his humanity; "like us in all things but 
sin". He was begotten from the Father before all ages as to his divinity 
and in these last days, for us and for our salvation, was born as to his 
humanity of the virgin Mary, the Mother of God.91 

  

We confess that one and the same Christ, Lord, and only-begotten 
Son, is to be acknowledged in two natures without confusion, change, 



division or separation. the distinction between the natures was never 
abolished by their union, but rather the character proper to each of the 
two natures was preserved as they came together in one person 
(prosopon) and one hypostasis.92 

468 After the Council of Chalcedon, some made of Christ's human 
nature a kind of personal subject. Against them, the fifth ecumenical 
council, at Constantinople in 553, confessed that "there is but one 
hypostasis [or person], which is our Lord Jesus Christ, one of the 
Trinity."93 Thus everything in Christ's human nature is to be 
attributed to his divine person as its proper subject, not only his 
miracles but also his sufferings and even his death: "He who was 
crucified in the flesh, our Lord Jesus Christ, is true God, Lord of glory, 
and one of the Holy Trinity."94 

469 The Church thus confesses that Jesus is inseparably true God and 
true man. He is truly the Son of God who, without ceasing to be God 
and Lord, became a man and our brother: "What he was, he remained 
and what he was not, he assumed", sings the Roman Liturgy.95 and 
the liturgy of St. John Chrysostom proclaims and sings: "O only-
begotten Son and Word of God, immortal being, you who deigned for 
our salvation to become incarnate of the holy Mother of God and ever-
virgin Mary, you who without change became man and were crucified, 
O Christ our God, you who by your death have crushed death, you 
who are one of the Holy Trinity, glorified with the Father and the Holy 
Spirit, save us!"96 

IV. HOW IS THE SON OF GOD MAN? 

470 Because "human nature was assumed, not absorbed",97 in the 
mysterious union of the Incarnation, the Church was led over the 
course of centuries to confess the full reality of Christ's human soul, 
with its operations of intellect and will, and of his human body. In 
parallel fashion, she had to recall on each occasion that Christ's human 
nature belongs, as his own, to the divine person of the Son of God, 
who assumed it. Everything that Christ is and does in this nature 
derives from "one of the Trinity". 



The Son of God therefore communicates to his humanity his own 
personal mode of existence in the Trinity. In his soul as in his body, 
Christ thus expresses humanly the divine ways of the Trinity:98 

The Son of God. . . worked with human hands; he thought with a 
human mind. He acted with a human will, and with a human heart he 
loved. Born of the Virgin Mary, he has truly been made one of us, like 
to us in all things except sin.99 

Christ's soul and his human knowledge 

471 Apollinarius of Laodicaea asserted that in Christ the divine Word 
had replaced the soul or spirit. Against this error the Church confessed 
that the eternal Son also assumed a rational, human soul.100 

472 This human soul that the Son of God assumed is endowed with a 
true human knowledge. As such, this knowledge could not in itself be 
unlimited: it was exercised in the historical conditions of his existence 
in space and time. This is why the Son of God could, when he became 
man, "increase in wisdom and in stature, and in favour with God and 
man",101 and would even have to inquire for himself about what one 
in the human condition can learn only from experience.102 This 
corresponded to the reality of his voluntary emptying of himself, taking 
"the form of a slave".103 

473 But at the same time, this truly human knowledge of God's Son 
expressed the divine life of his person.104 "The human nature of 
God's Son, not by itself but by its union with the Word, knew and 
showed forth in itself everything that pertains to God."105 Such is first 
of all the case with the intimate and immediate knowledge that the Son 
of God made man has of his Father.106 The Son in his human 
knowledge also showed the divine penetration he had into the secret 
thoughts of human hearts.107 

474 By its union to the divine wisdom in the person of the Word 
incarnate, Christ enjoyed in his human knowledge the fullness of 
understanding of the eternal plans he had come to reveal.108 What he 
admitted to not knowing in this area, he elsewhere declared himself not 
sent to reveal.109 

Christ's human will 



475 Similarly, at the sixth ecumenical council, Constantinople III in 
681, the Church confessed that Christ possesses two wills and two 
natural operations, divine and human. They are not opposed to each 
other, but co-operate in such a way that the Word made flesh willed 
humanly in obedience to his Father all that he had decided divinely 
with the Father and the Holy Spirit for our salvation.110 Christ's 
human will "does not resist or oppose but rather submits to his divine 
and almighty will."111 

Christ's true body 

476 Since the Word became flesh in assuming a true humanity, Christ's 
body was finite.112 Therefore the human face of Jesus can be 
portrayed; at the seventh ecumenical council (Nicaea II in 787) the 
Church recognized its representation in holy images to be 
legitimate.113 

477 At the same time the Church has always acknowledged that in the 
body of Jesus "we see our God made visible and so are caught up in 
love of the God we cannot see."114 The individual characteristics of 
Christ's body express the divine person of God's Son. He has made the 
features of his human body his own, to the point that they can be 
venerated when portrayed in a holy image, for the believer "who 
venerates the icon is venerating in it the person of the one 
depicted".115 

The heart of the Incarnate Word 

478 Jesus knew and loved us each and all during his life, his agony and 
his Passion, and gave himself up for each one of us: "The Son of God. . 
. loved me and gave himself for me."116 He has loved us all with a 
human heart. For this reason, the Sacred Heart of Jesus, pierced by 
our sins and for our salvation,117 "is quite rightly considered the chief 
sign and symbol of that. . . love with which the divine Redeemer 
continually loves the eternal Father and all human beings" without 
exception.118 

IN BRIEF 

479 At the time appointed by God, the only Son of the Father, the 
eternal Word, that is, the Word and substantial Image of the Father, 



became incarnate; without losing his divine nature he has assumed 
human nature. 

480 Jesus Christ is true God and true man, in the unity of his divine 
person; for this reason he is the one and only mediator between God 
and men. 

481 Jesus Christ possesses two natures, one divine and the other 
human, not confused, but united in the one person of God's Son. 

482 Christ, being true God and true man, has a human intellect and 
will, perfectly attuned and subject to his divine intellect and divine will, 
which he has in common with the Father and the Holy Spirit. 

483 The Incarnation is therefore the mystery of the wonderful union of 
the divine and human natures in the one person of the Word.

CHAPTER TWO I BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST, THE ONLY SON 
OF GOD 



 

 

 

Article 3 "HE WAS CONCEIVED BY THE POWER OF THE HOLY 
SPIRIT, AND WAS BORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY" 

 

 

Paragraph 2. "CONCEIVED BY THE POWER OF THE HOLY 
SPIRIT AND BORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY" 

I. CONCEIVED BY THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. . . 

484 The Annunciation to Mary inaugurates "the fullness of time",119 
The time of the fulfilment of God's promises and preparations. Mary 
was invited to conceive him in whom the "whole fullness of deity" 
would dwell "bodily".120 The divine response to her question, "How 
can this be, since I know not man?", was given by the power of the 
Spirit: "The Holy Spirit will come upon you."121 

485 The mission of the Holy Spirit is always conjoined and ordered to 
that of the Son.122 The Holy Spirit, "the Lord, the giver of Life", is 
sent to sanctify the womb of the Virgin Mary and divinely fecundate it, 
causing her to conceive the eternal Son of the Father in a humanity 
drawn from her own. 

486 The Father's only Son, conceived as man in the womb of the 
Virgin Mary, is "Christ", that is to say, anointed by the Holy Spirit, 
from the beginning of his human existence, though the manifestation 
of this fact takes place only progressively: to the shepherds, to the 
magi, to John the Baptist, to the disciples.123 Thus the whole life of 
Jesus Christ will make manifest "how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth 
with the Holy Spirit and with power."124 

II.... BORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY 

487 What the Catholic faith believes about Mary is based on what it 
believes about Christ, and what it teaches about Mary illumines in 
turn its faith in Christ. 



Mary's predestination 

488 "God sent forth his Son", but to prepare a body for him,125 he 
wanted the free co-operation of a creature. For this, from all eternity 
God chose for the mother of his Son a daughter of Israel, a young 
Jewish woman of Nazareth in Galilee, "a virgin betrothed to a man 
whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name 
was Mary":126 

The Father of mercies willed that the Incarnation should be preceded 
by assent on the part of the predestined mother, so that just as a 
woman had a share in the coming of death, so also should a woman 
contribute to the coming of life.127 

489 Throughout the Old Covenant the mission of many holy women 
prepared for that of Mary. At the very beginning there was Eve; despite 
her disobedience, she receives the promise of a posterity that will be 
victorious over the evil one, as well as the promise that she will be the 
mother of all the living.128 By virtue of this promise, Sarah conceives 
a son in spite of her old age.129 Against all human expectation God 
chooses those who were considered powerless and weak to show forth 
his faithfulness to his promises: Hannah, the mother of Samuel; 
Deborah; Ruth; Judith and Esther; and many other women.130 Mary 
"stands out among the poor and humble of the Lord, who confidently 
hope for and receive salvation from him. After a long period of waiting 
the times are fulfilled in her, the exalted Daughter of Sion, and the new 
plan of salvation is established."131 

The Immaculate Conception 

490 To become the mother of the Saviour, Mary "was enriched by God 
with gifts appropriate to such a role."132 The angel Gabriel at the 
moment of the annunciation salutes her as "full of grace".133 In fact, 
in order for Mary to be able to give the free assent of her faith to the 
announcement of her vocation, it was necessary that she be wholly 
borne by God's grace. 

491 Through the centuries the Church has become ever more aware 
that Mary, "full of grace" through God,134 was redeemed from the 
moment of her conception. That is what the dogma of the Immaculate 
Conception confesses, as Pope Pius IX proclaimed in 1854: 



The most Blessed Virgin Mary was, from the first moment of her 
conception, by a singular grace and privilege of almighty God and by 
virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ, Saviour of the human race, 
preserved immune from all stain of original sin.135 

492 The "splendour of an entirely unique holiness" by which Mary is 
"enriched from the first instant of her conception" comes wholly from 
Christ: she is "redeemed, in a more exalted fashion, by reason of the 
merits of her Son".136 The Father blessed Mary more than any other 
created person "in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly 
places" and chose her "in Christ before the foundation of the world, to 
be holy and blameless before him in love".137 

493 The Fathers of the Eastern tradition call the Mother of God "the 
All-Holy" (Panagia), and celebrate her as "free from any stain of sin, as 
though fashioned by the Holy Spirit and formed as a new 
creature".138 By the grace of God Mary remained free of every 
personal sin her whole life long.  

"Let it be done to me according to your word. . ." 

494 At the announcement that she would give birth to "the Son of the 
Most High" without knowing man, by the power of the Holy Spirit, 
Mary responded with the obedience of faith, certain that "with God 
nothing will be impossible": "Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; 
let it be [done] to me according to your word."139 Thus, giving her 
consent to God's word, Mary becomes the mother of Jesus. Espousing 
the divine will for salvation wholeheartedly, without a single sin to 
restrain her, she gave herself entirely to the person and to the work of 
her Son; she did so in order to serve the mystery of redemption with 
him and dependent on him, by God's grace:140 

As St. Irenaeus says, "Being obedient she became the cause of salvation 
for herself and for the whole human race."141 Hence not a few of the 
early Fathers gladly assert. . .: "The knot of Eve's disobedience was 
untied by Mary's obedience: what the virgin Eve bound through her 
disbelief, Mary loosened by her faith."142 Comparing her with Eve, 
they call Mary "the Mother of the living" and frequently claim: "Death 
through Eve, life through Mary."143 

Mary's divine motherhood 



495 Called in the Gospels "the mother of Jesus", Mary is acclaimed by 
Elizabeth, at the prompting of the Spirit and even before the birth of 
her son, as "the mother of my Lord".144 In fact, the One whom she 
conceived as man by the Holy Spirit, who truly became her Son 
according to the flesh, was none other than the Father's eternal Son, 
the second person of the Holy Trinity. Hence the Church confesses 
that Mary is truly "Mother of God" (Theotokos).145 

Mary's virginity 

496 From the first formulations of her faith, the Church has confessed 
that Jesus was conceived solely by the power of the Holy Spirit in the 
womb of the Virgin Mary, affirming also the corporeal aspect of this 
event: Jesus was conceived "by the Holy Spirit without human 
seed".146 The Fathers see in the virginal conception the sign that it 
truly was the Son of God who came in a humanity like our own. Thus 
St. Ignatius of Antioch at the beginning of the second century says:  

You are firmly convinced about our Lord, who is truly of the race of 
David according to the flesh, Son of God according to the will and 
power of God, truly born of a virgin,. . . he was truly nailed to a tree 
for us in his flesh under Pontius Pilate. . . he truly suffered, as he is also 
truly risen.147 

497 The Gospel accounts understand the virginal conception of Jesus 
as a divine work that surpasses all human understanding and 
possibility:148 "That which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit", 
said the angel to Joseph about Mary his fiancee.149 The Church sees 
here the fulfilment of the divine promise given through the prophet 
Isaiah: "Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son."150 

498 People are sometimes troubled by the silence of St. Mark's Gospel 
and the New Testament Epistles about Jesus' virginal conception. Some 
might wonder if we were merely dealing with legends or theological 
constructs not claiming to be history. To this we must respond: Faith in 
the virginal conception of Jesus met with the lively opposition, 
mockery or incomprehension of non-believers, Jews and pagans 
alike;151 so it could hardly have been motivated by pagan mythology 
or by some adaptation to the ideas of the age. the meaning of this event 
is accessible only to faith, which understands in it the "connection of 



these mysteries with one another"152 in the totality of Christ's 
mysteries, from his Incarnation to his Passover. St. Ignatius of Antioch 
already bears witness to this connection: "Mary's virginity and giving 
birth, and even the Lord's death escaped the notice of the prince of this 
world: these three mysteries worthy of proclamation were 
accomplished in God's silence."153 

Mary - "ever-virgin" 

499 The deepening of faith in the virginal motherhood led the Church 
to confess Mary's real and perpetual virginity even in the act of giving 
birth to the Son of God made man.154 In fact, Christ's birth "did not 
diminish his mother's virginal integrity but sanctified it."155 and so the 
liturgy of the Church celebrates Mary as Aeiparthenos, the "Ever-
virgin".156 

500 Against this doctrine the objection is sometimes raised that the 
Bible mentions brothers and sisters of Jesus.157 The Church has 
always understood these passages as not referring to other children of 
the Virgin Mary. In fact James and Joseph, "brothers of Jesus", are the 
sons of another Mary, a disciple of Christ, whom St. Matthew 
significantly calls "the other Mary".158 They are close relations of 
Jesus, according to an Old Testament expression.159 

501 Jesus is Mary's only son, but her spiritual motherhood extends to 
all men whom indeed he came to save: "The Son whom she brought 
forth is he whom God placed as the first-born among many brethren, 
that is, the faithful in whose generation and formation she co-operates 
with a mother's love."160 

Mary's virginal motherhood in God's plan 

502 The eyes of faith can discover in the context of the whole of 
Revelation the mysterious reasons why God in his saving plan wanted 
his Son to be born of a virgin. These reasons touch both on the person 
of Christ and his redemptive mission, and on the welcome Mary gave 
that mission on behalf of all men. 

503 Mary's virginity manifests God's absolute initiative in the 
Incarnation. Jesus has only God as Father. "He was never estranged 
from the Father because of the human nature which he assumed. . . He 



is naturally Son of the Father as to his divinity and naturally son of his 
mother as to his humanity, but properly Son of the Father in both 
natures."161 

504 Jesus is conceived by the Holy Spirit in the Virgin Mary's womb 
because he is the New Adam, who inaugurates the new creation: "The 
first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from 
heaven."162 From his conception, Christ's humanity is filled with the 
Holy Spirit, for God "gives him the Spirit without measure."163 From 
"his fullness" as the head of redeemed humanity "we have all received, 
grace upon grace."164 

505 By his virginal conception, Jesus, the New Adam, ushers in the 
new birth of children adopted in the Holy Spirit through faith. "How 
can this be?"165 Participation in the divine life arises "not of blood nor 
of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God".166 The 
acceptance of this life is virginal because it is entirely the Spirit's gift to 
man. the spousal character of the human vocation in relation to 
God167 is fulfilled perfectly in Mary's virginal motherhood. 

506 Mary is a virgin because her virginity is the sign of her faith 
"unadulterated by any doubt", and of her undivided gift of herself to 
God's will.168 It is her faith that enables her to become the mother of 
the Saviour: "Mary is more blessed because she embraces faith in 
Christ than because she conceives the flesh of Christ."169 

507 At once virgin and mother, Mary is the symbol and the most 
perfect realization of the Church: "the Church indeed. . . by receiving 
the word of God in faith becomes herself a mother. By preaching and 
Baptism she brings forth sons, who are conceived by the Holy Spirit 
and born of God, to a new and immortal life. She herself is a virgin, 
who keeps in its entirety and purity the faith she pledged to her 
spouse."170 

IN BRIEF 

508 From among the descendants of Eve, God chose the Virgin Mary 
to be the mother of his Son. "Full of grace", Mary is "the most 
excellent fruit of redemption" (SC 103): from the first instant of her 
conception, she was totally preserved from the stain of original sin and 
she remained pure from all personal sin throughout her life. 



509 Mary is truly "Mother of God" since she is the mother of the 
eternal Son of God made man, who is God himself. 

510 Mary "remained a virgin in conceiving her Son, a virgin in giving 
birth to him, a virgin in carrying him, a virgin in nursing him at her 
breast, always a virgin" (St. Augustine, Serm. 186, 1: PL 38, 999): with 
her whole being she is "the handmaid of the Lord" (Lk 1:38). 

511 The Virgin Mary "co-operated through free faith and obedience in 
human salvation" (LG 56). She uttered her yes "in the name of all 
human nature" (St. Thomas Aquinas, S Th III, 30, 1). By her 
obedience she became the new Eve, mother of the living.

Article 3 "HE WAS CONCEIVED BY THE POWER OF THE HOLY 
SPIRIT, AND WAS BORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY" 

 

 

Paragraph 3. THE MYSTERIES OF CHRIST'S LIFE 

512 Concerning Christ's life the Creed speaks only about the mysteries 
of the Incarnation (conception and birth) and Paschal mystery 
(passion, crucifixion, death, burial, descent into hell, resurrection and 
ascension). It says nothing explicitly about the mysteries of Jesus' 
hidden or public life, but the articles of faith concerning his 
Incarnation and Passover do shed light on the whole of his earthly life. 
"All that Jesus did and taught, from the beginning until the day when 
he was taken up to heaven",171 is to be seen in the light of the 
mysteries of Christmas and Easter. 

513 According to circumstances catechesis will make use of all the 
richness of the mysteries of Jesus. Here it is enough merely to indicate 
some elements common to all the mysteries of Christ's life (I), in order 
then to sketch the principal mysteries of Jesus' hidden (II) and public 
(III) life. 

I. CHRIST'S WHOLE LIFE IS MYSTERY 



514 Many things about Jesus of interest to human curiosity do not 
figure in the Gospels. Almost nothing is said about his hidden life at 
Nazareth, and even a great part of his public life is not recounted.172 
What is written in the Gospels was set down there "so that you may 
believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you 
may have life in his name."173 

515 The Gospels were written by men who were among the first to 
have the faith174 and wanted to share it with others. Having known in 
faith who Jesus is, they could see and make others see the traces of his 
mystery in all his earthly life. From the swaddling clothes of his birth 
to the vinegar of his Passion and the shroud of his Resurrection, 
everything in Jesus' life was a sign of his mystery.175 His deeds, 
miracles and words all revealed that "in him the whole fullness of deity 
dwells bodily."176 His humanity appeared as "sacrament", that is, the 
sign and instrument, of his divinity and of the salvation he brings: what 
was visible in his earthly life leads to the invisible mystery of his divine 
sonship and redemptive mission 

Characteristics common to Jesus' mysteries 

516 Christ's whole earthly life - his words and deeds, his silences and 
sufferings, indeed his manner of being and speaking - is Revelation of 
the Father. Jesus can say: "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father", 
and the Father can say: "This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to 
him!"177 Because our Lord became man in order to do his Father's 
will, even the least characteristics of his mysteries manifest "God's love. 
. . among us".178 

517 Christ's whole life is a mystery of redemption. Redemption comes 
to us above all through the blood of his cross,179 but this mystery is at 
work throughout Christ's entire life: -already in his Incarnation 
through which by becoming poor he enriches us with his poverty;180 - 
in his hidden life which by his submission atones for our 
disobedience;181 - in his word which purifies its hearers;182- in his 
healings and exorcisms by which "he took our infirmities and bore our 
diseases";183 - and in his Resurrection by which he justifies us.184 



518 Christ's whole life is a mystery of recapitulation. All Jesus did, said 
and suffered had for its aim restoring fallen man to his original 
vocation: 

When Christ became incarnate and was made man, he recapitulated in 
himself the long history of mankind and procured for us a "short cut" 
to salvation, so that what we had lost in Adam, that is, being in the 
image and likeness of God, we might recover in Christ Jesus.185 For 
this reason Christ experienced all the stages of life, thereby giving 
communion with God to all men.186 

Our communion in the mysteries of Jesus 

519 All Christ's riches "are for every individual and are everybody's 
property."187 Christ did not live his life for himself but for us, from his 
Incarnation "for us men and for our salvation" to his death "for our 
sins" and Resurrection "for our justification".188 He is still "our 
advocate with the Father", who "always lives to make intercession" for 
us.189 He remains ever "in the presence of God on our behalf, 
bringing before him all that he lived and suffered for us."190 

520 In all of his life Jesus presents himself as our model. He is "the 
perfect man",191 who invites us to become his disciples and follow 
him. In humbling himself, he has given us an example to imitate, 
through his prayer he draws us to pray, and by his poverty he calls us to 
accept freely the privation and persecutions that may come our 
way.192 

521 Christ enables us to live in him all that he himself lived, and he 
lives it in us. "By his Incarnation, he, the Son of God, has in a certain 
way united himself with each man."193 We are called only to become 
one with him, for he enables us as the members of his Body to share in 
what he lived for us in his flesh as our model: 

We must continue to accomplish in ourselves the stages of Jesus' life 
and his mysteries and often to beg him to perfect and realize them in 
us and in his whole Church. . . For it is the plan of the Son of God to 
make us and the whole Church partake in his mysteries and to extend 
them to and continue them in us and in his whole Church. This is his 
plan for fulfilling his mysteries in us.194 



II. THE MYSTERIES OF JESUS' INFANCY AND HIDDEN LIFE 

The preparations 

522 The coming of God's Son to earth is an event of such immensity 
that God willed to prepare for it over centuries. He makes everything 
converge on Christ: all the rituals and sacrifices, figures and symbols of 
the "First Covenant".195 He announces him through the mouths of 
the prophets who succeeded one another in Israel. Moreover, he 
awakens in the hearts of the pagans a dim expectation of this coming. 

523 St. John the Baptist is the Lord's immediate precursor or 
forerunner, sent to prepare his way.196 "Prophet of the Most High", 
John surpasses all the prophets, of whom he is the last.197 He 
inaugurates the Gospel, already from his mother's womb welcomes the 
coming of Christ, and rejoices in being "the friend of the bridegroom", 
whom he points out as "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of 
the world".198 Going before Jesus "in the spirit and power of Elijah", 
John bears witness to Christ in his preaching, by his Baptism of 
conversion, and through his martyrdom.199 

524 When the Church celebrates the liturgy of Advent each year, she 
makes present this ancient expectancy of the Messiah, for by sharing in 
the long preparation for the Saviour's first coming, the faithful renew 
their ardent desire for his second coming.200 By celebrating the 
precursor's birth and martyrdom, the Church unites herself to his 
desire: "He must increase, but I must decrease."201 

The Christmas mystery 

525 Jesus was born in a humble stable, into a poor family.202 Simple 
shepherds were the first witnesses to this event. In this poverty heaven's 
glory was made manifest.203 The Church never tires of singing the 
glory of this night: 

The Virgin today brings into the world the Eternal 

and the earth offers a cave to the Inaccessible. 

The angels and shepherds praise him 

and the magi advance with the star, 

For you are born for us, 



Little Child, God eternal!204 

526 To become a child in relation to God is the condition for entering 
the kingdom.205 For this, we must humble ourselves and become 
little. Even more: to become "children of God" we must be "born from 
above" or "born of God".206 Only when Christ is formed in us will the 
mystery of Christmas be fulfilled in us.207 Christmas is the mystery of 
this "marvellous exchange": 

O marvellous exchange! Man's Creator has become man, born of the 
Virgin. We have been made sharers in the divinity of Christ who 
humbled himself to share our humanity.208 

The mysteries of Jesus' infancy 

527 Jesus' circumcision, on the eighth day after his birth,209 is the sign 
of his incorporation into Abraham's descendants, into the people of the 
covenant. It is the sign of his submission to the Law210 and his 
deputation to Israel's worship, in which he will participate throughout 
his life. This sign prefigures that "circumcision of Christ" which is 
Baptism.211 

528 The Epiphany is the manifestation of Jesus as Messiah of Israel, 
Son of God and Saviour of the world. the great feast of Epiphany 
celebrates the adoration of Jesus by the wise men (magi) from the East, 
together with his baptism in the Jordan and the wedding feast at Cana 
in Galilee.212 In the magi, representatives of the neighbouring pagan 
religions, the Gospel sees the first-fruits of the nations, who welcome 
the good news of salvation through the Incarnation. the magi's coming 
to Jerusalem in order to pay homage to the king of the Jews shows that 
they seek in Israel, in the messianic light of the star of David, the one 
who will be king of the nations.213 Their coming means that pagans 
can discover Jesus and worship him as Son of God and Saviour of the 
world only by turning towards the Jews and receiving from them the 
messianic promise as contained in the Old Testament.214 The 
Epiphany shows that "the full number of the nations" now takes its 
"place in the family of the patriarchs", and acquires Israelitica 
dignitas215 (is made "worthy of the heritage of Israel"). 

529 The presentation of Jesus in the temple shows him to be the 
firstborn Son who belongs to the Lord.216 With Simeon and Anna, all 



Israel awaits its encounter with the Saviour - the name given to this 
event in the Byzantine tradition. Jesus is recognized as the long-
expected Messiah, the "light to the nations" and the "glory of Israel", 
but also "a sign that is spoken against". the sword of sorrow predicted 
for Mary announces Christ's perfect and unique oblation on the cross 
that will impart the salvation God had "prepared in the presence of all 
peoples". 

530 The flight into Egypt and the massacre of the innocents217 make 
manifest the opposition of darkness to the light: "He came to his own 
home, and his own people received him not."218 Christ's whole life 
was lived under the sign of persecution. His own share it with him.219 
Jesus' departure from Egypt recalls the exodus and presents him as the 
definitive liberator of God's people.220 

The mysteries of Jesus' hidden life 

531 During the greater part of his life Jesus shared the condition of the 
vast majority of human beings: a daily life spent without evident 
greatness, a life of manual labour. His religious life was that of a Jew 
obedient to the law of God,221 a life in the community. From this 
whole period it is revealed to us that Jesus was "obedient" to his 
parents and that he "increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favour 
with God and man."222 

532 Jesus' obedience to his mother and legal father fulfils the fourth 
commandment perfectly and was the temporal image of his filial 
obedience to his Father in heaven. the everyday obedience of Jesus to 
Joseph and Mary both announced and anticipated the obedience of 
Holy Thursday: "Not my will. . ."223 The obedience of Christ in the 
daily routine of his hidden life was already inaugurating his work of 
restoring what the disobedience of Adam had destroyed.224 

533 The hidden life at Nazareth allows everyone to enter into 
fellowship with Jesus by the most ordinary events of daily life: 

The home of Nazareth is the school where we begin to understand the 
life of Jesus - the school of the Gospel. First, then, a lesson of silence. 
May esteem for silence, that admirable and indispensable condition of 
mind, revive in us. . . A lesson on family life. May Nazareth teach us 
what family life is, its communion of love, its austere and simple 



beauty, and its sacred and inviolable character... A lesson of work. 
Nazareth, home of the "Carpenter's Son", in you I would choose to 
understand and proclaim the severe and redeeming law of human 
work. . . To conclude, I want to greet all the workers of the world, 
holding up to them their great pattern their brother who is God.225 

534 The finding of Jesus in the temple is the only event that breaks the 
silence of the Gospels about the hidden years of Jesus.226 Here Jesus 
lets us catch a glimpse of the mystery of his total consecration to a 
mission that flows from his divine sonship: "Did you not know that I 
must be about my Father's work?"227 Mary and Joseph did not 
understand these words, but they accepted them in faith. Mary "kept 
all these things in her heart" during the years Jesus remained hidden in 
the silence of an ordinary life. 

III. THE MYSTERIES OF JESUS' PUBLIC LIFE 

The baptism of Jesus 

535 Jesus' public life begins with his baptism by John in the Jordan.228 
John preaches "a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins".229 
A crowd of sinners230 - tax collectors and soldiers, Pharisees and 
Sadducees, and prostitutes - come to be baptized by him. "Then Jesus 
appears." the Baptist hesitates, but Jesus insists and receives baptism. 
Then the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, comes upon Jesus and a 
voice from heaven proclaims, "This is my beloved Son."231 This is the 
manifestation ("Epiphany") of Jesus as Messiah of Israel and Son of 
God. 

536 The baptism of Jesus is on his part the acceptance and 
inauguration of his mission as God's suffering Servant. He allows 
himself to be numbered among sinners; he is already "the Lamb of 
God, who takes away the sin of the world".232 Already he is 
anticipating the "baptism" of his bloody death.233 Already he is 
coming to "fulfil all righteousness", that is, he is submitting himself 
entirely to his Father's will: out of love he consents to this baptism of 
death for the remission of our sins.234 The Father's voice responds to 
the Son's acceptance, proclaiming his entire delight in his Son.235 The 
Spirit whom Jesus possessed in fullness from his conception comes to 
"rest on him".236 Jesus will be the source of the Spirit for all mankind. 



At his baptism "the heavens were opened"237 - the heavens that 
Adam's sin had closed - and the waters were sanctified by the descent 
of Jesus and the Spirit, a prelude to the new creation. 

537 Through Baptism the Christian is sacramentally assimilated to 
Jesus, who in his own baptism anticipates his death and resurrection. 
the Christian must enter into this mystery of humble self-abasement 
and repentance, go down into the water with Jesus in order to rise with 
him, be reborn of water and the Spirit so as to become the Father's 
beloved son in the Son and "walk in newness of life":238 

Let us be buried with Christ by Baptism to rise with him; let us go 
down with him to be raised with him; and let us rise with him to be 
glorified with him.239 

  

Everything that happened to Christ lets us know that, after the bath of 
water, the Holy Spirit swoops down upon us from high heaven and 
that, adopted by the Father's voice, we become sons of God.240 

Jesus' temptations 

538 The Gospels speak of a time of solitude for Jesus in the desert 
immediately after his baptism by John. Driven by the Spirit into the 
desert, Jesus remains there for forty days without eating; he lives 
among wild beasts, and angels minister to him.241 At the end of this 
time Satan tempts him three times, seeking to compromise his filial 
attitude toward God. Jesus rebuffs these attacks, which recapitulate the 
temptations of Adam in Paradise and of Israel in the desert, and the 
devil leaves him "until an opportune time".242 

539 The evangelists indicate the salvific meaning of this mysterious 
event: Jesus is the new Adam who remained faithful just where the first 
Adam had given in to temptation. Jesus fulfils Israel's vocation 
perfectly: in contrast to those who had once provoked God during 
forty years in the desert, Christ reveals himself as God's Servant, totally 
obedient to the divine will. In this, Jesus is the devil's conqueror: he 
"binds the strong man" to take back his plunder.243 Jesus' victory over 
the tempter in the desert anticipates victory at the Passion, the 
supreme act of obedience of his filial love for the Father. 



540 Jesus' temptation reveals the way in which the Son of God is 
Messiah, contrary to the way Satan proposes to him and the way men 
wish to attribute to him.244 This is why Christ vanquished the 
Tempter for us: "For we have not a high priest who is unable to 
sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has 
been tested as we are, yet without sinning."245 By the solemn forty 
days of Lent the Church unites herself each year to the mystery of 
Jesus in the desert. 

"The kingdom of God is at hand" 

541 "Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching 
the gospel of God, and saying: 'The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom 
of God is at hand: repent, and believe in the gospel.'"246 "To carry out 
the will of the Father Christ inaugurated the kingdom of heaven on 
earth."247 Now the Father's will is "to raise up men to share in his 
own divine life".248 He does this by gathering men around his Son 
Jesus Christ. This gathering is the Church, "on earth the seed and 
beginning of that kingdoms".249 

542 Christ stands at the heart of this gathering of men into the "family 
of God". By his word, through signs that manifest the reign of God, 
and by sending out his disciples, Jesus calls all people to come together 
around him. But above all in the great Paschal mystery - his death on 
the cross and his Resurrection - he would accomplish the coming of his 
kingdom. "and I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men 
to myself." Into this union with Christ all men are called.250 

The proclamation of the kingdom of God 

543 Everyone is called to enter the kingdom. First announced to the 
children of Israel, this messianic kingdom is intended to accept men of 
all nations.251 To enter it, one must first accept Jesus' word: 

The word of the Lord is compared to a seed which is sown in a field; 
those who hear it with faith and are numbered among the little flock of 
Christ have truly received the kingdom. Then, by its own power, the 
seed sprouts and grows until the harvest.252 

544 The kingdom belongs to the poor and lowly, which means those 
who have accepted it with humble hearts. Jesus is sent to "preach good 



news to the poor";253 he declares them blessed, for "theirs is the 
kingdom of heaven."254 To them - the "little ones" the Father is 
pleased to reveal what remains hidden from the wise and the 
learned.255 Jesus shares the life of the poor, from the cradle to the 
cross; he experiences hunger, thirst and privation.256 Jesus identifies 
himself with the poor of every kind and makes active love toward them 
the condition for entering his kingdom.257 

545 Jesus invites sinners to the table of the kingdom: "I came not to 
call the righteous, but sinners."258 He invites them to that conversion 
without which one cannot enter the kingdom, but shows them in word 
and deed his Father's boundless mercy for them and the vast "joy in 
heaven over one sinner who repents".259 The supreme proof of his 
love will be the sacrifice of his own life "for the forgiveness of sins".260 

546 Jesus' invitation to enter his kingdom comes in the form of 
parables, a characteristic feature of his teaching.261 Through his 
parables he invites people to the feast of the kingdom, but he also asks 
for a radical choice: to gain the kingdom, one must give everything.262 
Words are not enough, deeds are required.263 The parables are like 
mirrors for man: will he be hard soil or good earth for the word?264 
What use has he made of the talents he has received?265 Jesus and the 
presence of the kingdom in this world are secretly at the heart of the 
parables. One must enter the kingdom, that is, become a disciple of 
Christ, in order to "know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven".266 
For those who stay "outside", everything remains enigmatic.267 

The signs of the kingdom of God 

547 Jesus accompanies his words with many "mighty works and 
wonders and signs", which manifest that the kingdom is present in him 
and attest that he was the promised Messiah.268 

548 The signs worked by Jesus attest that the Father has sent him. 
They invite belief in him.269 To those who turn to him in faith, he 
grants what they ask.270 So miracles strengthen faith in the One who 
does his Father's works; they bear witness that he is the Son of 
God.271 But his miracles can also be occasions for "offence";272 they 
are not intended to satisfy people's curiosity or desire for magic 



Despite his evident miracles some people reject Jesus; he is even 
accused of acting by the power of demons.273 

549 By freeing some individuals from the earthly evils of hunger, 
injustice, illness and death,274 Jesus performed messianic signs. 
Nevertheless he did not come to abolish all evils here below,275 but to 
free men from the gravest slavery, sin, which thwarts them in their 
vocation as God's sons and causes all forms of human bondage.276 

550 The coming of God's kingdom means the defeat of Satan's: "If it is 
by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God 
has come upon you."277 Jesus' exorcisms free some individuals from 
the domination of demons. They anticipate Jesus' great victory over 
"the ruler of this world".278 The kingdom of God will be definitively 
established through Christ's cross: "God reigned from the wood."279 

"The keys of the kingdom" 

551 From the beginning of his public life Jesus chose certain men, 
twelve in number, to be with him and to participate in his mission.280 
He gives the Twelve a share in his authority and 'sent them out to 
preach the kingdom of God and to heal."281 They remain associated 
for ever with Christ's kingdom, for through them he directs the 
Church: 

As my Father appointed a kingdom for me, so do I appoint for you that 
you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones 
judging the twelve tribes of Israel.282 

552 Simon Peter holds the first place in the college of the Twelve;283 
Jesus entrusted a unique mission to him. Through a revelation from the 
Father, Peter had confessed: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living 
God." Our Lord then declared to him: "You are Peter, and on this rock 
I will build my Church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against 
it."284 Christ, the "living Stone",285 thus assures his Church, built on 
Peter, of victory over the powers of death. Because of the faith he 
confessed Peter will remain the unshakeable rock of the Church. His 
mission will be to keep this faith from every lapse and to strengthen his 
brothers in it.286 



553 Jesus entrusted a specific authority to Peter: "I will give you the 
keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall 
be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in 
heaven."287 The "power of the keys" designates authority to govern the 
house of God, which is the Church. Jesus, the Good Shepherd, 
confirmed this mandate after his Resurrection: "Feed my sheep."288 
The power to "bind and loose" connotes the authority to absolve sins, 
to pronounce doctrinal judgements, and to make disciplinary decisions 
in the Church. Jesus entrusted this authority to the Church through 
the ministry of the apostles289 and in particular through the ministry 
of Peter, the only one to whom he specifically entrusted the keys of the 
kingdom. 

A foretaste of the kingdom: the Transfiguration 

554 From the day Peter confessed that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of 
the living God, the Master "began to show his disciples that he must go 
to Jerusalem and suffer many things. . . and be killed, and on the third 
day be raised."290 Peter scorns this prediction, nor do the others 
understand it any better than he.291 In this context the mysterious 
episode of Jesus' Transfiguration takes place on a high mountain,292 
before three witnesses chosen by himself: Peter, James and John. Jesus' 
face and clothes become dazzling with light, and Moses and Elijah 
appear, speaking "of his departure, which he was to accomplish at 
Jerusalem".293 A cloud covers him and a voice from heaven says: 
"This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!"294 

555 For a moment Jesus discloses his divine glory, confirming Peter's 
confession. He also reveals that he will have to go by the way of the 
cross at Jerusalem in order to "enter into his glory".295  

Moses and Elijah had seen God's glory on the Mountain; the Law and 
the Prophets had announced the Messiah's sufferings.296 Christ's 
Passion is the will of the Father: the Son acts as God's servant;297 The 
cloud indicates the presence of the Holy Spirit. "The whole Trinity 
appeared: the Father in the voice; the Son in the man; the Spirit in the 
shining cloud."298 

You were transfigured on the mountain, and your disciples, as much as 
they were capable of it, beheld your glory, O Christ our God, so that 



when they should see you crucified they would understand that your 
Passion was voluntary, and proclaim to the world that you truly are the 
splendour of the Father.299 

556 On the threshold of the public life: the baptism; on the threshold 
of the Passover: the Transfiguration. Jesus' baptism proclaimed "the 
mystery of the first regeneration", namely, our Baptism; the 
Transfiguration "is the sacrament of the second regeneration": our own 
Resurrection.300 From now on we share in the Lord's Resurrection 
through the Spirit who acts in the sacraments of the Body of Christ. 
the Transfiguration gives us a foretaste of Christ's glorious coming, 
when he "will change our lowly body to be like his glorious body."301 
But it also recalls that "it is through many persecutions that we must 
enter the kingdom of God":302 

Peter did not yet understand this when he wanted to remain with 
Christ on the mountain. It has been reserved for you, Peter, but for 
after death. For now, Jesus says: "Go down to toil on earth, to serve on 
earth, to be scorned and crucified on earth. Life goes down to be 
killed; Bread goes down to suffer hunger; the Way goes down to be 
exhausted on his journey; the Spring goes down to suffer thirst; and 
you refuse to suffer?"303 

Jesus' ascent to Jerusalem 

557 "When the days drew near for him to be taken up [Jesus] set his 
face to go to Jerusalem."304 By this decision he indicated that he was 
going up to Jerusalem prepared to die there. Three times he had 
announced his Passion and Resurrection; now, heading toward 
Jerusalem, Jesus says: "It cannot be that a prophet should perish away 
from Jerusalem."305 

558 Jesus recalls the martyrdom of the prophets who had been put to 
death in Jerusalem. Nevertheless he persists in calling Jerusalem to 
gather around him: "How often would I have gathered your children 
together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would 
not!"306 When Jerusalem comes into view he weeps over her and 
expresses once again his heart's desire: "Would that even today you 
knew the things that make for peace! But now they are hid from your 
eyes."307 



Jesus' messianic entrance into Jerusalem 

559 How will Jerusalem welcome her Messiah? Although Jesus had 
always refused popular attempts to make him king, he chooses the time 
and prepares the details for his messianic entry into the city of "his 
father David".308 Acclaimed as son of David, as the one who brings 
salvation (Hosanna means "Save!" or "Give salvation!"), the "King of 
glory" enters his City "riding on an ass".309 Jesus conquers the 
Daughter of Zion, a figure of his Church, neither by ruse nor by 
violence, but by the humility that bears witness to the truth.310 and so 
the subjects of his kingdom on that day are children and God's poor, 
who acclaim him as had the angels when they announced him to the 
shepherds.311 Their acclamation, "Blessed be he who comes in the 
name of the Lord",312 is taken up by the Church in the Sanctus of the 
Eucharistic liturgy that introduces the memorial of the Lord's Passover. 

560 Jesus' entry into Jerusalem manifested the coming of the kingdom 
that the King-Messiah was going to accomplish by the Passover of his 
Death and Resurrection. It is with the celebration of that entry on 
Palm Sunday that the Church's liturgy solemnly opens Holy Week. 

IN BRIEF 

561 "The whole of Christ's life was a continual teaching: his silences, 
his miracles, his gestures, his prayer, his love for people, his special 
affection for the little and the poor, his acceptance of the total sacrifice 
on the Cross for the redemption of the world, and his Resurrection are 
the actualization of his word and the fulfilment of Revelation" John 
Paul II, CT 9). 

562 Christ's disciples are to conform themselves to him until he is 
formed in them (cf Gal 4:19). "For this reason we, who have been 
made like to him, who have died with him and risen with him, are 
taken up into the mysteries of his life, until we reign together with him" 
(LG 7 # 4). 

563 No one, whether shepherd or wise man, can approach God here 
below except by kneeling before the manger at Bethlehem and adoring 
him hidden in the weakness of a new-born child. 



564 By his obedience to Mary and Joseph, as well as by his humble 
work during the long years in Nazareth, Jesus gives us the example of 
holiness in the daily life of family and work. 

565 From the beginning of his public life, at his baptism, Jesus is the 
"Servant", wholly consecrated to the redemptive work that he will 
accomplish by the "baptism" of his Passion. 

566 The temptation in the desert shows Jesus, the humble Messiah, 
who triumphs over Satan by his total adherence to the plan of salvation 
willed by the Father. 

567 The kingdom of heaven was inaugurated on earth by Christ. "This 
kingdom shone out before men in the word, in the works and in the 
presence of Christ" (LG 5). the Church is the seed and beginning of 
this kingdom. Its keys are entrusted to Peter. 

568 Christ's Transfiguration aims at strengthening the apostles' faith in 
anticipation of his Passion: the ascent on to the "high mountain" 
prepares for the ascent to Calvary. Christ, Head of the Church, 
manifests what his Body contains and radiates in the sacraments: "the 
hope of glory" (Col 1:27; cf.: St. Leo the Great, Sermo 51, 3: PL 54, 
310C). 

569 Jesus went up to Jerusalem voluntarily, knowing well that there he 
would die a violent death because of the opposition of sinners (cf ? 
Heb 12:3). 

570 Jesus' entry into Jerusalem manifests the coming of the kingdom 
that the Messiah-King, welcomed into his city by children and the 
humble of heart, is going to accomplish by the Passover of his Death

571 The Paschal mystery of Christ's cross and Resurrection stands at 
the centre of the Good News that the apostles, and the Church 
following them, are to proclaim to the world. God's saving plan was 
accomplished "once for all"313 by the redemptive death of his Son 
Jesus Christ. 

572 The Church remains faithful to the interpretation of "all the 
Scriptures" that Jesus gave both before and after his Passover: "Was it 
not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into 
his glory?"314 Jesus' sufferings took their historical, concrete form 
from the fact that he was "rejected by the elders and the chief priests 
and the scribes", who handed "him to the Gentiles to be mocked and 
scourged and crucified".315 

573 Faith can therefore try to examine the circumstances of Jesus' 
death, faithfully handed on by the Gospels316 and illuminated by 
other historical sources, the better to understand the meaning of the 
Redemption.

Paragraph 1. JESUS AND ISRAEL 

574 From the beginning of Jesus' public ministry, certain Pharisees 
and partisans of Herod together with priests and scribes agreed 
together to destroy him.317 Because of certain acts of his expelling 
demons, forgiving sins, healing on the sabbath day, his novel 
interpretation of the precepts of the Law regarding purity, and his 
familiarity with tax collectors and public sinners318--some ill-
intentioned persons suspected Jesus of demonic possession.319 He is 
accused of blasphemy and false prophecy, religious crimes which the 
Law punished with death by stoning.320 

575 Many of Jesus' deeds and words constituted a "sign of 
contradiction",321 but more so for the religious authorities in 
Jerusalem, whom the Gospel according to John often calls simply "the 
Jews",322 than for the ordinary People of God.323 To be sure, Christ's 
relations with the Pharisees were not exclusively polemical. Some 
Pharisees warn him of the danger he was courting;324 Jesus praises 
some of them, like the scribe of Mark 12:34, and dines several times at 
their homes.325 Jesus endorses some of the teachings imparted by this 
religious elite of God's people: the resurrection of the dead,326 certain 
forms of piety (almsgiving, fasting and prayer),327 The custom of 
addressing God as Father, and the centrality of the commandment to 
love God and neighbour.328 

576 In the eyes of many in Israel, Jesus seems to be acting against 
essential institutions of the Chosen People: - submission to the whole 



of the Law in its written commandments and, for the Pharisees, in the 
interpretation of oral tradition; - the centrality of the Temple at 
Jerusalem as the holy place where God's presence dwells in a special 
way; - faith in the one God whose glory no man can share. 

I. JESUS AND THE LAW 

577 At the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount Jesus issued a 
solemn warning in which he presented God's law, given on Sinai 
during the first covenant, in light of the grace of the New Covenant: 

Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets: I 
have come not to abolish but to fulfil. For truly I tell you, until heaven 
and earth pass away, not one letter, not one stroke of a letter, will pass 
from the law, until all is accomplished. Therefore, whoever breaks one 
of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the 
same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does 
them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of 
heaven.329 

578 Jesus, Israel's Messiah and therefore the greatest in the kingdom of 
heaven, was to fulfil the Law by keeping it in its all embracing detail - 
according to his own words, down to "the least of these 
commandments".330 He is in fact the only one who could keep it 
perfectly.331 On their own admission the Jews were never able to 
observe the Law in its entirety without violating the least of its 
precepts.332 This is why every year on the Day of Atonement the 
children of Israel ask God's forgiveness for their transgressions of the 
Law. the Law indeed makes up one inseparable whole, and St. James 
recalls, "Whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has 
become guilty of all of it."333 

579 This principle of integral observance of the Law not only in letter 
but in spirit was dear to the Pharisees. By giving Israel this principle 
they had led many Jews of Jesus' time to an extreme religious zeal.334 
This zeal, were it not to lapse into "hypocritical" casuistry,335 could 
only prepare the People for the unprecedented intervention of God 
through the perfect fulfilment of the Law by the only Righteous One in 
place of all sinners.336 



580 The perfect fulfilment of the Law could be the work of none but 
the divine legislator, born subject to the Law in the person of the 
Son.337 In Jesus, the Law no longer appears engraved on tables of 
stone but "upon the heart" of the Servant who becomes "a covenant to 
the people", because he will "faithfully bring forth justice".338 Jesus 
fulfils the Law to the point of taking upon himself "the curse of the 
Law" incurred by those who do not "abide by the things written in the 
book of the Law, and do them", for his death took place to redeem 
them "from the transgressions under the first covenant".339 

581 The Jewish people and their spiritual leaders viewed Jesus as a 
rabbi.340 He often argued within the framework of rabbinical 
interpretation of the Law.341 Yet Jesus could not help but offend the 
teachers of the Law, for he was not content to propose his 
interpretation alongside theirs but taught the people "as one who had 
authority, and not as their scribes".342 In Jesus, the same Word of God 
that had resounded on Mount Sinai to give the written Law to Moses, 
made itself heard anew on the Mount of the Beatitudes.343 Jesus did 
not abolish the Law but fulfilled it by giving its ultimate interpretation 
in a divine way: "You have heard that it was said to the men of old. . . 
But I say to you. . ."344 With this same divine authority, he disavowed 
certain human traditions of the Pharisees that were "making void the 
word of God".345 

582 Going even further, Jesus perfects the dietary law, so important in 
Jewish daily life, by revealing its pedagogical meaning through a divine 
interpretation: "Whatever goes into a man from outside cannot defile 
him. . . (Thus he declared all foods clean.). . . What comes out of a 
man is what defiles a man. For from within, out of the heart of man, 
come evil thoughts. . ."346 In presenting with divine authority the 
definitive interpretation of the Law, Jesus found himself confronted by 
certain teachers of the Law who did not accept his interpretation of the 
Law, guaranteed though it was by the divine signs that accompanied 
it.347 This was the case especially with the sabbath laws, for he recalls, 
often with rabbinical arguments, that the sabbath rest is not violated by 
serving God and neighbour,348 which his own healings did. 

II. JESUS AND THE TEMPLE 



583 Like the prophets before him Jesus expressed the deepest respect 
for the Temple in Jerusalem. It was in the Temple that Joseph and Mary 
presented him forty days after his birth.349 At the age of twelve he 
decided to remain in the Temple to remind his parents that he must be 
about his Father's business.350 He went there each year during his 
hidden life at least for Passover.351 His public ministry itself was 
patterned by his pilgrimages to Jerusalem for the great Jewish 
feasts.352 

584 Jesus went up to the Temple as the privileged place of encounter 
with God. For him, the Temple was the dwelling of his Father, a house 
of prayer, and he was angered that its outer court had become a place 
of commerce.353 He drove merchants out of it because of jealous love 
for his Father: "You shall not make my Father's house a house of trade. 
His disciples remembered that it was written, 'Zeal for your house will 
consume me.'"354 After his Resurrection his apostles retained their 
reverence for the Temple.355 

585 On the threshold of his Passion Jesus announced the coming 
destruction of this splendid building, of which there would not remain 
"one stone upon another".356 By doing so, he announced a sign of the 
last days, which were to begin with his own Passover.357 But this 
prophecy would be distorted in its telling by false witnesses during his 
interrogation at the high priest's house, and would be thrown back at 
him as an insult when he was nailed to the cross.358 

586 Far from having been hostile to the Temple, where he gave the 
essential part of his teaching, Jesus was willing to pay the Temple-tax, 
associating with him Peter, whom he had just made the foundation of 
his future Church.359 He even identified himself with the Temple by 
presenting himself as God's definitive dwelling-place among men.360 
Therefore his being put to bodily death361 presaged the destruction of 
the Temple, which would manifest the dawning of a new age in the 
history of salvation: "The hour is coming when neither on this 
mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father."362 

III. JESUS AND ISRAEL'S FAITH IN THE ONE GOD AND 
SAVIOUR 



587 If the Law and the Jerusalem Temple could be occasions of 
opposition to Jesus by Israel's religious authorities, his role in the 
redemption of sins, the divine work par excellence, was the true 
stumbling-block for them.363 

588 Jesus scandalized the Pharisees by eating with tax collectors and 
sinners as familiarly as with themselves.364 Against those among them 
"who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised 
others", Jesus affirmed: "I have not come to call the righteous, but 
sinners to repentance."365 He went further by proclaiming before the 
Pharisees that, since sin is universal, those who pretend not to need 
salvation are blind to themselves.366 

589 Jesus gave scandal above all when he identified his merciful 
conduct toward sinners with God's own attitude toward them.367 He 
went so far as to hint that by sharing the table of sinners he was 
admitting them to the messianic banquet.368 But it was most 
especially by forgiving sins that Jesus placed the religious authorities of 
Israel on the horns of a dilemma. Were they not entitled to demand in 
consternation, "Who can forgive sins but God alone?"369 By forgiving 
sins Jesus either is blaspheming as a man who made himself God's 
equal, or is speaking the truth and his person really does make present 
and reveal God's name.370 

590 Only the divine identity of Jesus' person can justify so absolute a 
claim as "He who is not with me is against me"; and his saying that 
there was in him "something greater than Jonah,. . . greater than 
Solomon", something "greater than the Temple"; his reminder that 
David had called the Messiah his Lord,371 and his affirmations, 
"Before Abraham was, I AM", and even "I and the Father are one."372 

591 Jesus asked the religious authorities of Jerusalem to believe in him 
because of the Father's works which he accomplished.373 But such an 
act of faith must go through a mysterious death to self, for a new "birth 
from above" under the influence of divine grace.374 Such a demand 
for conversion in the face of so surprising a fulfilment of the 
promises375 allows one to understand the Sanhedrin's tragic 
misunderstanding of Jesus: they judged that he deserved the death 
sentence as a blasphemer.376 The members of the Sanhedrin were 



thus acting at the same time out of "ignorance" and the "hardness" of 
their "unbelief".377 

IN BRIEF 

592 Jesus did not abolish the Law of Sinai, but rather fulfilled it (cf Mt 
5:17-19) with such perfection (cf Jn 8:46) that he revealed its ultimate 
meaning (cf Mt 5:33) and redeemed the transgressions against it (cf 
Heb 9:15). 

593 Jesus venerated the Temple by going up to it for the Jewish feasts 
of pilgrimage, and with a jealous love he loved this dwelling of God 
among men. the Temple prefigures his own mystery. When he 
announces its destruction, it is as a manifestation of his own execution 
and of the entry into a new age in the history of salvation, when his 
Body would be the definitive Temple. 

594 Jesus performed acts, such as pardoning sins, that manifested him 
to be the Saviour God himself (cf Jn 5:16-18). Certain Jews, who did 
not recognize God made man (cf Jn 1:14), saw in him only a man who 
made himself God (Jn 10:33), and judged him as a blasphemer.

PART ONE: THE PROFESSION OF FAITH 

 

 

 

SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS 

 

 

 

CHAPTER TWO I BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST, THE ONLY SON 
OF GOD 

 

 

 

Article 4 "JESUS CHRIST SUFFERED UNDER PONTIUS 
PILATE, WAS CRUCIFIED, DIED AND WAS BURIED" 

 

 

Paragraph 2. JESUS DIED CRUCIFIED 

I. THE TRIAL OF JESUS 

Divisions among the Jewish authorities concerning Jesus 

595 Among the religious authorities of Jerusalem, not only were the 
Pharisee Nicodemus and the prominent Joseph of Arimathea both 
secret disciples of Jesus, but there was also long-standing dissension 
about him, so much so that St. John says of these authorities on the 
very eve of Christ's Passion, "many.. . believed in him", though very 
imperfectly.378 This is not surprising, if one recalls that on the day 
after Pentecost "a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith" 
and "some believers. . . belonged to the party of the Pharisees", to the 
point that St. James could tell St. Paul, "How many thousands there 



are among the Jews of those who have believed; and they are all zealous 
for the Law."379 

596 The religious authorities in Jerusalem were not unanimous about 
what stance to take towards Jesus.380 The Pharisees threatened to 
excommunicate his followers.381 To those who feared that "everyone 
will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our 
holy place and our nation", the high priest Caiaphas replied by 
prophesying: "It is expedient for you that one man should die for the 
people, and that the whole nation should not perish."382 The 
Sanhedrin, having declared Jesus deserving of death as a blasphemer 
but having lost the right to put anyone to death, hands him over to the 
Romans, accusing him of political revolt, a charge that puts him in the 
same category as Barabbas who had been accused of sedition.383 The 
chief priests also threatened Pilate politically so that he would 
condemn Jesus to death.384 

Jews are not collectively responsible for Jesus' death 

597 The historical complexity of Jesus' trial is apparent in the Gospel 
accounts. the personal sin of the participants (Judas, the Sanhedrin, 
Pilate) is known to God alone. Hence we cannot lay responsibility for 
the trial on the Jews in Jerusalem as a whole, despite the outcry of a 
manipulated crowd and the global reproaches contained in the 
apostles' calls to conversion after Pentecost.385 Jesus himself, in 
forgiving them on the cross, and Peter in following suit, both accept 
"the ignorance" of the Jews of Jerusalem and even of their leaders.386 
Still less can we extend responsibility to other Jews of different times 
and places, based merely on the crowd's cry: "His blood be on us and 
on our children!", a formula for ratifying a judicial sentence.387 As the 
Church declared at the Second Vatican Council: . . . 

Neither all Jews indiscriminately at that time, nor Jews today, can be 
charged with the crimes committed during his Passion. . . the Jews 
should not be spoken of as rejected or accursed as if this followed from 
holy Scripture.388 

All sinners were the authors of Christ's Passion 

598 In her Magisterial teaching of the faith and in the witness of her 
saints, the Church has never forgotten that "sinners were the authors 



and the ministers of all the sufferings that the divine Redeemer 
endured."389 Taking into account the fact that our sins affect Christ 
himself,390 The Church does not hesitate to impute to Christians the 
gravest responsibility for the torments inflicted upon Jesus, a 
responsibility with which they have all too often burdened the Jews 
alone: 

We must regard as guilty all those who continue to relapse into their 
sins. Since our sins made the Lord Christ suffer the torment of the 
cross, those who plunge themselves into disorders and crimes crucify 
the Son of God anew in their hearts (for he is in them) and hold him 
up to contempt. and it can be seen that our crime in this case is greater 
in us than in the Jews. As for them, according to the witness of the 
Apostle, "None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, 
they would not have crucified the Lord of glory." We, however, profess 
to know him. and when we deny him by our deeds, we in some way 
seem to lay violent hands on him.391 

  

Nor did demons crucify him; it is you who have crucified him and 
crucify him still, when you delight in your vices and sins.392 

II. CHRIST'S REDEMPTIVE DEATH IN GOD'S PLAN OF 
SALVATION 

"Jesus handed over according to the definite plan of God" 

599 Jesus' violent death was not the result of chance in an unfortunate 
coincidence of circumstances, but is part of the mystery of God's plan, 
as St. Peter explains to the Jews of Jerusalem in his first sermon on 
Pentecost: "This Jesus (was) delivered up according to the definite plan 
and foreknowledge of God."393 This Biblical language does not mean 
that those who handed him over were merely passive players in a 
scenario written in advance by God.394 

600 To God, all moments of time are present in their immediacy. When 
therefore he establishes his eternal plan of "predestination", he includes 
in it each person's free response to his grace: "In this city, in fact, both 
Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, 
gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, 



to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take 
place."395 For the sake of accomplishing his plan of salvation, God 
permitted the acts that flowed from their blindness.396  

"He died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures" 

601 The Scriptures had foretold this divine plan of salvation through 
the putting to death of "the righteous one, my Servant" as a mystery of 
universal redemption, that is, as the ransom that would free men from 
the slavery of sin.397 Citing a confession of faith that he himself had 
"received", St. Paul professes that "Christ died for our sins in 
accordance with the scriptures."398 In particular Jesus' redemptive 
death fulfils Isaiah's prophecy of the suffering Servant.399 Indeed 
Jesus himself explained the meaning of his life and death in the light of 
God's suffering Servant.400 After his Resurrection he gave this 
interpretation of the Scriptures to the disciples at Emmaus, and then 
to the apostles.401 

"For our sake God made him to be sin" 

602 Consequently, St. Peter can formulate the apostolic faith in the 
divine plan of salvation in this way: "You were ransomed from the futile 
ways inherited from your fathers... with the precious blood of Christ, 
like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. He was destined before the 
foundation of the world but was made manifest at the end of the times 
for your sake."402 Man's sins, following on original sin, are punishable 
by death.403 By sending his own Son in the form of a slave, in the 
form of a fallen humanity, on account of sin, God "made him to be sin 
who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of 
God."404 

603 Jesus did not experience reprobation as if he himself had 
sinned.405 But in the redeeming love that always united him to the 
Father, he assumed us in the state of our waywardness of sin, to the 
point that he could say in our name from the cross: "My God, my God, 
why have you forsaken me?"406 Having thus established him in 
solidarity with us sinners, God "did not spare his own Son but gave 
him up for us all", so that we might be "reconciled to God by the death 
of his Son".407 

God takes the initiative of universal redeeming love 



604 By giving up his own Son for our sins, God manifests that his plan 
for us is one of benevolent love, prior to any merit on our part: "In this 
is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to 
be the expiation for our sins."408 God "shows his love for us in that 
while we were yet sinners Christ died for us."409 

605 At the end of the parable of the lost sheep Jesus recalled that God's 
love excludes no one: "So it is not the will of your Father who is in 
heaven that one of these little ones should perish."410 He affirms that 
he came "to give his life as a ransom for many"; this last term is not 
restrictive, but contrasts the whole of humanity with the unique person 
of the redeemer who hands himself over to save us.411 The Church, 
following the apostles, teaches that Christ died for all men without 
exception: "There is not, never has been, and never will be a single 
human being for whom Christ did not suffer."412 

III. CHRIST OFFERED HIMSELF TO HIS FATHER FOR OUR 
SINS 

Christ's whole life is an offering to the Father 

606 The Son of God, who came down "from heaven, not to do (his) 
own will, but the will of him who sent (him)",413 said on coming into 
the world, "Lo, I have come to do your will, O God." "and by that will 
we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus 
Christ once for all."414 From the first moment of his Incarnation the 
Son embraces the Father's plan of divine salvation in his redemptive 
mission: "My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to 
accomplish his work."415 The sacrifice of Jesus "for the sins of the 
whole world"416 expresses his loving communion with the Father. 
"The Father loves me, because I lay down my life", said the Lord, 
"(for) I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may 
know that I love the Father."417 

607 The desire to embrace his Father's plan of redeeming love inspired 
Jesus' whole life,418 for his redemptive passion was the very reason for 
his Incarnation. and so he asked, "and what shall I say? 'Father, save 
me from this hour'? No, for this purpose I have come to this hour."419 
and again, "Shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given 



me?"420 From the cross, just before "It is finished", he said, "I 
thirst."421 

"The Lamb who takes away the sin of the world" 

608 After agreeing to baptize him along with the sinners, John the 
Baptist looked at Jesus and pointed him out as the "Lamb of God, who 
takes away the sin of the world".422 By doing so, he reveals that Jesus 
is at the same time the suffering Servant who silently allows himself to 
be led to the slaughter and who bears the sin of the multitudes, and 
also the Paschal Lamb, the symbol of Israel's redemption at the first 
Passover.423 Christ's whole life expresses his mission: "to serve, and to 
give his life as a ransom for many."424 

Jesus freely embraced the Father's redeeming love 

609 By embracing in his human heart the Father's love for men, Jesus 
"loved them to the end", for "greater love has no man than this, that a 
man lay down his life for his friends."425 In suffering and death his 
humanity became the free and perfect instrument of his divine love 
which desires the salvation of men.426 Indeed, out of love for his 
Father and for men, whom the Father wants to save, Jesus freely 
accepted his Passion and death: "No one takes [my life] from me, but I 
lay it down of my own accord."427 Hence the sovereign freedom of 
God's Son as he went out to his death.428 

At the Last Supper Jesus anticipated the free offering of his life 

610 Jesus gave the supreme expression of his free offering of himself at 
the meal shared with the twelve Apostles "on the night he was 
betrayed".429 On the eve of his Passion, while still free, Jesus 
transformed this Last Supper with the apostles into the memorial of 
his voluntary offering to the Father for the salvation of men: "This is 
my body which is given for you." "This is my blood of the covenant, 
which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."430 

611 The Eucharist that Christ institutes at that moment will be the 
memorial of his sacrifice.431 Jesus includes the apostles in his own 
offering and bids them perpetuate it.432 By doing so, the Lord 
institutes his apostles as priests of the New Covenant: "For their sakes 
I sanctify myself, so that they also may be sanctified in truth."433 



The agony at Gethsemani 

612 The cup of the New Covenant, which Jesus anticipated when he 
offered himself at the Last Supper, is afterwards accepted by him from 
his Father's hands in his agony in the garden at Gethsemani,434 
making himself "obedient unto death". Jesus prays: "My Father, if it be 
possible, let this cup pass from me. . ."435 Thus he expresses the 
horror that death represented for his human nature. Like ours, his 
human nature is destined for eternal life; but unlike ours, it is perfectly 
exempt from sin, the cause of death.436 Above all, his human nature 
has been assumed by the divine person of the "Author of life", the 
"Living One".437 By accepting in his human will that the Father's will 
be done, he accepts his death as redemptive, for "he himself bore our 
sins in his body on the tree."438 

Christ's death is the unique and definitive sacrifice 

613 Christ's death is both the Paschal sacrifice that accomplishes the 
definitive redemption of men, through "the Lamb of God, who takes 
away the sin of the world",439 and the sacrifice of the New Covenant, 
which restores man to communion with God by reconciling him to 
God through the "blood of the covenant, which was poured out for 
many for the forgiveness of sins".440 

614 This sacrifice of Christ is unique; it completes and surpasses all 
other sacrifices.441 First, it is a gift from God the Father himself, for 
the Father handed his Son over to sinners in order to reconcile us with 
himself. At the same time it is the offering of the Son of God made 
man, who in freedom and love offered his life to his Father through the 
Holy Spirit in reparation for our disobedience.442 

Jesus substitutes his obedience for our disobedience 

615 "For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by 
one man's obedience many will be made righteous."443 By his 
obedience unto death, Jesus accomplished the substitution of the 
suffering Servant, who "makes himself an offering for sin", when "he 
bore the sin of many", and who "shall make many to be accounted 
righteous", for "he shall bear their iniquities".444 Jesus atoned for our 
faults and made satisfaction for our sins to the Father.445 



Jesus consummates his sacrifice on the cross 

616 It is love "to the end"446 that confers on Christ's sacrifice its value 
as redemption and reparation, as atonement and satisfaction. He knew 
and loved us all when he offered his life.447 Now "the love of Christ 
controls us, because we are convinced that one has died for all; 
therefore all have died."448 No man, not even the holiest, was ever 
able to take on himself the sins of all men and offer himself as a 
sacrifice for all. the existence in Christ of the divine person of the Son, 
who at once surpasses and embraces all human persons, and 
constitutes himself as the Head of all mankind, makes possible his 
redemptive sacrifice for all. 

617 The Council of Trent emphasizes the unique character of Christ's 
sacrifice as "the source of eternal salvation"449 and teaches that "his 
most holy Passion on the wood of the cross merited justification for 
us."450 and the Church venerates his cross as she sings: "Hail, O 
Cross, our only hope."451 

Our participation in Christ's sacrifice 

618 The cross is the unique sacrifice of Christ, the "one mediator 
between God and men".452 But because in his incarnate divine person 
he has in some way united himself to every man, "the possibility of 
being made partners, in a way known to God, in the paschal mystery" 
is offered to all men.453 He calls his disciples to "take up [their] cross 
and follow (him)",454 for "Christ also suffered for (us), leaving (us) an 
example so that (we) should follow in his steps."455 In fact Jesus 
desires to associate with his redeeming sacrifice those who were to be 
its first beneficiaries.456 This is achieved supremely in the case of his 
mother, who was associated more intimately than any other person in 
the mystery of his redemptive suffering.457 Apart from the cross there 
is no other ladder by which we may get to heaven.458 

IN BRIEF 

619 "Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures" (I Cor 
15:3). 

620 Our salvation flows from God's initiative of love for us, because 
"he loved us and sent his Son to be the expiation for our sins" (I Jn 



4:10). "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself" (2 Cor 
5:19). 

621 Jesus freely offered himself for our salvation. Beforehand, during 
the Last Supper, he both symbolized this offering and made it really 
present: "This is my body which is given for you" (Lk 22:19). 

622 The redemption won by Christ consists in this, that he came "to 
give his life as a ransom for many" (Mt 20:28), that is, he "loved [his 
own] to the end" (Jn 13:1), so that they might be "ransomed from the 
futile ways inherited from [their] fathers" (I Pt 1:18). 

623 By his loving obedience to the Father, "unto death, even death on 
a cross" (Phil 2:8), Jesus fulfils the atoning mission (cf Is 53:10) of the 
suffering Servant, who will "make many righteous; and he shall bear 
their iniquities" (Is 53:11; cf. Rom 5:19).

OF GOD 

 

 

 

Article 4 "JESUS CHRIST SUFFERED UNDER PONTIUS 
PILATE, WAS CRUCIFIED, DIED AND WAS BURIED" 

 

 

Paragraph 3. JESUS CHRIST WAS BURIED 

624 "By the grace of God" Jesus tasted death "for every one".459 In his 
plan of salvation, God ordained that his Son should not only "die for 
our sins"460 but should also "taste death", experience the condition of 
death, the separation of his soul from his body, between the time he 
expired on the cross and the time he was raised from the dead. the 



state of the dead Christ is the mystery of the tomb and the descent into 
hell. It is the mystery of Holy Saturday, when Christ, lying in the 
tomb,461 reveals God's great sabbath rest462 after the fulfilment463 
of man's salvation, which brings peace to the whole universe.464 

Christ in the tomb in his body 

625 Christ's stay in the tomb constitutes the real link between his 
passible state before Easter and his glorious and risen state today. the 
same person of the "Living One" can say, "I died, and behold I am 
alive for evermore":465 

God [the Son] did not impede death from separating his soul from his 
body according to the necessary order of nature, but has reunited them 
to one another in the Resurrection, so that he himself might be, in his 
person, the meeting point for death and life, by arresting in himself the 
decomposition of nature produced by death and so becoming the 
source of reunion for the separated parts.466 

626 Since the "Author of life" who was killed467 is the same "living 
one [who has] risen",468 The divine person of the Son of God 
necessarily continued to possess his human soul and body, separated 
from each other by death: 

By the fact that at Chnst's death his soul was separated from his flesh, 
his one person is not itself divided into two persons; for the human 
body and soul of Christ have existed in the same way from the 
beginning of his earthly existence, in the divine person of the Word; 
and in death, although separated from each other, both remained with 
one and the same person of the Word.469 

"You will not let your Holy One see corruption" 

627 Christ's death was a real death in that it put an end to his earthly 
human existence. But because of the union which the person of the 
Son retained with his body, his was not a mortal corpse like others, for 
"it was not possible for death to hold him".469Bis and therefore 
"divine power preserved Christ's body from corruption."470 Both of 
these statements can be said of Christ: "He was cut off out of the land 
of the living",471 and "My flesh will dwell in hope. For you will not 
abandon my soul to Hades, nor let your Holy One see corruption."472 



Jesus' Resurrection "on the third day" was the sign of  this, also 
because bodily decay was held to begin on the fourth day after 
death.473 

p class=MsoNormal&gt;"Buried with Christ. . ."  

628 Baptism, the original and full sign of which is immersion, 
efficaciously signifies the descent into the tomb by the Christian who 
dies to sin with Christ in order to live a new life. "We were buried 
therefore with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised 
from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness 
of life."474 

IN BRIEF 

629 To the benefit of every man, Jesus Christ tasted death (cf Heb 
2:9). It is truly the Son of God made man who died and was buried. 

630 During Christ's period in the tomb, his divine person continued to 
assume both his soul and his body, although they were separated from 
each other by death. For this reason the dead Christ's body "saw no 
corruption" (Acts 13:37).

Article 5 "HE DESCENDED INTO HELL. ON THE THIRD DAY

631 Jesus "descended into the lower parts of the earth. He who 
descended is he who also ascended far above all the heavens."475 The 
Apostles' Creed confesses in the same article Christ's descent into hell 
and his Resurrection from the dead on the third day, because in his 
Passover it was precisely out of the depths of death that he made life 
spring forth: 

Christ, that Morning Star, who came back from the dead, and shed his 
peaceful light on all mankind, your Son who lives and reigns for ever 
and ever. Amen.476

Article 5 "HE DESCENDED INTO HELL. ON THE THIRD DAY 
HE ROSE AGAIN" 

 

 



Paragraph 1. CHRIST DESCENDED INTO HELL 

632 The frequent New Testament affirmations that Jesus was "raised 
from the dead" presuppose that the crucified one sojourned in the 
realm of the dead prior to his resurrection.477 This was the first 
meaning given in the apostolic preaching to Christ's descent into hell: 
that Jesus, like all men, experienced death and in his soul joined the 
others in the realm of the dead. But he descended there as Saviour, 
proclaiming the Good News to the spirits imprisoned there.478 

633 Scripture calls the abode of the dead, to which the dead Christ 
went down, "hell" - Sheol in Hebrew or Hades in Greek - because 
those who are there are deprived of the vision of God.479 Such is the 
case for all the dead, whether evil or righteous, while they await the 
Redeemer: which does not mean that their lot is identical, as Jesus 
shows through the parable of the poor man Lazarus who was received 
into "Abraham's bosom":480 "It is precisely these holy souls, who 
awaited their Saviour in Abraham's bosom, whom Christ the Lord 
delivered when he descended into hell."481 Jesus did not descend into 
hell to deliver the damned, nor to destroy the hell of damnation, but to 
free the just who had gone before him.482 

634 "The gospel was preached even to the dead."483 The descent into 
hell brings the Gospel message of salvation to complete fulfilment. This 
is the last phase of Jesus' messianic mission, a phase which is 
condensed in time but vast in its real significance: the spread of 
Christ's redemptive work to all men of all times and all places, for all 
who are saved have been made sharers in the redemption. 

635 Christ went down into the depths of death so that "the dead will 
hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live."484 
Jesus, "the Author of life", by dying destroyed "him who has the power 
of death, that is, the devil, and [delivered] all those who through fear of 
death were subject to lifelong bondage."485 Henceforth the risen 
Christ holds "the keys of Death and Hades", so that "at the name of 
Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the 
earth."486 

Today a great silence reigns on earth, a great silence and a great 
stillness. A great silence because the King is asleep. the earth trembled 



and is still because God has fallen asleep in the flesh and he has raised 
up all who have slept ever since the world began. . . He has gone to 
search for Adam, our first father, as for a lost sheep. Greatly desiring to 
visit those who live in darkness and in the shadow of death, he has 
gone to free from sorrow Adam in his bonds and Eve, captive with him 
- He who is both their God and the son of Eve. . . "I am your God, 
who for your sake have become your son. . . I order you, O sleeper, to 
awake. I did not create you to be a prisoner in hell. Rise from the dead, 
for I am the life of the dead."487 

IN BRIEF 

636 By the expression "He descended into hell", the Apostles' Creed 
confesses that Jesus did really die and through his death for us 
conquered death and the devil "who has the power of death" (Heb 
2:14). 

637 In his human soul united to his divine person, the dead Christ 
went down to the realm of the dead. He opened heaven's gates for the 
just who had gone before him.

Article 5 "HE DESCENDED INTO HELL. ON THE THIRD DAY

Paragraph 2. ON THE THIRD DAY HE ROSE FROM THE DEAD 

638 "We bring you the good news that what God promised to the 
fathers, this day he has fulfilled to us their children by raising 



Jesus."488 The Resurrection of Jesus is the crowning truth of our faith 
in Christ, a faith believed and lived as the central truth by the first 
Christian community; handed on as fundamental by Tradition; 
established by the documents of the New Testament; and preached as 
an essential part of the Paschal mystery along with the cross: 

Christ is risen from the dead! 

Dying, he conquered death; 

To the dead, he has given life.489 

I. THE HISTORICAL AND TRANSCENDENT EVENT 

639 The mystery of Christ's resurrection is a real event, with 
manifestations that were historically verified, as the New Testament 
bears witness. In about A.D. 56 St. Paul could already write to the 
Corinthians: "I delivered to you as of first importance what I also 
received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the 
scriptures, and that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day 
in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, 
then to the Twelve. . ."490 The Apostle speaks here of the living 
tradition of the Resurrection which he had learned after his conversion 
at the gates of Damascus.491 

The empty tomb 

640 "Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but 
has risen."492 The first element we encounter in the framework of the 
Easter events is the empty tomb. In itself it is not a direct proof of 
esurrection; the absence of Christ's body from the tomb could be 
explained otherwise.493 Nonetheless the empty tomb was still an 
essential sign for all. Its discovery by the disciples was the first step 
toward recognizing the very fact of the Resurrection. This was the case, 
first with the holy women, and then with Peter.494 The disciple 
"whom Jesus loved" affirmed that when he entered the empty tomb 
and discovered "the linen cloths lying there", "he saw and 
believed".495 This suggests that he realized from the empty tomb's 
condition that the absence of Jesus' body could not have been of 
human doing and that Jesus had not simply returned to earthly life as 
had been the case with Lazarus.496 



The appearances of the Risen One 

641 Mary Magdalene and the holy women who came to finish 
anointing the body of Jesus, which had been buried in haste because 
the Sabbath began on the evening of Good Friday, were the first to 
encounter the Risen One.497 Thus the women were the first 
messengers of Christ's Resurrection for the apostles themselves.498 
They were the next to whom Jesus appears: first Peter, then the Twelve. 
Peter had been called to strengthen the faith of his brothers,499 and so 
sees the Risen One before them; it is on the basis of his testimony that 
the community exclaims: "The Lord has risen indeed, and has 
appeared to Simon!"500 

642 Everything that happened during those Paschal days involves each 
of the apostles - and Peter in particular - in the building of the new era 
begun on Easter morning. As witnesses of the Risen One, they remain 
the foundation stones of his Church. the faith of the first community of 
believers is based on the witness of concrete men known to the 
Christians and for the most part still living among them. Peter and the 
Twelve are the primary "witnesses to his Resurrection", but they are 
not the only ones - Paul speaks clearly of more than five hundred 
persons to whom Jesus appeared on a single occasion and also of James 
and of all the apostles.501 

643 Given all these testimonies, Christ's Resurrection cannot be 
interpreted as something outside the physical order, and it is 
impossible not to acknowledge it as an historical fact. It is clear from 
the facts that the disciples' faith was drastically put to the test by their 
master's Passion and death on the cross, which he had foretold.502 
The shock provoked by the Passion was so great that at least some of 
the disciples did not at once believe in the news of the Resurrection. 
Far from showing us a community seized by a mystical exaltation, the 
Gospels present us with disciples demoralized ("looking sad"503) and 
frightened. For they had not believed the holy women returning from 
the tomb and had regarded their words as an "idle tale".504 When 
Jesus reveals himself to the Eleven on Easter evening, "he upbraided 
them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not 
believed those who saw him after he had risen."505 



644 Even when faced with the reality of the risen Jesus the disciples are 
still doubtful, so impossible did the thing seem: they thought they were 
seeing a ghost. "In their joy they were still disbelieving and still 
wondering."506 Thomas will also experience the test of doubt and St. 
Matthew relates that during the risen Lord's last appearance in Galilee 
"some doubted."507 Therefore the hypothesis that the Resurrection 
was produced by the apostles' faith (or credulity) will not hold up. On 
the contrary their faith in the Resurrection was born, under the action 
of divine grace, from their direct experience of the reality of the risen 
Jesus. 

The condition of Christ's risen humanity 

645 By means of touch and the sharing of a meal, the risen Jesus 
establishes direct contact with his disciples. He invites them in this way 
to recognize that he is not a ghost and above all to verify that the risen 
body in which he appears to them is the same body that had been 
tortured and crucified, for it still bears the traces of his Passion.508 Yet 
at the same time this authentic, real body possesses the new properties 
of a glorious body: not limited by space and time but able to be present 
how and when he wills; for Christ's humanity can no longer be 
confined to earth, and belongs henceforth only to the Father's divine 
realm.509 For this reason too the risen Jesus enjoys the sovereign 
freedom of appearing as he wishes: in the guise of a gardener or in 
other forms familiar to his disciples, precisely to awaken their faith.510 

646 Christ's Resurrection was not a return to earthly life, as was the 
case with the raisings from the dead that he had performed before 
Easter: Jairus' daughter, the young man of Naim, Lazarus. These 
actions were miraculous events, but the persons miraculously raised 
returned by Jesus' power to ordinary earthly life. At some particular 
moment they would die again. Christ's Resurrection is essentially 
different. In his risen body he passes from the state of death to another 
life beyond time and space. At Jesus' Resurrection his body is filled 
with the power of the Holy Spirit: he shares the divine life in his 
glorious state, so that St. Paul can say that Christ is "the man of 
heaven".511 

The Resurrection as transcendent event 



647 O truly blessed Night, sings the Exsultet of the Easter Vigil, which 
alone deserved to know the time and the hour when Christ rose from 
the realm of the dead!512 But no one was an eyewitness to Christ's 
Resurrection and no evangelist describes it. No one can say how it 
came about physically. Still less was its innermost essence, his passing 
over to another life, perceptible to the senses. Although the 
Resurrection was an historical event that could be verified by the sign 
of the empty tomb and by the reality of the apostles' encounters with 
the risen Christ, still it remains at the very heart of the mystery of faith 
as something that transcends and surpasses history. This is why the 
risen Christ does not reveal himself to the world, but to his disciples, 
"to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are 
now his witnesses to the people."513 

II. THE RESURRECTION - A WORK OF THE HOLY TRINITY 

648 Christ's Resurrection is an object of faith in that it is a 
transcendent intervention of God himself in creation and history. In it 
the three divine persons act together as one, and manifest their own 
proper characteristics. the Father's power "raised up" Christ his Son 
and by doing so perfectly introduced his Son's humanity, including his 
body, into the Trinity. Jesus is conclusively revealed as "Son of God in 
power according to the Spirit of holiness by his Resurrection from the 
dead".514 St. Paul insists on the manifestation of God's power515 
through the working of the Spirit who gave life to Jesus' dead humanity 
and called it to the glorious state of Lordship. 

649 As for the Son, he effects his own Resurrection by virtue of his 
divine power. Jesus announces that the Son of man will have to suffer 
much, die, and then rise.516 Elsewhere he affirms explicitly: "I lay 
down my life, that I may take it again. . . I have power to lay it down, 
and I have power to take it again."517 "We believe that Jesus died and 
rose again."518 

650 The Fathers contemplate the Resurrection from the perspective of 
the divine person of Christ who remained united to his soul and body, 
even when these were separated from each other by death: "By the 
unity of the divine nature, which remains present in each of the two 
components of man, these are reunited. For as death is produced by 



the separation of the human components, so Resurrection is achieved 
by the union of the two."519 

III. THE MEANING AND SAVING SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 
RESURRECTION 

651 "If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and 
your faith is in vain."520 The Resurrection above all constitutes the 
confirmation of all Christ's works and teachings. All truths, even those 
most inaccessible to human reason, find their justification if Christ by 
his Resurrection has given the definitive proof of his divine authority, 
which he had promised. 

652 Christ's Resurrection is the fulfilment of the promises both of the 
Old Testament and of Jesus himself during his earthly life.521 The 
phrase "in accordance with the Scriptures"522 indicates that Christ's 
Resurrection fulfilled these predictions. 

653 The truth of Jesus' divinity is confirmed by his Resurrection. He 
had said: "When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know 
that I am he."523 The Resurrection of the crucified one shows that he 
was truly "I AM", the Son of God and God himself. So St. Paul could 
declare to the Jews: "What God promised to the fathers, this he has 
fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus; as also it is written in the 
second psalm, 'You are my Son, today I have begotten you.'"524 
Christ's Resurrection is closely linked to the Incarnation of God's Son, 
and is its fulfilment in accordance with God's eternal plan. 

654 The Paschal mystery has two aspects: by his death, Christ liberates 
us from sin; by his Resurrection, he opens for us the way to a new life. 
This new life is above all justification that reinstates us in God's grace, 
"so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, 
we too might walk in newness of life." Justification consists in both 
victory over the death caused by sin and a new participation in 
grace.526 It brings about filial adoption so that men become Christ's 
brethren, as Jesus himself called his disciples after his Resurrection: 
"Go and tell my brethren."527 We are brethren not by nature, but by 
the gift of grace, because that adoptive filiation gains us a real share in 
the life of the only Son, which was fully revealed in his Resurrection. 



655 Finally, Christ's Resurrection - and the risen Christ himself is the 
principle and source of our future resurrection: "Christ has been raised 
from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep. . . For as 
in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive."528 The risen 
Christ lives in the hearts of his faithful while they await that fulfilment. 
In Christ, Christians "have tasted. . . the powers of the age to 
come"529 and their lives are swept up by Christ into the heart of 
divine life, so that they may "live no longer for themselves but for him 
who for their sake died and was raised."530 

IN BRIEF 

656 Faith in the Resurrection has as its object an event which as 
historically attested to by the disciples, who really encountered the 
Risen One. At the same time, this event is mysteriously transcendent 
insofar as it is the entry of Christ's humanity into the glory of God. 

657 The empty tomb and the linen cloths lying there signify in 
themselves that by God's power Christ's body had escaped the bonds 
of death and corruption. They prepared the disciples to encounter the 
Risen Lord. 

658 Christ, "the first-born from the dead" (Col 1:18), is the principle 
of our own resurrection, even now by the justification of our souls (cf 
Rom 6:4), and one day by the new life he will impart to our bodies (cf 
Rom 8:11).

CHAPTER TWO I BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST, THE ONLY SON 
OF GOD 

 

 

Article 6 "HE ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN AND IS SEATED AT 
THE RIGHT HAND OF THE FATHER" 

659 "So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken 
up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God."531 Christ's 
body was glorified at the moment of his Resurrection, as proved by the 
new and supernatural properties it subsequently and permanently 
enjoys.532 But during the forty days when he eats and drinks 
familiarly with his disciples and teaches them about the kingdom, his 
glory remains veiled under the appearance of ordinary humanity.533 
Jesus' final apparition ends with the irreversible entry of his humanity 
into divine glory, symbolized by the cloud and by heaven, where he is 
seated from that time forward at God's right hand.534 Only in a 
wholly exceptional and unique way would Jesus show himself to Paul 
"as to one untimely born", in a last apparition that established him as 
an apostle.535 

660 The veiled character of the glory of the Risen One during this time 
is intimated in his mysterious words to Mary Magdalene: "I have not 
yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I 
am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your 
God."536 This indicates a difference in manifestation between the 



glory of the risen Christ and that of the Christ exalted to the Father's 
right hand, a transition marked by the historical and transcendent 
event of the Ascension. 

661 This final stage stays closely linked to the first, that is, to his 
descent from heaven in the Incarnation. Only the one who "came from 
the Father" can return to the Father: Christ Jesus.537 "No one has 
ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven, the Son of 
man."538 Left to its own natural powers humanity does not have 
access to the "Father's house", to God's life and happiness.539 Only 
Christ can open to man such access that we, his members, might have 
confidence that we too shall go where he, our Head and our Source, 
has preceded us.540 

662 "and I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to 
myself."541 The lifting up of Jesus on the cross signifies and 
announces his lifting up by his Ascension into heaven, and indeed 
begins it. Jesus Christ, the one priest of the new and eternal Covenant, 
"entered, not into a sanctuary made by human hands. . . but into 
heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf."542 
There Christ permanently exercises his priesthood, for he "always lives 
to make intercession" for "those who draw near to God through 
him".543 As "high priest of the good things to come" he is the centre 
and the principal actor of the liturgy that honours the Father in 
heaven.544 

663 Henceforth Christ is seated at the right hand of the Father: "By 
'the Father's right hand' we understand the glory and honour of 
divinity, where he who exists as Son of God before all ages, indeed as 
God, of one being with the Father, is seated bodily after he became 
incarnate and his flesh was glorified."545 

664 Being seated at the Father's right hand signifies the inauguration 
of the Messiah's kingdom, the fulfilment of the prophet Daniel's vision 
concerning the Son of man: "To him was given dominion and glory 
and kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve 
him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass 
away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed."546 After this 
event the apostles became witnesses of the "kingdom [that] will have 
no end".547

Article 6 "HE ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN AND IS SEATED AT

IN BRIEF 

665 Christ's Ascension marks the definitive entrance of Jesus' humanity 
into God's heavenly domain, whence he will come again (cf Acts 1:11); 
this humanity in the meantime hides him from the eyes of men (cf Col 
3:3). 

666 Jesus Christ, the head of the Church, precedes us into the Father's 
glorious kingdom so that we, the members of his Body, may live in the 
hope of one day being with him for ever. 

667 Jesus Christ, having entered the sanctuary of heaven once and for 
all, intercedes constantly for us as the mediator who assures us of the 
permanent outpouring of the Holy Spirit.

Article 7 "FROM THENCE HE WILL COME AGAlN TO JUDGE 
THE LIVING AND THE DEAD" 

I. He Will Come Again in Glory 

Christ already reigns through the Church. . . 

668 "Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the 
dead and of the living."548 Christ's Ascension into heaven signifies his 
participation, in his humanity, in God's power and authority. Jesus 
Christ is Lord: he possesses all power in heaven and on earth. He is 
"far above all rule and authority and power and dominion", for the 
Father "has put all things under his feet."549 Christ is Lord of the 
cosmos and of history. In him human history and indeed all creation 
are "set forth" and transcendently fulfilled.550 

669 As Lord, Christ is also head of the Church, which is his Body.551 
Taken up to heaven and glorified after he had thus fully accomplished 
his mission, Christ dwells on earth in his Church. the redemption is 
the source of the authority that Christ, by virtue of the Holy Spirit, 
exercises over the Church. "The kingdom of Christ (is) already present 
in mystery", "on earth, the seed and the beginning of the 
kingdom".552 

670 Since the Ascension God's plan has entered into its fulfilment. We 
are already at "the last hour".553 "Already the final age of the world is 
with us, and the renewal of the world is irrevocably under way; it is 
even now anticipated in a certain real way, for the Church on earth is 



endowed already with a sanctity that is real but imperfect."554 Christ's 
kingdom already manifests its presence through the miraculous signs 
that attend its proclamation by the Church.555  

. . . until all things are subjected to him 

671 Though already present in his Church, Christ's reign is 
nevertheless yet to be fulfilled "with power and great glory" by the 
King's return to earth.556 This reign is still under attack by the evil 
powers, even though they have been defeated definitively by Christ's 
Passover.557 Until everything is subject to him, "until there be realized 
new heavens and a new earth in which justice dwells, the pilgrim 
Church, in her sacraments and institutions, which belong to this 
present age, carries the mark of this world which will pass, and she 
herself takes her place among the creatures which groan and travail yet 
and await the revelation of the sons of God."558 That is why 
Christians pray, above all in the Eucharist, to hasten Christ's return by 
saying to him:559 Maranatha! "Our Lord, come!"560 

672 Before his Ascension Christ affirmed that the hour had not yet 
come for the glorious establishment of the messianic kingdom awaited 
by Israel561 which, according to the prophets, was to bring all men the 
definitive order of justice, love and peace.562 According to the Lord, 
the present time is the time of the Spirit and of witness, but also a time 
still marked by "distress" and the trial of evil which does not spare the 
Church563 and ushers in the struggles of the last days. It is a time of 
waiting and watching.564 

The glorious advent of Christ, the hope of Israel 

673 Since the Ascension Christ's coming in glory has been 
imminent,565 even though "it is not for you to know times or seasons 
which the Father has fixed by his own authority."566. This 
eschatological coming could be accomplished at any moment, even if 
both it and the final trial that will precede it are "delayed".567 

674 The glorious Messiah's coming is suspended at every moment of 
history until his recognition by "all Israel", for "a hardening has come 
upon part of Israel" in their "unbelief" toward Jesus.568 St. Peter says 
to the Jews of Jerusalem after Pentecost: "Repent therefore, and turn 
again, that your sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may 



come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ 
appointed for you, Jesus, whom heaven must receive until the time for 
establishing all that God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from 
of old."569 St. Paul echoes him: "For if their rejection means the 
reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life 
from the dead?"570 The "full inclusion" of the Jews in the Messiah's 
salvation, in the wake of "the full number of the Gentiles",571 will 
enable the People of God to achieve "the measure of the stature of the 
fullness of Christ", in which "God may be all in all".572 

The Church's ultimate trial 

675 Before Christ's second coming the Church must pass through a 
final trial that will shake the faith of many believers.573 The 
persecution that accompanies her pilgrimage on earth574 will unveil 
the "mystery of iniquity" in the form of a religious deception offering 
men an apparent solution to their problems at the price of apostasy 
from the truth. the supreme religious deception is that of the 
Antichrist, a pseudo-messianism by which man glorifies himself in 
place of God and of his Messiah come in the flesh.575 

676 The Antichrist's deception already begins to take shape in the 
world every time the claim is made to realize within history that 
messianic hope which can only be realized beyond history through the 
eschatological judgement. the Church has rejected even modified 
forms of this falsification of the kingdom to come under the name of 
millenarianism,576 especially the "intrinsically perverse" political form 
of a secular messianism.577 

677 The Church will enter the glory of the kingdom only through this 
final Passover, when she will follow her Lord in his death and 
Resurrection.578 The kingdom will be fulfilled, then, not by a historic 
triumph of the Church through a progressive ascendancy, but only by 
God's victory over the final unleashing of evil, which will cause his 
Bride to come down from heaven.579 God's triumph over the revolt of 
evil will take the form of the Last Judgement after the final cosmic 
upheaval of this passing world.580

II. To Judge the Living and the Dead 

678 Following in the steps of the prophets and John the Baptist, Jesus 
announced the judgement of the Last Day in his preaching.581 Then 
will the conduct of each one and the secrets of hearts be brought to 
light.582 Then will the culpable unbelief that counted the offer of 
God's grace as nothing be condemned.583 Our attitude to our 



neighbour will disclose acceptance or refusal of grace and divine 
love.584 On the Last Day Jesus will say: "Truly I say to you, as you did 
it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me."585 

679 Christ is Lord of eternal life. Full right to pass definitive 
judgement on the works and hearts of men belongs to him as redeemer 
of the world. He "acquired" this right by his cross. the Father has given 
"all judgement to the Son".586 Yet the Son did not come to judge, but 
to save and to give the life he has in himself.587 By rejecting grace in 
this life, one already judges oneself, receives according to one's works, 
and can even condemn oneself for all eternity by rejecting the Spirit of 
love.588

IN BRIEF 

680 Christ the Lord already reigns through the Church, but all the 
things of this world are not yet subjected to him. the triumph of 
Christ's kingdom will not come about without one last assault by the 
powers of evil. 

681 On Judgement Day at the end of the world, Christ will come in 
glory to achieve the definitive triumph of good over evil which, like the 
wheat and the tares, have grown up together in the course of history. 

682 When he comes at the end of time to judge the living and the 
dead, the glorious Christ will reveal the secret disposition of hearts and 
will render to each man according to his works, and according to his 
acceptance or refusal of grace.

CHAPTER THREE I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT 

683 "No one can say 'Jesus is Lord' except by the Holy Spirit."1 "God 
has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, 'Abba! Father!"'2 
This knowledge of faith is possible only in the Holy Spirit: to be in 
touch with Christ, we must first have been touched by the Holy Spirit. 
He comes to meet us and kindles faith in us. By virtue of our Baptism, 
the first sacrament of the faith, the Holy Spirit in the Church 
communicates to us, intimately and personally, the life that originates 
in the Father and is offered to us in the Son. 

Baptism gives us the grace of new birth in God the Father, through his 
Son, in the Holy Spirit. For those who bear God's Spirit are led to the 
Word, that is, to the Son, and the Son presents them to the Father, and 
the Father confers incorruptibility on them. and it is impossible to see 
God's Son without the Spirit, and no one can approach the Father 
without the Son, for the knowledge of the Father is the Son, and the 
knowledge of God's Son is obtained through the Holy Spirit.3 

684 Through his grace, the Holy Spirit is the first to awaken faith in us 
and to communicate to us the new life, which is to "know the Father 
and the one whom he has sent, Jesus Christ."4 But the Spirit is the last 
of the persons of the Holy Trinity to be revealed. St. Gregory of 
Nazianzus, the Theologian, explains this progression in terms of the 
pedagogy of divine "condescension": 

The Old Testament proclaimed the Father clearly, but the Son more 
obscurely. the New Testament revealed the Son and gave us a glimpse 
of the divinity of the Spirit. Now the Spirit dwells among us and grants 
us a clearer vision of himself. It was not prudent, when the divinity of 
the Father had not yet been confessed, to proclaim the Son openly 
and, when the divinity of the Son was not yet admitted, to add the 
Holy Spirit as an extra burden, to speak somewhat daringly.... By 



advancing and progressing "from glory to glory," the light of the Trinity 
will shine in ever more brilliant rays.5 

685 To believe in the Holy Spirit is to profess that the Holy Spirit is 
one of the persons of the Holy Trinity, consubstantial with the Father 
and the Son: "with the Father and the Son he is worshipped and 
glorified."6 For this reason, the divine mystery of the Holy Spirit was 
already treated in the context of Trinitarian "theology." Here, however, 
we have to do with the Holy Spirit only in the divine "economy." 

686 The Holy Spirit is at work with the Father and the Son from the 
beginning to the completion of the plan for our salvation. But in these 
"end times," ushered in by the Son's redeeming Incarnation, the Spirit 
is revealed and given, recognized and welcomed as a person. Now can 
this divine plan, accomplished in Christ, the firstborn and head of the 
new creation, be embodied in mankind by the outpouring of the Spirit: 
as the Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the 
resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.

687 "No one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of 
God."7 Now God's Spirit, who reveals God, makes known to us 
Christ, his Word, his living Utterance, but the Spirit does not speak of 
himself. the Spirit who "has spoken through the prophets" makes us 
hear the Father's Word, but we do not hear the Spirit himself. We know 
him only in the movement by which he reveals the Word to us and 
disposes us to welcome him in faith. the Spirit of truth who "unveils" 
Christ to us "will not speak on his own."8 Such properly divine self-
effacement explains why "the world cannot receive (him), because it 
neither sees him nor knows him," while those who believe in Christ 
know the Spirit because he dwells with them.9 

688 The Church, a communion living in the faith of the apostles which 
she transmits, is the place where we know the Holy Spirit:  

- in the Scriptures he inspired;  

- in the Tradition, to which the Church Fathers are always timely 
witnesses;  

- in the Church's Magisterium, which he assists;  

- in the sacramental liturgy, through its words and symbols, in which 
the Holy Spirit puts us into communion with Christ;  

- in prayer, wherein he intercedes for us;  

- in the charisms and ministries by which the Church is built up;  

- in the signs of apostolic and missionary life;  

- in the witness of saints through whom he manifests his holiness and 
continues the work of salvation.

I. The Joint Mission of the Son and the Spirit 

689 The One whom the Father has sent into our hearts, the Spirit of 
his Son, is truly God.10 Consubstantial with the Father and the Son, 
the Spirit is inseparable from them, in both the inner life of the Trinity 
and his gift of love for the world. In adoring the Holy Trinity, life-
giving, consubstantial, and indivisible, the Church's faith also professes 
the distinction of persons. When the Father sends his Word, he always 
sends his Breath. In their joint mission, the Son and the Holy Spirit are 
distinct but inseparable. To be sure, it is Christ who is seen, the visible 
image of the invisible God, but it is the Spirit who reveals him. 

690 Jesus is Christ, "anointed," because the Spirit is his anointing, and 
everything that occurs from the Incarnation on derives from this 
fullness.11 When Christ is finally glorified,12 he can in turn send the 
Spirit from his place with the Father to those who believe in him: he 
communicates to them his glory,13 that is, the Holy Spirit who 
glorifies him.14 From that time on, this joint mission will be 
manifested in the children adopted by the Father in the Body of his 
Son: the mission of the Spirit of adoption is to unite them to Christ 
and make them live in him: 

The notion of anointing suggests . . . that there is no distance between 
the Son and the Spirit. Indeed, just as between the surface of the body 
and the anointing with oil neither reason nor sensation recognizes any 
intermediary, so the contact of the Son with the Spirit is immediate, so 
that anyone who would make contact with the Son by faith must first 
encounter the oil by contact. In fact there is no part that is not covered 
by the Holy Spirit. That is why the confession of the Son's Lordship is 
made in the Holy Spirit by those who receive him, the Spirit coming 
from all sides to those who approach the Son in faith.15

II. The Name, Titles, and Symbols of the Holy Spirit 

The proper name of the Holy Spirit 

691 "Holy Spirit" is the proper name of the one whom we adore and 
glorify with the Father and the Son. the Church has received this name 
from the Lord and professes it in the Baptism of her new children.16 

The term "Spirit" translates the Hebrew word ruah, which, in its 
primary sense, means breath, air, wind. Jesus indeed uses the sensory 
image of the wind to suggest to Nicodemus the transcendent newness 
of him who is personally God's breath, the divine Spirit.17 On the 
other hand, "Spirit" and "Holy" are divine attributes common to the 



three divine persons. By joining the two terms, Scripture, liturgy, and 
theological language designate the inexpressible person of the Holy 
Spirit, without any possible equivocation with other uses of the terms 
"spirit" and "holy." 

Titles of the Holy Spirit 

692 When he proclaims and promises the coming of the Holy Spirit, 
Jesus calls him the "Paraclete," literally, "he who is called to one's side," 
advocatus.18 "Paraclete" is commonly translated by "consoler," and 
Jesus is the first consoler.19 The Lord also called the Holy Spirit "the 
Spirit of truth."20 

693 Besides the proper name of "Holy Spirit," which is most 
frequently used in the Acts of the Apostles and in the Epistles, we also 
find in St. Paul the titles: the Spirit of the promise,21 The Spirit of 
adoption,22 The Spirit of Christ,23 The Spirit of the Lord,24 and the 
Spirit of God25 - and, in St. Peter, the Spirit of glory.26 

Symbols of the Holy Spirit 

694 Water. the symbolism of water signifies the Holy Spirit's action in 
Baptism, since after the invocation of the Holy Spirit it becomes the 
efficacious sacramental sign of new birth: just as the gestation of our 
first birth took place in water, so the water of Baptism truly signifies 
that our birth into the divine life is given to us in the Holy Spirit. As 
"by one Spirit we were all baptized," so we are also "made to drink of 
one Spirit."27 Thus the Spirit is also personally the living water welling 
up from Christ crucified28 as its source and welling up in us to eternal 
life.29 

695 Anointing. the symbolism of anointing with oil also signifies the 
Holy Spirit,30 to the point of becoming a synonym for the Holy Spirit. 
In Christian initiation, anointing is the sacramental sign of 
Confirmation, called "chrismation" in the Churches of the East. Its full 
force can be grasped only in relation to the primary anointing 
accomplished by the Holy Spirit, that of Jesus. Christ (in Hebrew 
"messiah") means the one "anointed" by God's Spirit. There were 
several anointed ones of the Lord in the Old Covenant, pre-eminently 
King David.31 But Jesus is God's Anointed in a unique way: the 
humanity the Son assumed was entirely anointed by the Holy Spirit. 



the Holy Spirit established him as "Christ."32 The Virgin Mary 
conceived Christ by the Holy Spirit who, through the angel, 
proclaimed him the Christ at his birth, and prompted Simeon to come 
to the temple to see the Christ of the Lord.33 The Spirit filled Christ 
and the power of the Spirit went out from him in his acts of healing 
and of saving.34 Finally, it was the Spirit who raised Jesus from the 
dead.35 Now, fully established as "Christ" in his humanity victorious 
over death, Jesus pours out the Holy Spirit abundantly until "the 
saints" constitute - in their union with the humanity of the Son of God 
- that perfect man "to the measure of the stature of the fullness of 
Christ":36 "the whole Christ," in St. Augustine's expression. 

696 Fire. While water signifies birth and the fruitfulness of life given in 
the Holy Spirit, fire symbolizes the transforming energy of the Holy 
Spirit's actions. the prayer of the prophet Elijah, who "arose like fire" 
and whose "word burned like a torch," brought down fire from heaven 
on the sacrifice on Mount Carmel.37 This event was a "figure" of the 
fire of the Holy Spirit, who transforms what he touches. John the 
Baptist, who goes "before [the Lord] in the spirit and power of Elijah," 
proclaims Christ as the one who "will baptize you with the Holy Spirit 
and with fire."38 Jesus will say of the Spirit: "I came to cast fire upon 
the earth; and would that it were already kindled!"39 In the form of 
tongues "as of fire," the Holy Spirit rests on the disciples on the 
morning of Pentecost and fills them with himself40 The spiritual 
tradition has retained this symbolism of fire as one of the most 
expressive images of the Holy Spirit's actions.41 "Do not quench the 
Spirit."42 

697 Cloud and light. These two images occur together in the 
manifestations of the Holy Spirit. In the theophanies of the Old 
Testament, the cloud, now obscure, now luminous, reveals the living 
and saving God, while veiling the transcendence of his glory - with 
Moses on Mount Sinai,43 at the tent of meeting,44 and during the 
wandering in the desert,45 and with Solomon at the dedication of the 
Temple.46 In the Holy Spirit, Christ fulfills these figures. the Spirit 
comes upon the Virgin Mary and "overshadows" her, so that she might 
conceive and give birth to Jesus.47 On the mountain of 
Transfiguration, the Spirit in the "cloud came and overshadowed" 
Jesus, Moses and Elijah, Peter, James and John, and "a voice came out 



of the cloud, saying, 'This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!'"48 
Finally, the cloud took Jesus out of the sight of the disciples on the day 
of his ascension and will reveal him as Son of man in glory on the day 
of his final coming.49 

698 The seal is a symbol close to that of anointing. "The Father has set 
his seal" on Christ and also seals us in him.50 Because this seal 
indicates the indelible effect of the anointing with the Holy Spirit in 
the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy Orders, the image 
of the seal (sphragis) has been used in some theological traditions to 
express the indelible "character" imprinted by these three unrepeatable 
sacraments. 

699 The hand. Jesus heals the sick and blesses little children by laying 
hands on them.51 In his name the apostles will do the same.52 Even 
more pointedly, it is by the Apostles' imposition of hands that the Holy 
Spirit is given.53 The Letter to the Hebrews lists the imposition of 
hands among the "fundamental elements" of its teaching.54 The 
Church has kept this sign of the all-powerful outpouring of the Holy 
Spirit in its sacramental epicleses. 

700 The finger. "It is by the finger of God that [Jesus] cast out 
demons."55 If God's law was written on tablets of stone "by the finger 
of God," then the "letter from Christ" entrusted to the care of the 
apostles, is written "with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of 
stone, but on tablets of human hearts."56 The hymn Veni Creator 
Spiritus invokes the Holy Spirit as the "finger of the Father's right 
hand."57 

701 The dove. At the end of the flood, whose symbolism refers to 
Baptism, a dove released by Noah returns with a fresh olive-tree 
branch in its beak as a sign that the earth was again habitable.58 When 
Christ comes up from the water of his baptism, the Holy Spirit, in the 
form of a dove, comes down upon him and remains with him.59 The 
Spirit comes down and remains in the purified hearts of the baptized. 
In certain churches, the Eucharist is reserved in a metal receptacle in 
the form of a dove (columbarium) suspended above the altar. Christian 
iconography traditionally uses a dove to suggest the Spirit.

III. God's Spirit and Word in the Time of the Promises 

702 From the beginning until "the fullness of time,"60 The joint 
mission of the Father's Word and Spirit remains hidden, but it is at 
work. God's Spirit prepares for the time of the Messiah. Neither is fully 
revealed but both are already promised, to be watched for and 
welcomed at their manifestation. So, for this reason, when the Church 
reads the Old Testament, she searches there for what the Spirit, "who 
has spoken through the prophets," wants to tell us about Christ.61 

By "prophets" the faith of the Church here understands all whom the 
Holy Spirit inspired in living proclamation and in the composition of 
the sacred books, both of the Old and the New Testaments. Jewish 
tradition distinguishes first the Law (the five first books or 
Pentateuch), then the Prophets (our historical and prophetic books) 
and finally the Writings (especially the wisdom literature, in particular 
the Psalms).62 

In creation 

703 The Word of God and his Breath are at the origin of the being and 
life of every creature:63 

It belongs to the Holy Spirit to rule, sanctify, and animate creation, for 
he is God, consubstantial with the Father and the Son.... Power over 
life pertains to the Spirit, for being God he preserves creation in the 
Father through the Son.64 

704 "God fashioned man with his own hands [that is, the Son and the 
Holy Spirit] and impressed his own form on the flesh he had 
fashioned, in such a way that even what was visible might bear the 
divine form."65 

The Spirit of the promise 



705 Disfigured by sin and death, man remains "in the image of God," 
in the image of the Son, but is deprived "of the glory of God,"66 of his 
"likeness." the promise made to Abraham inaugurates the economy of 
salvation, at the culmination of which the Son himself will assume that 
"image"67 and restore it in the Father's "likeness" by giving it again its 
Glory, the Spirit who is "the giver of life." 

706 Against all human hope, God promises descendants to Abraham, 
as the fruit of faith and of the power of the Holy Spirit.68 In 
Abraham's progeny all the nations of the earth will be blessed. This 
progeny will be Christ himself,69 in whom the outpouring of the Holy 
Spirit will "gather into one the children of God who are scattered 
abroad."70 God commits himself by his own solemn oath to giving his 
beloved Son and "the promised Holy Spirit . . . [who is] the guarantee 
of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it."71 

In Theophanies and the Law 

707 Theophanies (manifestations of God) light up the way of the 
promise, from the patriarchs to Moses and from Joshua to the visions 
that inaugurated the missions of the great prophets. Christian tradition 
has always recognized that God's Word allowed himself to be seen and 
heard in these theophanies, in which the cloud of the Holy Spirit both 
revealed him and concealed him in its shadow. 

708 This divine pedagogy appears especially in the gift of the Law.72 
God gave the Law as a "pedagogue" to lead his people towards 
Christ.73 But the Law's powerlessness to save man deprived of the 
divine "likeness," along with the growing awareness of sin that it 
imparts,74 enkindles a desire for the Holy Spirit. The lamentations of 
the Psalms bear witness to this. 

In the Kingdom and the Exile 

709 The Law, the sign of God's promise and covenant, ought to have 
governed the hearts and institutions of that people to whom Abraham's 
faith gave birth. "If you will obey my voice and keep my covenant, . . . 
you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation."75 But after 
David, Israel gave in to the temptation of becoming a kingdom like 
other nations. the Kingdom, however, the object of the promise made 



to David,76 would be the work of the Holy Spirit; it would belong to 
the poor according to the Spirit. 

710 The forgetting of the Law and the infidelity to the covenant end in 
death: it is the Exile, apparently the failure of the promises, which is in 
fact the mysterious fidelity of the Savior God and the beginning of a 
promised restoration, but according to the Spirit. the People of God 
had to suffer this purification.77 In God's plan, the Exile already 
stands in the shadow of the Cross, and the Remnant of the poor that 
returns from the Exile is one of the most transparent prefigurations of 
the Church. 

Expectation of the Messiah and his Spirit 

711 "Behold, I am doing a new thing."78 Two prophetic lines were to 
develop, one leading to the expectation of the Messiah, the other 
pointing to the announcement of a new Spirit. They converge in the 
small Remnant, the people of the poor, who await in hope the 
"consolation of Israel" and "the redemption of Jerusalem."79 

We have seen earlier how Jesus fulfills the prophecies concerning 
himself. We limit ourselves here to those in which the relationship of 
the Messiah and his Spirit appears more clearly. 

712 The characteristics of the awaited Messiah begin to appear in the 
"Book of Emmanuel" ("Isaiah said this when he saw his glory,"80 
speaking of Christ), especially in the first two verses of Isaiah 11: 81 

There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, 

and a branch shall grow out of his roots. 

and the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, 

the spirit of wisdom and understanding, 

the spirit of counsel and might, 

the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD. 

713 The Messiah's characteristics are revealed above all in the "Servant 
songs."82 These songs proclaim the meaning of Jesus' Passion and 
show how he will pour out the Holy Spirit to give life to the many: not 



as an outsider, but by embracing our "form as slave."83 Taking our 
death upon himself, he can communicate to us his own Spirit of life. 

714 This is why Christ inaugurates the proclamation of the Good 
News by making his own the following passage from Isaiah:84 

The Spirit of the LORD God is upon me, because the LORD has 
anointed me to bring good tidings to the afflicted; he has sent me to 
bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the 
opening of the prison to those who are bound; to proclaim the year of 
the LORD'S favor. 

715 The prophetic texts that directly concern the sending of the Holy 
Spirit are oracles by which God speaks to the heart of his people in the 
language of the promise, with the accents of "love and fidelity."85 St. 
Peter will proclaim their fulfillment on the morning of Pentecost.86 
According to these promises, at the "end time" the Lord's Spirit will 
renew the hearts of men, engraving a new law in them. He will gather 
and reconcile the scattered and divided peoples; he will transform the 
first creation, and God will dwell there with men in peace. 

716 The People of the "poor"87 - those who, humble and meek, rely 
solely on their God's mysterious plans, who await the justice, not of 
men but of the Messiah - are in the end the great achievement of the 
Holy Spirit's hidden mission during the time of the promises that 
prepare for Christ's coming. It is this quality of heart, purified and 
enlightened by the Spirit, which is expressed in the Psalms. In these 
poor, the Spirit is making ready "a people prepared for the Lord."88

IV. The Spirit of Christ in the Fullness of Time 

John, precursor, prophet, and baptist 

717 "There was a man sent from God, whose name was John."89 John 
was "filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother's womb"90 by 
Christ himself, whom the Virgin Mary had just conceived by the Holy 
Spirit. Mary's visitation to Elizabeth thus became a visit from God to 
his people.91 

718 John is "Elijah (who) must come."92 The fire of the Spirit dwells 
in him and makes him the forerunner of the coming Lord. In John, the 
precursor, the Holy Spirit completes the work of "[making] ready a 
people prepared for the Lord."93 

719 John the Baptist is "more than a prophet."94 In him, the Holy 
Spirit concludes his speaking through the prophets. John completes the 
cycle of prophets begun by Elijah.95 He proclaims the imminence of 
the consolation of Israel; he is the "voice" of the Consoler who is 
coming.96 As the Spirit of truth will also do, John "came to bear 
witness to the light."97 In John's sight, the Spirit thus brings to 
completion the careful search of the prophets and fulfills the longing of 
the angels.98 "He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, 
this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. and I have seen and have 
borne witness that this is the Son of God.... Behold, the Lamb of 
God."99 

720 Finally, with John the Baptist, the Holy Spirit begins the 
restoration to man of "the divine likeness," prefiguring what he would 
achieve with and in Christ. John's baptism was for repentance; baptism 
in water and the Spirit will be a new birth.100 

"Rejoice, you who are full of grace" 

721 Mary, the all-holy ever-virgin Mother of God, is the masterwork of 
the mission of the Son and the Spirit in the fullness of time. For the 



first time in the plan of salvation and because his Spirit had prepared 
her, the Father found the dwelling place where his Son and his Spirit 
could dwell among men. In this sense the Church's Tradition has often 
read the most beautiful texts on wisdom in relation to Mary.101 Mary 
is acclaimed and represented in the liturgy as the "Seat of Wisdom."  

In her, the "wonders of God" that the Spirit was to fulfill in Christ and 
the Church began to be manifested: 

722 The Holy Spirit prepared Mary by his grace. It was fitting that the 
mother of him in whom "the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily"102 
should herself be "full of grace." She was, by sheer grace, conceived 
without sin as the most humble of creatures, the most capable of 
welcoming the inexpressible gift of the Almighty. It was quite correct 
for the angel Gabriel to greet her as the "Daughter of Zion": 
"Rejoice."103 It is the thanksgiving of the whole People of God, and 
thus of the Church, which Mary in her canticle104 lifts up to the 
Father in the Holy Spirit while carrying within her the eternal Son. 

723 In Mary, the Holy Spirit fulfills the plan of the Father's loving 
goodness. Through the Holy Spirit, the Virgin conceives and gives birth 
to the Son of God. By the Holy Spirit's power and her faith, her 
virginity became uniquely fruitful.105 

724 In Mary, the Holy Spirit manifests the Son of the Father, now 
become the Son of the Virgin. She is the burning bush of the definitive 
theophany. Filled with the Holy Spirit she makes the Word visible in 
the humility of his flesh. It is to the poor and the first representatives of 
the gentiles that she makes him known.106 

725 Finally, through Mary, the Holy Spirit begins to bring men, the 
objects of God's merciful love,107 into communion with Christ. and 
the humble are always the first to accept him: shepherds, magi, Simeon 
and Anna, the bride and groom at Cana, and the first disciples. 

726 At the end of this mission of the Spirit, Mary became the Woman, 
the new Eve ("mother of the living"), the mother of the "whole 
Christ."108 As such, she was present with the Twelve, who "with one 
accord devoted themselves to prayer,"109 at the dawn of the "end 
time" which the Spirit was to inaugurate on the morning of Pentecost 
with the manifestation of the Church. 



Christ Jesus 

727 The entire mission of the Son and the Holy Spirit, in the fullness 
of time, is contained in this: that the Son is the one anointed by the 
Father's Spirit since his Incarnation - Jesus is the Christ, the Messiah.  

Everything in the second chapter of the Creed is to be read in this 
light. Christ's whole work is in fact a joint mission of the Son and the 
Holy Spirit. Here, we shall mention only what has to do with Jesus' 
promise of the Holy Spirit and the gift of him by the glorified Lord. 

728 Jesus does not reveal the Holy Spirit fully, until he himself has 
been glorified through his Death and Resurrection. Nevertheless, little 
by little he alludes to him even in his teaching of the multitudes, as 
when he reveals that his own flesh will be food for the life of the 
world.110 He also alludes to the Spirit in speaking to Nicodemus,111 
to the Samaritan woman,112 and to those who take part in the feast of 
Tabernacles.113 To his disciples he speaks openly of the Spirit in 
connection with prayer114 and with the witness they will have to 
bear.115 

729 Only when the hour has arrived for his glorification does Jesus 
promise the coming of the Holy Spirit, since his Death and 
Resurrection will fulfill the promise made to the fathers.116 The Spirit 
of truth, the other Paraclete, will be given by the Father in answer to 
Jesus' prayer; he will be sent by the Father in Jesus' name; and Jesus 
will send him from the Father's side, since he comes from the Father. 
the Holy Spirit will come and we shall know him; he will be with us for 
ever; he will remain with us. the Spirit will teach us everything, remind 
us of all that Christ said to us and bear witness to him. the Holy Spirit 
will lead us into all truth and will glorify Christ. He will prove the 
world wrong about sin, righteousness, and judgment. 

730 At last Jesus' hour arrives:117 he commends his spirit into the 
Father's hands118 at the very moment when by his death he conquers 
death, so that, "raised from the dead by the glory of the Father,"119 he 
might immediately give the Holy Spirit by "breathing" on his 
disciples.120 From this hour onward, the mission of Christ and the 
Spirit becomes the mission of the Church: "As the Father has sent me, 
even so I send you."121

V. The Spirit and the Church In the Last Days 

Pentecost 

731 On the day of Pentecost when the seven weeks of Easter had come 
to an end, Christ's Passover is fulfilled in the outpouring of the Holy 
Spirit, manifested, given, and communicated as a divine person: of his 
fullness, Christ, the Lord, pours out the Spirit in abundance.122 



732 On that day, the Holy Trinity is fully revealed. Since that day, the 
Kingdom announced by Christ has been open to those who believe in 
him: in the humility of the flesh and in faith, they already share in the 
communion of the Holy Trinity. By his coming, which never ceases, the 
Holy Spirit causes the world to enter into the "last days," the time of 
the Church, the Kingdom already inherited though not yet 
consummated. 

We have seen the true Light, we have received the heavenly Spirit, we 
have found the true faith: we adore the indivisible Trinity, who has 
saved us.123 

The Holy Spirit - God's gift 

733 "God is Love"124 and love is his first gift, containing all others. 
"God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit 
who has been given to us."125 

734 Because we are dead or at least wounded through sin, the first 
effect of the gift of love is the forgiveness of our sins. the communion 
of the Holy Spirit126 in the Church restores to the baptized the divine 
likeness lost through sin. 

735 He, then, gives us the "pledge" or "first fruits" of our inheritance: 
the very life of the Holy Trinity, which is to love as "God (has) loved 
us."127 This love (the "charity" of 1 Cor 13) is the source of the new 
life in Christ, made possible because we have received "power" from 
the Holy Spirit.128 

736 By this power of the Spirit, God's children can bear much fruit. 
He who has grafted us onto the true vine will make us bear "the fruit 
of the Spirit: . . . love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, 
faithfulness, gentleness, self-control."129 "We live by the Spirit"; the 
more we renounce ourselves, the more we "walk by the Spirit."130 

Through the Holy Spirit we are restored to paradise, led back to the 
Kingdom of heaven, and adopted as children, given confidence to call 
God "Father" and to share in Christ's grace, called children of light 
and given a share in eternal glory.131 

The Holy Spirit and the Church 



737 The mission of Christ and the Holy Spirit is brought to 
completion in the Church, which is the Body of Christ and the Temple 
of the Holy Spirit. This joint mission henceforth brings Christ's faithful 
to share in his communion with the Father in the Holy Spirit. the 
Spirit prepares men and goes out to them with his grace, in order to 
draw them to Christ. the Spirit manifests the risen Lord to them, 
recalls his word to them and opens their minds to the understanding of 
his Death and Resurrection. He makes present the mystery of Christ, 
supremely in the Eucharist, in order to reconcile them, to bring them 
into communion with God, that they may "bear much fruit."132 

738 Thus the Church's mission is not an addition to that of Christ and 
the Holy Spirit, but is its sacrament: in her whole being and in all her 
members, the Church is sent to announce, bear witness, make present, 
and spread the mystery of the communion of the Holy Trinity (the 
topic of the next article): 

All of us who have received one and the same Spirit, that is, the Holy 
Spirit, are in a sense blended together with one another and with God. 
For if Christ, together with the Father's and his own Spirit, comes to 
dwell in each of us, though we are many, still the Spirit is one and 
undivided. He binds together the spirits of each and every one of us, . . 
. and makes all appear as one in him. For just as the power of Christ's 
sacred flesh unites those in whom it dwells into one body, I think that 
in the same way the one and undivided Spirit of God, who dwells in 
all, leads all into spiritual unity.133 

739 Because the Holy Spirit is the anointing of Christ, it is Christ who, 
as the head of the Body, pours out the Spirit among his members to 
nourish, heal, and organize them in their mutual functions, to give 
them life, send them to bear witness, and associate them to his self-
offering to the Father and to his intercession for the whole world. 
Through the Church's sacraments, Christ communicates his Holy and 
sanctifying Spirit to the members of his Body. (This will be the topic of 
Part Two of the Catechism.) 

740 These "mighty works of God," offered to believers in the 
sacraments of the Church, bear their fruit in the new life in Christ, 
according to the Spirit. (This will be the topic of Part Three.) 



741 "The Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to 
pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes with sighs too deep 
for words."134 The Holy Spirit, the artisan of God's works, is the 
master of prayer. (This will be the topic of Part Four.)

IN BRIEF 

742 "Because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our 
hearts, crying, 'Abba! Father!"' (Gal 4:6). 

743 From the beginning to the end of time, whenever God sends his 
Son, he always sends his Spirit: their mission is conjoined and 
inseparable. 

744 In the fullness of time the Holy Spirit completes in Mary all the 
preparations for Christ's coming among the People of God. By the 
action of the Holy Spirit in her, the Father gives the world Emmanuel 
"God-with-us" (Mt 1:23). 



745 The Son of God was consecrated as Christ (Messiah) by the 
anointing of the Holy Spirit at his Incarnation (cf Ps 2:6-7). 

746 By his Death and his Resurrection, Jesus is constituted in glory as 
Lord and Christ (cf Acts 2:36). From his fullness, he poured out the 
Holy Spirit on the apostles and the Church. 

747 The Holy Spirit, whom Christ the head pours out on his members, 
builds, animates, and sanctifies the Church. She is the sacrament of the 
Holy Trinity's communion with men.

Article 9 "I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH" 

748 "Christ is the light of humanity; and it is, accordingly, the heart-
felt desire of this sacred Council, being gathered together in the Holy 
Spirit, that, by proclaiming his Gospel to every creature, it may bring 
to all men that light of Christ which shines out visibly from the 
Church."135 These words open the Second Vatican Council's 
Dogmatic Constitution on the Church. By choosing this starting point, 
the Council demonstrates that the article of faith about the Church 
depends entirely on the articles concerning Christ Jesus. the Church 
has no other light than Christ's; according to a favorite image of the 
Church Fathers, the Church is like the moon, all its light reflected 
from the sun. 

749 The article concerning the Church also depends entirely on the 
article about the Holy Spirit, which immediately precedes it. "Indeed, 
having shown that the Spirit is the source and giver of all holiness, we 
now confess that it is he who has endowed the Church with 
holiness."136 The Church is, in a phrase used by the Fathers, the place 
"where the Spirit flourishes."137 

750 To believe that the Church is "holy" and "catholic," and that she is 
"one" and "apostolic" (as the Nicene Creed adds), is inseparable from 
belief in God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In the Apostles' 
Creed we profess "one Holy Church" (Credo . . . Ecclesiam), and not 
to believe in the Church, so as not to confuse God with his works and 
to attribute clearly to God's goodness all the gifts he has bestowed on 
his Church.138

Paragraph 1. THE CHURCH IN GOD'S PLAN 

I. NAMES AND IMAGES OF THE CHURCH 

751 The word "Church" (Latin ecclesia, from the Greek ek-ka-lein, to 
"call out of") means a convocation or an assembly. It designates the 
assemblies of the people, usually for a religious purpose.139 Ekklesia is 
used frequently in the Greek Old Testament for the assembly of the 
Chosen People before God, above all for their assembly on Mount 
Sinai where Israel received the Law and was established by God as his 
holy people.140 By calling itself "Church," the first community of 
Christian believers recognized itself as heir to that assembly. In the 
Church, God is "calling together" his people from all the ends of the 
earth. the equivalent Greek term Kyriake, from which the English 
word Church and the German Kirche are derived, means "what 
belongs to the Lord." 

752 In Christian usage, the word "church" designates the liturgical 
assembly,141 but also the local community142 or the whole universal 
community of believers.143 These three meanings are inseparable. 
"The Church" is the People that God gathers in the whole world. She 
exists in local communities and is made real as a liturgical, above all a 
Eucharistic, assembly. She draws her life from the word and the Body 
of Christ and so herself becomes Christ's Body. 



Symbols of the Church 

753 In Scripture, we find a host of interrelated images and figures 
through which Revelation speaks of the inexhaustible mystery of the 
Church. the images taken from the Old Testament are variations on a 
profound theme: the People of God. In the New Testament, all these 
images find a new center because Christ has become the head of this 
people, which henceforth is his Body.144 Around this center are 
grouped images taken "from the life of the shepherd or from 
cultivation of the land, from the art of building or from family life and 
marriage."145 

754 "The Church is, accordingly, a sheepfold, the sole and necessary 
gateway to which is Christ. It is also the flock of which God himself 
foretold that he would be the shepherd, and whose sheep, even though 
governed by human shepherds, are unfailingly nourished and led by 
Christ himself, the Good Shepherd and Prince of Shepherds, who gave 
his life for his sheep.146 

755 "The Church is a cultivated field, the tillage of God. On that land 
the ancient olive tree grows whose holy roots were the prophets and in 
which the reconciliation of Jews and Gentiles has been brought about 
and will be brought about again. That land, like a choice vineyard, has 
been planted by the heavenly cultivator. Yet the true vine is Christ who 
gives life and fruitfulness to the branches, that is, to us, who through 
the Church remain in Christ, without whom we can do nothing.147 

756 "Often, too, the Church is called the building of God. the Lord 
compared himself to the stone which the builders rejected, but which 
was made into the comer-stone. On this foundation the Church is built 
by the apostles and from it the Church receives solidity and unity. This 
edifice has many names to describe it: the house of God in which his 
family dwells; the household of God in the Spirit; the dwelling-place of 
God among men; and, especially, the holy temple. This temple, 
symbolized in places of worship built out of stone, is praised by the 
Fathers and, not without reason, is compared in the liturgy to the Holy 
City, the New Jerusalem. As living stones we here on earth are built 
into it. It is this holy city that is seen by John as it comes down out of 
heaven from God when the world is made anew, prepared like a bride 
adorned for her husband.148 



757 "The Church, further, which is called 'that Jerusalem which is 
above' and 'our mother', is described as the spotless spouse of the 
spotless lamb. It is she whom Christ 'loved and for whom he delivered 
himself up that he might sanctify her.' It is she whom he unites to 
himself by an unbreakable alliance, and whom he constantly 'nourishes 
and cherishes.'"149 

II. THE CHURCH'S ORIGIN, FOUNDATION AND MISSION 

758 We begin our investigation of the Church's mystery by meditating 
on her origin in the Holy Trinity's plan and her progressive realization 
in history. 

A plan born in the Father's heart 

759 "The eternal Father, in accordance with the utterly gratuitous and 
mysterious design of his wisdom and goodness, created the whole 
universe and chose to raise up men to share in his own divine life,"150 
to which he calls all men in his Son. "The Father . . . determined to 
call together in a holy Church those who should believe in Christ."151 
This "family of God" is gradually formed and takes shape during the 
stages of human history, in keeping with the Father's plan. In fact, 
"already present in figure at the beginning of the world, this Church 
was prepared in marvellous fashion in the history of the people of 
Israel and the old Advance. Established in this last age of the world 
and made manifest in the utpouring of the Spirit, it will be brought to 
glorious completion at the end of time."152 

The Church - foreshadowed from the world's beginning 

760 Christians of the first centuries said, "The world was created for 
the sake of the Church."153 God created the world for the sake of 
communion with his divine life, a communion brought about by the 
"convocation" of men in Christ, and this "convocation" is the Church. 
the Church is the goal of all things,154 and God permitted such 
painful upheavals as the angels' fall and man's sin only as occasions and 
means for displaying all the power of his arm and the whole measure of 
the love he wanted to give the world: 

Just as God's will is creation and is called "the world," so his intention 
is the salvation of men, and it is called "the Church."155 



The Church - prepared for in the Old Covenant 

761 The gathering together of the People of God began at the moment 
when sin destroyed the communion of men with God, and that of men 
among themselves. the gathering together of the Church is, as it were, 
God's reaction to the chaos provoked by sin. This reunification is 
achieved secretly in the heart of all peoples: "In every nation anyone 
who fears him and does what is right is acceptable" to God.156 

762 The remote preparation for this gathering together of the People of 
God begins when he calls Abraham and promises that he will become 
the father of a great people.157 Its immediate preparation begins with 
Israel's election as the People of God. By this election, Israel is to be 
the sign of the future gathering of All nations.158 But the prophets 
accuse Israel of breaking the covenant and behaving like a prostitute. 
They announce a new and eternal covenant. "Christ instituted this 
New Covenant."159 

The Church - instituted by Christ Jesus 

763 It was the Son's task to accomplish the Father's plan of salvation in 
the fullness of time. Its accomplishment was the reason for his being 
sent.160 "The Lord Jesus inaugurated his Church by preaching the 
Good News, that is, the coming of the Reign of God, promised over 
the ages in the scriptures."161 To fulfill the Father's will, Christ 
ushered in the Kingdom of heaven on earth. the Church "is the Reign 
of Christ already present in mystery."162 

764 "This Kingdom shines out before men in the word, in the works 
and in the presence of Christ."163 To welcome Jesus' word is to 
welcome "the Kingdom itself."164 The seed and beginning of the 
Kingdom are the "little flock" of those whom Jesus came to gather 
around him, the flock whose shepherd he is.165 They form Jesus' true 
family.166 To those whom he thus gathered around him, he taught a 
new "way of acting" and a prayer of their own.167 

765 The Lord Jesus endowed his community with a structure that will 
remain until the Kingdom is fully achieved. Before all else there is the 
choice of the Twelve with Peter as their head.168 Representing the 
twelve tribes of Israel, they are the foundation stones of the new 
Jerusalem.169 The Twelve and the other disciples share in Christ's 



mission and his power, but also in his lot.170 By all his actions, Christ 
prepares and builds his Church. 

766 The Church is born primarily of Christ's total self-giving for our 
salvation, anticipated in the institution of the Eucharist and fulfilled on 
the cross. "The origin and growth of the Church are symbolized by the 
blood and water which flowed from the open side of the crucified 
Jesus."171 "For it was from the side of Christ as he slept the sleep of 
death upon the cross that there came forth the 'wondrous sacrament of 
the whole Church.'"172 As Eve was formed from the sleeping Adam's 
side, so the Church was born from the pierced heart of Christ hanging 
dead on the cross.173 

The Church - revealed by the Holy Spirit 

767 "When the work which the Father gave the Son to do on earth was 
accomplished, the Holy Spirit was sent on the day of Pentecost in 
order that he might continually sanctify the Church."174 Then "the 
Church was openly displayed to the crowds and the spread of the 
Gospel among the nations, through preaching, was begun."175 As the 
"convocation" of all men for salvation, the Church in her very nature is 
missionary, sent by Christ to all the nations to make disciples of 
them.176 

768 So that she can fulfill her mission, the Holy Spirit "bestows upon 
[the Church] varied hierarchic and charismatic gifts, and in this way 
directs her."177 "Henceforward the Church, endowed with the gifts of 
her founder and faithfully observing his precepts of charity, humility 
and self-denial, receives the mission of proclaiming and establishing 
among all peoples the Kingdom of Christ and of God, and she is on 
earth the seed and the beginning of that kingdom."178 

The Church - perfected in glory 

769 "The Church . . . will receive its perfection only in the glory of 
heaven,"179 at the time of Christ's glorious return. Until that day, "the 
Church progresses on her pilgrimage amidst this world's persecutions 
and God's consolations."180 Here below she knows that she is in exile 
far from the Lord, and longs for the full coming of the Kingdom, when 
she will "be united in glory with her king."181 The Church, and 
through her the world, will not be perfected in glory without great 



trials. Only then will "all the just from the time of Adam, 'from Abel, 
the just one, to the last of the elect,' . . . be gathered together in the 
universal Church in the Father's presence."182 

III. THE MYSTERY OF THE CHURCH 

770 The Church is in history, but at the same time she transcends it. It 
is only "with the eyes of faith"183 that one can see her in her visible 
reality and at the same time in her spiritual reality as bearer of divine 
life. 

The Church - both visible and spiritual 

771 "The one mediator, Christ, established and ever sustains here on 
earth his holy Church, the community of faith, hope, and charity, as a 
visible organization through which he communicates truth and grace 
to all men."184 The Church is at the same time:  
 

- a "society structured with hierarchical organs and the mystical body 
of Christ;  

- the visible society and the spiritual community;  

- the earthly Church and the Church endowed with heavenly 
riches."185  

These dimensions together constitute "one complex reality which 
comes together from a human and a divine element":186 

The Church is essentially both human and divine, visible but endowed 
with invisible realities, zealous in action and dedicated to 
contemplation, present in the world, but as a pilgrim, so constituted 
that in her the human is directed toward and subordinated to the 
divine, the visible to the invisible, action to contemplation, and this 
present world to that city yet to come, the object of our quest.187 

O humility! O sublimity! Both tabernacle of cedar and sanctuary of 
God; earthly dwelling and celestial palace; house of clay and royal hall; 
body of death and temple of light; and at last both object of scorn to 
the proud and bride of Christ! She is black but beautiful, O daughters 
of Jerusalem, for even if the labor and pain of her long exile may have 
discolored her, yet heaven's beauty has adorned her.188 



The Church - mystery of men's union with God 

772 It is in the Church that Christ fulfills and reveals his own mystery 
as the purpose of God's plan: "to unite all things in him."189 St. Paul 
calls the nuptial union of Christ and the Church "a great mystery." 
Because she is united to Christ as to her bridegroom, she becomes a 
mystery in her turn.190 Contemplating this mystery in her, Paul 
exclaims: "Christ in you, the hope of glory."191 

773 In the Church this communion of men with God, in the "love 
[that] never ends," is the purpose which governs everything in her that 
is a sacramental means, tied to this passing world.192  

"[The Church's] structure is totally ordered to the holiness of Christ's 
members. and holiness is measured according to the 'great mystery' in 
which the Bride responds with the gift of love to the gift of the 
Bridegroom."193 Mary goes before us all in the holiness that is the 
Church's mystery as "the bride without spot or wrinkle."194 This is 
why the "Marian" dimension of the Church precedes the "Petrine."195 

The universal Sacrament of Salvation 

774 The Greek word mysterion was translated into Latin by two terms: 
mystenum and sacramentum. In later usage the term sacramentum 
emphasizes the visible sign of the hidden reality of salvation which was 
indicated by the term mystenum. In this sense, Christ himself is the 
mystery of salvation: "For there is no other mystery of God, except 
Christ."196 The saving work of his holy and sanctifying humanity is 
the sacrament of salvation, which is revealed and active in the Church's 
sacraments (which the Eastern Churches also call "the holy 
mysteries"). the seven sacraments are the signs and instruments by 
which the Holy Spirit spreads the grace of Christ the head throughout 
the Church which is his Body. the Church, then, both contains and 
communicates the invisible grace she signifies. It is in this analogical 
sense, that the Church is called a "sacrament." 

775 "The Church, in Christ, is like a sacrament - a sign and 
instrument, that is, of communion with God and of unity among all 
men."197 The Church's first purpose is to be the sacrament of the 
inner union of men with God. Because men's communion with one 
another is rooted in that union with God, the Church is also the 



sacrament of the unity of the human race. In her, this unity is already 
begun, since she gathers men "from every nation, from all tribes and 
peoples and tongues";198 at the same time, the Church is the "sign 
and instrument" of the full realization of the unity yet to come. 

776 As sacrament, the Church is Christ's instrument. "She is taken up 
by him also as the instrument for the salvation of all," "the universal 
sacrament of salvation," by which Christ is "at once manifesting and 
actualizing the mystery of God's love for men."199 The Church "is the 
visible plan of God's love for humanity," because God desires "that the 
whole human race may become one People of God, form one Body of 
Christ, and be built up into one temple of the Holy Spirit."200 

IN BRIEF 

777 The word "Church" means "convocation." It designates the 
assembly of those whom God's Word "convokes," i.e., gathers together 
to form the People of God, and who themselves, nourished with the 
Body of Christ, become the Body of Christ. 

778 The Church is both the means and the goal of God's plan: 
prefigured in creation, prepared for in the Old Covenant, founded by 
the words and actions of Jesus Christ, fulfilled by his redeeming cross 
and his Resurrection, the Church has been manifested as the mystery 
of salvation by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. She will be perfected 
in the glory of heaven as the assembly of all the redeemed of the earth 
(cf Rev 14:4). 

779 The Church is both visible and spiritual, a hierarchical society and 
the Mystical Body of Christ. She is one, yet formed of two 
components, human and divine. That is her mystery, which only faith 
can accept. 

780 The Church in this world is the sacrament of salvation, the sign 
and the instrument of the communion of God and men.

Article 9 "I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH" 

 

 

Paragraph 2. THE CHURCH - PEOPLE OF GOD, BODY OF 
CHRIST, TEMPLE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT 

I. THE CHURCH - PEOPLE OF GOD 

781 "At all times and in every race, anyone who fears God and does 
what is right has been acceptable to him. He has, however, willed to 
make men holy and save them, not as individuals without any bond or 
link between them, but rather to make them into a people who might 
acknowledge him and serve him in holiness. He therefore chose the 
Israelite race to be his own people and established a covenant with it. 
He gradually instructed this people.... All these things, however, 
happened as a preparation for and figure of that new and perfect 
covenant which was to be ratified in Christ . . . the New Covenant in 
his blood; he called together a race made up of Jews and Gentiles 
which would be one, not according to the flesh, but in the Spirit."201 

Characteristics of the People of Got 

782 The People of God is marked by characteristics that clearly 
distinguish it from all other religious, ethnic, political, or cultural 
groups found in history:  

- It is the People of God: God is not the property of any one people. 
But he acquired a people for himself from those who previously were 
not a people: "a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation."202  

- One becomes a member of this people not by a physical birth, but by 
being "born anew," a birth "of water and the Spirit,"203 that is, by 
faith in Christ, and Baptism.  



- This People has for its Head Jesus the Christ (the anointed, the 
Messiah). Because the same anointing, the Holy Spirit, flows from the 
head into the body, this is "the messianic people."  

- "The status of this people is that of the dignity and freedom of the 
sons of God, in whose hearts the Holy Spirit dwells as in a temple."  

- "Its law is the new commandment to love as Christ loved us."204 
This is the "new" law of the Holy Spirit.205  

- Its mission is to be salt of the earth and light of the world.206 This 
people is "a most sure seed of unity, hope, and salvation for the whole 
human race."  

-Its destiny, finally, "is the Kingdom of God which has been begun by 
God himself on earth and which must be further extended until it has 
been brought to perfection by him at the end of time."207 

A priestly, prophetic, and royal people 

783 Jesus Christ is the one whom the Father anointed with the Holy 
Spirit and established as priest, prophet, and king. the whole People of 
God participates in these three offices of Christ and bears the 
responsibilities for mission and service that flow from them.208 

784 On entering the People of God through faith and Baptism, one 
receives a share in this people's unique, priestly vocation: "Christ the 
Lord, high priest taken from among men, has made this new people 'a 
kingdom of priests to God, his Father.' the baptized, by regeneration 
and the anointing of the Holy Spirit, are consecrated to be a spiritual 
house and a holy priesthood."209 

785 "The holy People of God shares also in Christ's prophetic office," 
above all in the supernatural sense of faith that belongs to the whole 
People, lay and clergy, when it "unfailingly adheres to this faith . . . 
once for all delivered to the saints,"210 and when it deepens its 
understanding and becomes Christ's witness in the midst of this world. 

786 Finally, the People of God shares in the royal office of Christ. He 
exercises his kingship by drawing all men to himself through his death 
and Resurrection.211 Christ, King and Lord of the universe, made 
himself the servant of all, for he came "not to be served but to serve, 



and to give his life as a ransom for many."212 For the Christian, "to 
reign is to serve him," particularly when serving "the poor and the 
suffering, in whom the Church recognizes the image of her poor and 
suffering founder."213 The People of God fulfills its royal dignity by a 
life in keeping with its vocation to serve with Christ. 

The sign of the cross makes kings of all those reborn in Christ and the 
anointing of the Holy Spirit consecrates them as priests, so that, apart 
from the particular service of our ministry, all spiritual and rational 
Christians are recognized as members of this royal race and sharers in 
Christ's priestly office. What, indeed, is as royal for a soul as to govern 
the body in obedience to God? and what is as priestly as to dedicate a 
pure conscience to the Lord and to offer the spotless offerings of 
devotion on the altar of the heart?214 

II. THE CHURCH - BODY OF CHRIST 

The Church is communion with Jesus 

787 From the beginning, Jesus associated his disciples with his own 
life, revealed the mystery of the Kingdom to them, and gave them a 
share in his mission, joy, and sufferings.215 Jesus spoke of a still more 
intimate communion between him and those who would follow him: 
"Abide in me, and I in you.... I am the vine, you are the branches."216 
and he proclaimed a mysterious and real communion between his own 
body and ours: "He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in 
me, and I in him."217 

788 When his visible presence was taken from them, Jesus did not leave 
his disciples orphans. He promised to remain with them until the end 
of time; he sent them his Spirit.218 As a result communion with Jesus 
has become, in a way, more intense: "By communicating his Spirit, 
Christ mystically constitutes as his body those brothers of his who are 
called together from every nation."219 

789 The comparison of the Church with the body casts light on the 
intimate bond between Christ and his Church. Not only is she 
gathered around him; she is united in him, in his body. Three aspects 
of the Church as the Body of Christ are to be more specifically noted: 
the unity of all her members with each other as a result of their union 



with Christ; Christ as head of the Body; and the Church as bride of 
Christ. 

"One Body" 

790 Believers who respond to God's word and become members of 
Christ's Body, become intimately united with him: "In that body the 
life of Christ is communicated to those who believe, and who, through 
the sacraments, are united in a hidden and real way to Christ in his 
Passion and glorification."220 This is especially true of Baptism, which 
unites us to Christ's death and Resurrection, and the Eucharist, by 
which "really sharing in the body of the Lord, . . . we are taken up into 
communion with him and with one another."221 

791 The body's unity does not do away with the diversity of its 
members: "In the building up of Christ's Body there is engaged a 
diversity of members and functions. There is only one Spirit who, 
according to his own richness and the needs of the ministries, gives his 
different gifts for the welfare of the Church."222 The unity of the 
Mystical Body produces and stimulates charity among the faithful: 
"From this it follows that if one member suffers anything, all the 
members suffer with him, and if one member is honored, all the 
members together rejoice."223 Finally, the unity of the Mystical Body 
triumphs over all human divisions: "For as many of you as were 
baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor 
Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; 
for you are all one in Christ Jesus."224 

"Christ is the Head of this Body" 

792 Christ "is the head of the body, the Church."225 He is the 
principle of creation and redemption. Raised to the Father's glory, "in 
everything he (is) preeminent,"226 especially in the Church, through 
whom he extends his reign over all things. 

793 Christ unites us with his Passover: all his members must strive to 
resemble him, "until Christ be formed" in them.227 "For this reason 
we . . . are taken up into the mysteries of his life, . . . associated with his 
sufferings as the body with its head, suffering with him, that with him 
we may be glorified."228 



794 Christ provides for our growth: to make us grow toward him, our 
head,229 he provides in his Body, the Church, the gifts and assistance 
by which we help one another along the way of salvation. 

795 Christ and his Church thus together make up the "whole Christ" 
(Christus totus). the Church is one with Christ. the saints are acutely 
aware of this unity: 

Let us rejoice then and give thanks that we have become not only 
Christians, but Christ himself. Do you understand and grasp, brethren, 
God's grace toward us? Marvel and rejoice: we have become Christ. 
For if he is the head, we are the members; he and we together are the 
whole man.... the fullness of Christ then is the head and the members. 
But what does "head and members" mean? Christ and the Church.230 

Our redeemer has shown himself to be one person with the holy 
Church whom he has taken to himself.231 

Head and members form as it were one and the same mystical 
person.232 

A reply of St. Joan of Arc to her judges sums up the faith of the holy 
doctors and the good sense of the believer: "About Jesus Christ and the 
Church, I simply know they're just one thing, and we shouldn't 
complicate the matter."233 

The Church is the Bride of Christ 

796 The unity of Christ and the Church, head and members of one 
Body, also implies the distinction of the two within a personal 
relationship. This aspect is often expressed by the image of bridegroom 
and bride. the theme of Christ as Bridegroom of the Church was 
prepared for by the prophets and announced by John the Baptist.234 
The Lord referred to himself as the "bridegroom."235 The Apostle 
speaks of the whole Church and of each of the faithful, members of his 
Body, as a bride "betrothed" to Christ the Lord so as to become but 
one spirit with him.236 The Church is the spotless bride of the spotless 
Lamb.237 "Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for her, that 
he might sanctify her."238 He has joined her with himself in an 
everlasting covenant and never stops caring for her as for his own 
body:239 



This is the whole Christ, head and body, one formed from many . . . 
whether the head or members speak, it is Christ who speaks. He speaks 
in his role as the head (ex persona capitis) and in his role as body (ex 
persona corporis). What does this mean? "The two will become one 
flesh. This is a great mystery, and I am applying it to Christ and the 
Church."240 and the Lord himself says in the Gospel: "So they are no 
longer two, but one flesh."241 They are, in fact, two different persons, 
yet they are one in the conjugal union, . . . as head, he calls himself the 
bridegroom, as body, he calls himself "bride."242 

III. THE CHURCH IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT 

797 "What the soul is to the human body, the Holy Spirit is to the 
Body of Christ, which is the Church."243 "To this Spirit of Christ, as 
an invisible principle, is to be ascribed the fact that all the parts of the 
body are joined one with the other and with their exalted head; for the 
whole Spirit of Christ is in the head, the whole Spirit is in the body, 
and the whole Spirit is in each of the members."244 The Holy Spirit 
makes the Church "the temple of the living God":245 

Indeed, it is to the Church herself that the "Gift of God" has been 
entrusted.... In it is in her that communion with Christ has been 
deposited, that is to say: the Holy Spirit, the pledge of incorruptibility, 
the strengthening of our faith and the ladder of our ascent to God.... 
For where the Church is, there also is God's Spirit; where God's Spirit 
is, there is the Church and every grace.246 

798 The Holy Spirit is "the principle of every vital and truly saving 
action in each part of the Body."247 He works in many ways to build 
up the whole Body in charity:248 by God's Word "which is able to 
build you up";249 by Baptism, through which he forms Christ's 
Body;250 by the sacraments, which give growth and healing to Christ's 
members; by "the grace of the apostles, which holds first place among 
his gifts";251 by the virtues, which make us act according to what is 
good; finally, by the many special graces (called "charisms"), by which 
he makes the faithful "fit and ready to undertake various tasks and 
offices for the renewal and building up of the Church."252 

Charisms 



799 Whether extraordinary or simple and humble, charisms are graces 
of the Holy Spirit which directly or indirectly benefit the Church, 
ordered as they are to her building up, to the good of men, and to the 
needs of the world. 

800 Charisms are to be accepted with gratitude by the person who 
receives them and by all members of the Church as well. They are a 
wonderfully rich grace for the apostolic vitality and for the holiness of 
the entire Body of Christ, provided they really are genuine gifts of the 
Holy Spirit and are used in full conformity with authentic promptings 
of this same Spirit, that is, in keeping with charity, the true measure of 
all charisms.253 

801 It is in this sense that discernment of charisms is always necessary. 
No charism is exempt from being referred and submitted to the 
Church's shepherds. "Their office (is) not indeed to extinguish the 
Spirit, but to test all things and hold fast to what is good,"254 so that 
all the diverse and complementary charisms work together "for the 
common good."255 

IN BRIEF 

802 Christ Jesus "gave himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity 
and to purify for himself a people of his own" (Titus 2:14). 

803 "You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's 
own people" (1 Pet 2:9). 

804 One enters into the People of God by faith and Baptism. "All men 
are called to belong to the new People of God" (LG 13), so that, in 
Christ, "men may form one family and one People of God" (AG 1). 

805 The Church is the Body of Christ. Through the Spirit and his 
action in the sacraments, above all the Eucharist, Christ, who once was 
dead and is now risen, establishes the community of believers as his 
own Body. 

806 In the unity of this Body, there is a diversity of members and 
functions. All members are linked to one another, especially to those 
who are suffering, to the poor and persecuted. 



807 The Church is this Body of which Christ is the head: she lives 
from him, in him, and for him; he lives with her and in her. 

808 The Church is the Bride of Christ: he loved her and handed 
himself over for her. He has purified her by his blood and made her the 
fruitful mother of all God's children. 

809 The Church is the Temple of the Holy Spirit. the Spirit is the soul, 
as it were, of the Mystical Body, the source of its life, of its unity in 
diversity, and of the riches of its gifts and charisms. 

810 "Hence the universal Church is seen to be 'a people brought into 
unity from the unity of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit'" (LG 
4 citing St. Cyprian, De Dom. orat. 23: PL 4, 553).

PART ONE: THE PROFESSION OF FAITH 

 

 

 

SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS 

 

 

 

CHAPTER THREE I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT 

 

 

 

Article 9 "I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH" 

 

 

Paragraph 3. THE CHURCH IS ONE, HOLY, CATHOLIC, AND 
APOSTOLIC 

811 "This is the sole Church of Christ, which in the Creed we profess 
to be one, holy, catholic and apostolic."256 These four characteristics, 
inseparably linked with each other,257 indicate essential features of the 
Church and her mission. the Church does not possess them of herself; 
it is Christ who, through the Holy Spirit, makes his Church one, holy, 



catholic, and apostolic, and it is he who calls her to realize each of 
these qualities. 

812 Only faith can recognize that the Church possesses these 
properties from her divine source. But their historical manifestations 
are signs that also speak clearly to human reason. As the First Vatican 
Council noted, the "Church herself, with her marvellous propagation, 
eminent holiness, and inexhaustible fruitfulness in everything good, her 
catholic unity and invincible stability, is a great and perpetual motive of 
credibility and an irrefutable witness of her divine mission."258 

I. THE CHURCH IS ONE 

"The sacred mystery of the Church's unity" (UR 2) 

813 The Church is one because of her source: "the highest exemplar 
and source of this mystery is the unity, in the Trinity of Persons, of one 
God, the Father and the Son in the Holy Spirit."259 The Church is 
one because of her founder: for "the Word made flesh, the prince of 
peace, reconciled all men to God by the cross, . . . restoring the unity 
of all in one people and one body."260 The Church is one because of 
her "soul": "It is the Holy Spirit, dwelling in those who believe and 
pervading and ruling over the entire Church, who brings about that 
wonderful communion of the faithful and joins them together so 
intimately in Christ that he is the principle of the Church's unity."261 
Unity is of the essence of the Church: 

What an astonishing mystery! There is one Father of the universe, one 
Logos of the universe, and also one Holy Spirit, everywhere one and 
the same; there is also one virgin become mother, and I should like to 
call her "Church."262 

814 From the beginning, this one Church has been marked by a great 
diversity which comes from both the variety of God's gifts and the 
diversity of those who receive them. Within the unity of the People of 
God, a multiplicity of peoples and cultures is gathered together. 
Among the Church's members, there are different gifts, offices, 
conditions, and ways of life. "Holding a rightful place in the 
communion of the Church there are also particular Churches that 
retain their own traditions."263 The great richness of such diversity is 
not opposed to the Church's unity. Yet sin and the burden of its 



consequences constantly threaten the gift of unity. and so the Apostle 
has to exhort Christians to "maintain the unity of the Spirit in the 
bond of peace."264 

815 What are these bonds of unity? Above all, charity "binds everything 
together in perfect harmony."265 But the unity of the pilgrim Church 
is also assured by visible bonds of communion:  

- profession of one faith received from the Apostles;  

-common celebration of divine worship, especially of the sacraments;  

- apostolic succession through the sacrament of Holy Orders, 
maintaining the fraternal concord of God's family.266 

816 "The sole Church of Christ [is that] which our Savior, after his 
Resurrection, entrusted to Peter's pastoral care, commissioning him 
and the other apostles to extend and rule it.... This Church, 
constituted and organized as a society in the present world, subsists in 
(subsistit in) in) the Catholic Church, which is governed by the 
successor of Peter and by the bishops in communion with him."267 

The Second Vatican Council's Decree on Ecumenism explains: "For it 
is through Christ's Catholic Church alone, which is the universal help 
toward salvation, that the fullness of the means of salvation can be 
obtained. It was to the apostolic college alone, of which Peter is the 
head, that we believe that our Lord entrusted all the blessings of the 
New Covenant, in order to establish on earth the one Body of Christ 
into which all those should be fully incorporated who belong in any 
way to the People of God."268 

Wounds to unity 

817 In fact, "in this one and only Church of God from its very 
beginnings there arose certain rifts, which the Apostle strongly 
censures as damnable. But in subsequent centuries much more serious 
dissensions appeared and large communities became separated from 
full communion with the Catholic Church - for which, often enough, 
men of both sides were to blame."269 The ruptures that wound the 
unity of Christ's Body - here we must distinguish heresy, apostasy, and 
schism270 - do not occur without human sin: 



Where there are sins, there are also divisions, schisms, heresies, and 
disputes. Where there is virtue, however, there also are harmony and 
unity, from which arise the one heart and one soul of all believers.271 

818 "However, one cannot charge with the sin of the separation those 
who at present are born into these communities [that resulted from 
such separation] and in them are brought up in the faith of Christ, and 
the Catholic Church accepts them with respect and affection as 
brothers .... All who have been justified by faith in Baptism are 
incorporated into Christ; they therefore have a right to be called 
Christians, and with good reason are accepted as brothers in the Lord 
by the children of the Catholic Church."272 

819 "Furthermore, many elements of sanctification and of truth"273 
are found outside the visible confines of the Catholic Church: "the 
written Word of God; the life of grace; faith, hope, and charity, with the 
other interior gifts of the Holy Spirit, as well as visible elements."274 
Christ's Spirit uses these Churches and ecclesial communities as 
means of salvation, whose power derives from the fullness of grace and 
truth that Christ has entrusted to the Catholic Church. All these 
blessings come from Christ and lead to him,275 and are in themselves 
calls to "Catholic unity."276 

Toward unity 

820 "Christ bestowed unity on his Church from the beginning. This 
unity, we believe, subsists in the Catholic Church as something she can 
never lose, and we hope that it will continue to increase until the end 
of time."277 Christ always gives his Church the gift of unity, but the 
Church must always pray and work to maintain, reinforce, and perfect 
the unity that Christ wills for her. This is why Jesus himself prayed at 
the hour of his Passion, and does not cease praying to his Father, for 
the unity of his disciples: "That they may all be one. As you, Father, are 
in me and I am in you, may they also be one in us, . . . so that the 
world may know that you have sent me."278 The desire to recover the 
unity of all Christians is a gift of Christ and a call of the Holy 
Spirit.279 

821 Certain things are required in order to respond adequately to this 
call:  



- a permanent renewal of the Church in greater fidelity to her vocation; 
such renewal is the driving-force of the movement toward unity;280  

- conversion of heart as the faithful "try to live holier lives according to 
the Gospel";281 for it is the unfaithfulness of the members to Christ's 
gift which causes divisions;  

- prayer in common, because "change of heart and holiness of life, 
along with public and private prayer for the unity of Christians, should 
be regarded as the soul of the whole ecumenical movement, and merits 
the name 'spiritual ecumenism;"'282  

-fraternal knowledge of each other;283  

- ecumenical formation of the faithful and especially of priests;284  

- dialogue among theologians and meetings among Christians of the 
different churches and communities;285  

- collaboration among Christians in various areas of service to 
mankind.286 "Human service" is the idiomatic phrase. 

822 Concern for achieving unity "involves the whole Church, faithful 
and clergy alike."287 But we must realize "that this holy objective - the 
reconciliation of all Christians in the unity of the one and only Church 
of Christ - transcends human powers and gifts." That is why we place 
all our hope "in the prayer of Christ for the Church, in the love of the 
Father for us, and in the power of the Holy Spirit."288 

II THE CHURCH IS HOLY 

823 "The Church . . . is held, as a matter of faith, to be unfailingly 
holy. This is because Christ, the Son of God, who with the Father and 
the Spirit is hailed as 'alone holy,' loved the Church as his Bride, giving 
himself up for her so as to sanctify her; he joined her to himself as his 
body and endowed her with the gift of the Holy Spirit for the glory of 
God."289 The Church, then, is "the holy People of God,"290 and her 
members are called "saints."291 

824 United with Christ, the Church is sanctified by him; through him 
and with him she becomes sanctifying. "All the activities of the Church 
are directed, as toward their end, to the sanctification of men in Christ 
and the glorification of God."292 It is in the Church that "the fullness 



of the means of salvation"293 has been deposited. It is in her that "by 
the grace of God we acquire holiness."294 

825 "The Church on earth is endowed already with a sanctity that is 
real though imperfect."295 In her members perfect holiness is 
something yet to be acquired: "Strengthened by so many and such 
great means of salvation, all the faithful, whatever their condition or 
state - though each in his own way - are called by the Lord to that 
perfection of sanctity by which the Father himself is perfect."296 

826 Charity is the soul of the holiness to which all are called: it 
"governs, shapes, and perfects all the means of sanctification."297 

If the Church was a body composed of different members, it couldn't 
lack the noblest of all; it must have a Heart, and a Heart BURNING 
WITH LOVE.  

and I realized that this love alone was the true motive force which 
enabled the other members of the Church to act; if it ceased to 
function, the Apostles would forget to preach the gospel, the Martyrs 
would refuse to shed their blood.  

LOVE, IN FACT, IS THE VOCATION WHICH INCLUDES ALL 
OTHERS; IT'S A UNIVERSE OF ITS OWN, COMPRISING ALL 
TIME AND SPACE - IT'S ETERNAL!298 

827 "Christ, 'holy, innocent, and undefiled,' knew nothing of sin, but 
came only to expiate the sins of the people. the Church, however, 
clasping sinners to her bosom, at once holy and always in need of 
purification, follows constantly the path of penance and renewal."299 
All members of the Church, including her ministers, must 
acknowledge that they are sinners.300 In everyone, the weeds of sin 
will still be mixed with the good wheat of the Gospel until the end of 
time.301 Hence the Church gathers sinners already caught up in 
Christ's salvation but still on the way to holiness: 

The Church is therefore holy, though having sinners in her midst, 
because she herself has no other life but the life of grace. If they live 
her life, her members are sanctified; if they move away from her life, 
they fall into sins and disorders that prevent the radiation of her 
sanctity. This is why she suffers and does penance for those offenses, of 



which she has the power to free her children through the blood of 
Christ and the gift of the Holy Spirit.302 

828 By canonizing some of the faithful, i.e., by solemnly pro claiming 
that they practiced heroic virtue and lived in fidelity to God's grace, the 
Church recognizes the power of the Spirit of holiness within her and 
sustains the hope of believers by proposing the saints to them as 
models and intercessors.303 "The saints have always been the source 
and origin of renewal in the most difficult moments in the Church's 
history."304 Indeed, "holiness is the hidden source and infallible 
measure of her apostolic activity and missionary zeal."305 

829 "But while in the most Blessed Virgin the Church has already 
reached that perfection whereby she exists without spot or wrinkle, the 
faithful still strive to conquer sin and increase in holiness. and so they 
turn their eyes to Mary":306 in her, the Church is already the "all-
holy." 

III. THE CHURCH IS CATHOLIC 

What does "catholic" mean? 

830 The word "catholic" means "universal," in the sense of "according 
to the totality" or "in keeping with the whole." the Church is catholic in 
a double sense: First, the Church is catholic because Christ is present 
in her. "Where there is Christ Jesus, there is the Catholic Church."307 
In her subsists the fullness of Christ's body united with its head; this 
implies that she receives from him "the fullness of the means of 
salvation"308 which he has willed: correct and complete confession of 
faith, full sacramental life, and ordained ministry in apostolic 
succession. the Church was, in this fundamental sense, catholic on the 
day of Pentecost309 and will always be so until the day of the Parousia. 

831 Secondly, the Church is catholic because she has been sent out by 
Christ on a mission to the whole of the human race:310 

All men are called to belong to the new People of God. This People, 
therefore, while remaining one and only one, is to be spread 
throughout the whole world and to all ages in order that the design of 
God's will may be fulfilled: he made human nature one in the 
beginning and has decreed that all his children who were scattered 



should be finally gathered together as one.... the character of 
universality which adorns the People of God is a gift from the Lord 
himself whereby the Catholic Church ceaselessly and efficaciously 
seeks for the return of all humanity and all its goods, under Christ the 
Head in the unity of his Spirit.311 

Each particular Church is "catholic" 

832 "The Church of Christ is really present in all legitimately 
organized local groups of the faithful, which, in so far as they are 
united to their pastors, are also quite appropriately called Churches in 
the New Testament.... In them the faithful are gathered together 
through the preaching of the Gospel of Christ, and the mystery of the 
Lord's Supper is celebrated.... In these communities, though they may 
often be small and poor, or existing in the diaspora, Christ is present, 
through whose power and influence the One, Holy, Catholic, and 
Apostolic Church is constituted."312 

833 The phrase "particular church," which is first of all the diocese (or 
eparchy), refers to a community of the Christian faithful in 
communion of faith and sacraments with their bishop ordained in 
apostolic succession.313 These particular Churches "are constituted 
after the model of the universal Church; it is in these and formed out 
of them that the one and unique Catholic Church exists."314 

834 Particular Churches are fully catholic through their communion 
with one of them, the Church of Rome "which presides in charity."315 
"For with this church, by reason of its pre-eminence, the whole 
Church, that is the faithful everywhere, must necessarily be in 
accord."316 Indeed, "from the incarnate Word's descent to us, all 
Christian churches everywhere have held and hold the great Church 
that is here [at Rome] to be their only basis and foundation since, 
according to the Savior's promise, the gates of hell have never prevailed 
against her."317 

835 "Let us be very careful not to conceive of the universal Church as 
the simple sum, or . . . the more or less anomalous federation of 
essentially different particular churches. In the mind of the Lord the 
Church is universal by vocation and mission, but when she pub down 
her roots in a variety of cultural, social, and human terrains, she takes 



on different external expressions and appearances in each part of the 
world."318 The rich variety of ecclesiastical disciplines, liturgical rites, 
and theological and spiritual heritages proper to the local churches 
"unified in a common effort, shows all the more resplendently the 
catholicity of the undivided Church."319 

Who belongs to the Catholic Church? 

836 "All men are called to this catholic unity of the People of God.... 
and to it, in different ways, belong or are ordered: the Catholic faithful, 
others who believe in Christ, and finally all mankind, called by God's 
grace to salvation."320 

837 "Fully incorporated into the society of the Church are those who, 
possessing the Spirit of Christ, accept all the means of salvation given 
to the Church together with her entire organization, and who - by the 
bonds constituted by the profession of faith, the sacraments, 
ecclesiastical government, and communion - are joined in the visible 
structure of the Church of Christ, who rules her through the Supreme 
Pontiff and the bishops. Even though incorporated into the Church, 
one who does not however persevere in charity is not saved. He 
remains indeed in the bosom of the Church, but 'in body' not 'in 
heart.'"321 

838 "The Church knows that she is joined in many ways to the 
baptized who are honored by the name of Christian, but do not profess 
the Catholic faith in its entirety or have not preserved unity or 
communion under the successor of Peter."322 Those "who believe in 
Christ and have been properly baptized are put in a certain, although 
imperfect, communion with the Catholic Church."323 With the 
Orthodox Churches, this communion is so profound "that it lacks little 
to attain the fullness that would permit a common celebration of the 
Lord's Eucharist."324 

The Church and non-Christians 

839 "Those who have not yet received the Gospel are related to the 
People of God in various ways."325  

The relationship of the Church with the Jewish People. When she 
delves into her own mystery, the Church, the People of God in the 



New Covenant, discovers her link with the Jewish People,326 "the first 
to hear the Word of God."327 The Jewish faith, unlike other non-
Christian religions, is already a response to God's revelation in the Old 
Covenant. To the Jews "belong the sonship, the glory, the covenants, 
the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises; to them belong 
the patriarchs, and of their race, according to the flesh, is the 
Christ",328 "for the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable."329 

840 and when one considers the future, God's People of the Old 
Covenant and the new People of God tend towards similar goals: 
expectation of the coming (or the return) of the Messiah. But one 
awaits the return of the Messiah who died and rose from the dead and 
is recognized as Lord and Son of God; the other awaits the coming of a 
Messiah, whose features remain hidden till the end of time; and the 
latter waiting is accompanied by the drama of not knowing or of 
misunderstanding Christ Jesus. 

841 The Church's relationship with the Muslims. "The plan of 
salvation also includes those who acknowledge the Creator, in the first 
place amongst whom are the Muslims; these profess to hold the faith 
of Abraham, and together with us they adore the one, merciful God, 
mankind's judge on the last day."330 

842 The Church's bond with non-Christian religions is in the first 
place the common origin and end of the human race: 

All nations form but one community. This is so because all stem from 
the one stock which God created to people the entire earth, and also 
because all share a common destiny, namely God. His providence, 
evident goodness, and saving designs extend to all against the day 
when the elect are gathered together in the holy city. . .331 

843 The Catholic Church recognizes in other religions that search, 
among shadows and images, for the God who is unknown yet near 
since he gives life and breath and all things and wants all men to be 
saved. Thus, the Church considers all goodness and truth found in 
these religions as "a preparation for the Gospel and given by him who 
enlightens all men that they may at length have life."332 

844 In their religious behavior, however, men also display the limits 
and errors that disfigure the image of God in them: 



Very often, deceived by the Evil One, men have become vain in their 
reasonings, and have exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and served 
the creature rather than the Creator. Or else, living and dying in this 
world without God, they are exposed to ultimate despair.333 

845 To reunite all his children, scattered and led astray by sin, the 
Father willed to call the whole of humanity together into his Son's 
Church. the Church is the place where humanity must rediscover its 
unity and salvation. the Church is "the world reconciled." She is that 
bark which "in the full sail of the Lord's cross, by the breath of the 
Holy Spirit, navigates safely in this world." According to another image 
dear to the Church Fathers, she is prefigured by Noah's ark, which 
alone saves from the flood.334 

"Outside the Church there is no salvation" 

846 How are we to understand this affirmation, often repeated by the 
Church Fathers?335 Re-formulated positively, it means that all 
salvation comes from Christ the Head through the Church which is his 
Body: 

Basing itself on Scripture and Tradition, the Council teaches that the 
Church, a pilgrim now on earth, is necessary for salvation: the one 
Christ is the mediator and the way of salvation; he is present to us in 
his body which is the Church. He himself explicitly asserted the 
necessity of faith and Baptism, and thereby affirmed at the same time 
the necessity of the Church which men enter through Baptism as 
through a door. Hence they could not be saved who, knowing that the 
Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ, 
would refuse either to enter it or to remain in it.336 

847 This affirmation is not aimed at those who, through no fault of 
their own, do not know Christ and his Church: 

Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of 
Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere 
heart, and, moved by grace, try in their actions to do his will as they 
know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may 
achieve eternal salvation.337 



848 "Although in ways known to himself God can lead those who, 
through no fault of their own, are ignorant of the Gospel, to that faith 
without which it is impossible to please him, the Church still has the 
obligation and also the sacred right to evangelize all men."338 

Mission - a requirement of the Church's catholicity 

849 The missionary mandate. "Having been divinely sent to the 
nations that she might be 'the universal sacrament of salvation,' the 
Church, in obedience to the command of her founder and because it is 
demanded by her own essential universality, strives to preach the 
Gospel to all men":339 "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, 
baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the 
Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; 
and Lo, I am with you always, until the close of the age."340 

850 The origin and purpose of mission. the Lord's missionary mandate 
is ultimately grounded in the eternal love of the Most Holy Trinity: 
"The Church on earth is by her nature missionary since, according to 
the plan of the Father, she has as her origin the mission of the Son and 
the Holy Spirit."341 The ultimate purpose of mission is none other 
than to make men share in the communion between the Father and the 
Son in their Spirit of love.342 

851 Missionary motivation. It is from God's love for all men that the 
Church in every age receives both the obligation and the vigor of her 
missionary dynamism, "for the love of Christ urges us on."343 Indeed, 
God "desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the 
truth";344 that is, God wills the salvation of everyone through the 
knowledge of the truth. Salvation is found in the truth. Those who 
obey the prompting of the Spirit of truth are already on the way of 
salvation. But the Church, to whom this truth has been entrusted, 
must go out to meet their desire, so as to bring them the truth. 
Because she believes in God's universal plan of salvation, the Church 
must be missionary. 

852 Missionary paths. the Holy Spirit is the protagonist, "the principal 
agent of the whole of the Church's mission."345 It is he who leads the 
Church on her missionary paths. "This mission continues and, in the 
course of history, unfolds the mission of Christ, who was sent to 



evangelize the poor; so the Church, urged on by the Spirit of Christ, 
must walk the road Christ himself walked, a way of poverty and 
obedience, of service and self-sacrifice even to death, a death from 
which he emerged victorious by his resurrection."346 So it is that "the 
blood of martyrs is the seed of Christians."347 

853 On her pilgrimage, the Church has also experienced the 
"discrepancy existing between the message she proclaims and the 
human weakness of those to whom the Gospel has been 
entrusted."348 Only by taking the "way of penance and renewal," the 
"narrow way of the cross," can the People of God extend Christ's 
reign.349 For "just as Christ carried out the work of redemption in 
poverty and oppression, so the Church is called to follow the same 
path if she is to communicate the fruits of salvation to men."350 

854 By her very mission, "the Church . . . travels the same journey as 
all humanity and shares the same earthly lot with the world: she is to 
be a leaven and, as it were, the soul of human society in its renewal by 
Christ and transformation into the family of God."351 Missionary 
endeavor requires patience. It begins with the proclamation of the 
Gospel to peoples and groups who do not yet believe in Christ,352 
continues with the establishment of Christian communities that are "a 
sign of God's presence in the world,"353 and leads to the foundation of 
local churches.354 It must involve a process of inculturation if the 
Gospel is to take flesh in each people's culture.355 There will be times 
of defeat. "With regard to individuals, groups, and peoples it is only by 
degrees that [the Church] touches and penetrates them and so receives 
them into a fullness which is Catholic."356 

855 The Church's mission stimulates efforts towards Christian 
unity.357 Indeed, "divisions among Christians prevent the Church 
from realizing in practice the fullness of catholicity proper to her in 
those of her sons who, though joined to her by Baptism, are yet 
separated from full communion with her. Furthermore, the Church 
herself finds it more difficult to express in actual life her full catholicity 
in all its aspects."358 

856 The missionary task implies a respectful dialogue with those who 
do not yet accept the Gospel.359 Believers can profit from this 
dialogue by learning to appreciate better "those elements of truth and 



grace which are found among peoples, and which are, as it were, a 
secret presence of God."360 They proclaim the Good News to those 
who do not know it, in order to consolidate, complete, and raise up the 
truth and the goodness that God has distributed among men and 
nations, and to purify them from error and evil "for the glory of God, 
the confusion of the demon, and the happiness of man."361 

IV. THE CHURCH IS APOSTOLIC 

857 The Church is apostolic because she is founded on the apostles, in 
three ways:  

- she was and remains built on "the foundation of the Apostles,"362 
The witnesses chosen and sent on mission by Christ himself;363  

- with the help of the Spirit dwelling in her, the Church keeps and 
hands on the teaching,364 The "good deposit," the salutary words she 
has heard from the apostles;365  

- she continues to be taught, sanctified, and guided by the apostles 
until Christ's return, through their successors in pastoral office: the 
college of bishops, "assisted by priests, in union with the successor of 
Peter, the Church's supreme pastor":366 

You are the eternal Shepherd 

who never leaves his flock untended. 

Through the apostles you watch over us and protect us always. 

You made them shepherds of the flock 

to share in the work of your Son....367 

The Apostles' mission 

858 Jesus is the Father's Emissary. From the beginning of his ministry, 
he "called to him those whom he desired; .... and he appointed twelve, 
whom also he named apostles, to be with him, and to be sent out to 
preach."368 From then on, they would also be his "emissaries" (Greek 
apostoloi). In them, Christ continues his own mission: "As the Father 
has sent me, even so I send you."369 The apostles' ministry is the 
continuation of his mission; Jesus said to the Twelve: "he who receives 
you receives me."370 



859 Jesus unites them to the mission he received from the Father. As 
"the Son can do nothing of his own accord," but receives everything 
from the Father who sent him, so those whom Jesus sends can do 
nothing apart from him,371 from whom they received both the 
mandate for their mission and the power to carry it out. Christ's 
apostles knew that they were called by God as "ministers of a new 
covenant," "servants of God," "ambassadors for Christ," "servants of 
Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God."372 

860 In the office of the apostles there is one aspect that cannot be 
transmitted: to be the chosen witnesses of the Lord's Resurrection and 
so the foundation stones of the Church. But their office also has a 
permanent aspect. Christ promised to remain with them always. the 
divine mission entrusted by Jesus to them "will continue to the end of 
time, since the Gospel they handed on is the lasting source of all life 
for the Church. Therefore, . . . the apostles took care to appoint 
successors."373 

The bishops - successors of the apostles 

861 "In order that the mission entrusted to them might be continued 
after their death, [the apostles] consigned, by will and testament, as it 
were, to their immediate collaborators the duty of completing and 
consolidating the work they had begun, urging them to tend to the 
whole flock, in which the Holy Spirit had appointed them to shepherd 
the Church of God. They accordingly designated such men and then 
made the ruling that likewise on their death other proven men should 
take over their ministry."374 

862 "Just as the office which the Lord confided to Peter alone, as first 
of the apostles, destined to be transmitted to his successors, is a 
permanent one, so also endures the office, which the apostles received, 
of shepherding the Church, a charge destined to be exercised without 
interruption by the sacred order of bishops."375 Hence the Church 
teaches that "the bishops have by divine institution taken the place of 
the apostles as pastors of the Church, in such wise that whoever listens 
to them is listening to Christ and whoever despises them despises 
Christ and him who sent Christ."376 

The apostolate 



863 The whole Church is apostolic, in that she remains, through the 
successors of St. Peter and the other apostles, in communion of faith 
and life with her origin: and in that she is "sent out" into the whole 
world. All members of the Church share in this mission, though in 
various ways. "The Christian vocation is, of its nature, a vocation to the 
apostolate as well." Indeed, we call an apostolate "every activity of the 
Mystical Body" that aims "to spread the Kingdom of Christ over all the 
earth."377 

864 "Christ, sent by the Father, is the source of the Church's whole 
apostolate"; thus the fruitfulness of apostolate for ordained ministers as 
well as for lay people clearly depends on their vital union with 
Christ.378 In keeping with their vocations, the demands of the times 
and the various gifts of the Holy Spirit, the apostolate assumes the 
most varied forms. But charity, drawn from the Eucharist above all, is 
always "as it were, the soul of the whole apostolate."379 

865 The Church is ultimately one, holy, catholic, and apostolic in her 
deepest and ultimate identity, because it is in her that "the Kingdom of 
heaven," the "Reign of God,"380 already exists and will be fulfilled at 
the end of time. the kingdom has come in the person of Christ and 
grows mysteriously in the hearts of those incorporated into him, until 
its full eschatological manifestation. Then all those he has redeemed 
and made "holy and blameless before him in love,"381 will be gathered 
together as the one People of God, the  

"Bride of the Lamb,"382 "the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of 
heaven from God, having the glory of God."383 For "the wall of the 
city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the 
twelve apostles of the Lamb."384 

IN BRIEF 

866 The Church is one: she acknowledges one Lord, confesses one 
faith, is born of one Baptism, forms only one Body, is given life by the 
one Spirit, for the sake of one hope (cf Eph 4:3-5), at whose fulfillment 
all divisions will be overcome. 

867 The Church is holy: the Most Holy God is her author; Christ, her 
bridegroom, gave himself up to make her holy; the Spirit of holiness 
gives her life. Since she still includes sinners, she is "the sinless one 



made up of sinners." Her holiness shines in the saints; in Mary she is 
already all-holy. 

868 The Church is catholic: she proclaims the fullness of the faith. She 
bears in herself and administers the totality of the means of salvation. 
She is sent out to all peoples. She speaks to all men. She encompasses 
all times. She is "missionary of her very nature" (AG 2). 

869 The Church is apostolic. She is built on a lasting foundation: "the 
twelve apostles of the Lamb" (Rev 21:14). She is indestructible (cf Mt 
16:18). She is upheld infallibly in the truth: Christ governs her through 
Peter and the other apostles, who are present in their successors, the 
Pope and the college of bishops. 

870 "The sole Church of Christ which in the Creed we profess to be 
one, holy, catholic, and apostolic, . . . subsists in the Catholic Church, 
which is governed by the successor of Peter and by the bishops in 
communion with him. Nevertheless, many elements of sanctification 
and of truth are found outside its visible confines"(LG 8).

CHAPTER THREE I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT 

 

 

 

Article 9 "I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH" 

 

 

Paragraph 4. CHRIST'S FAITHFUL - HIERARCHY, LAITY, 
CONSECRATED LIFE 

871 "The Christian faithful are those who, inasmuch as they have been 
incorporated in Christ through Baptism, have been constituted as the 
people of God; for this reason, since they have become sharers in 
Christ's priestly, prophetic, and royal office in their own manner, they 
are called to exercise the mission which God has entrusted to the 
Church to fulfill in the world, in accord with the condition proper to 
each one."385 

872 "In virtue of their rebirth in Christ there exists among all the 
Christian faithful a true equality with regard to dignity and the activity 
whereby all cooperate in the building up of the Body of Christ in 
accord with each one's own condition and function."386 



873 The very differences which the Lord has willed to put between the 
members of his body serve its unity and mission. For "in the Church 
there is diversity of ministry but unity of mission. To the apostles and 
their successors Christ has entrusted the office of teaching, sanctifying 
and governing in his name and by his power. But the laity are made to 
share in the priestly, prophetical, and kingly office of Christ; they have 
therefore, in the Church and in the world, their own assignment in the 
mission of the whole People of God."387 Finally, "from both groups 
[hierarchy and laity] there exist Christian faithful who are consecrated 
to God in their own special manner and serve the salvific mission of 
the Church through the profession of the evangelical counsels."388 

I. THE HIERARCHICAL CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH 

Why the ecclesial ministry? 

874 Christ is himself the source of ministry in the Church. He 
instituted the Church. He gave her authority and mission, orientation 
and goal: 

In order to shepherd the People of God and to increase its numbers 
without cease, Christ the Lord set up in his Church a variety of offices 
which aim at the good of the whole body. the holders of office, who are 
invested with a sacred power, are, in fact, dedicated to promoting the 
interests of their brethren, so that all who belong to the People of God 
. . . may attain to salvation.389 

875 "How are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? 
And how are they to hear without a preacher? And how can men 
preach unless they are sent?"390 No one - no individual and no 
community - can proclaim the Gospel to himself: "Faith comes from 
what is heard."391 No one can give himself the mandate and the 
mission to proclaim the Gospel. The one sent by the Lord does not 
speak and act on his own authority, but by virtue of Christ's authority; 
not as a member of the community, but speaking to it in the name of 
Christ. No one can bestow grace on himself; it must be given and 
offered. This fact presupposes ministers of grace, authorized and 
empowered by Christ. From him, bishops and priests receive the 
mission and faculty ("the sacred power") to act in persona Christi 
Capitis; deacons receive the strength to serve the people of God in the 



diaconia of liturgy, word and charity, in communion with the bishop 
and his presbyterate. The ministry in which Christ's emissaries do and 
give by God's grace what they cannot do and give by their own powers, 
is called a "sacrament" by the Church's tradition. Indeed, the ministry 
of the Church is conferred by a special sacrament. 

876 Intrinsically linked to the sacramental nature of ecclesial ministry 
is its character as service. Entirely dependent on Christ who gives 
mission and authority, ministers are truly "slaves of Christ,"392 in the 
image of him who freely took "the form of a slave" for us.393 Because 
the word and grace of which they are ministers are not their own, but 
are given to them by Christ for the sake of others, they must freely 
become the slaves of all.394 

877 Likewise, it belongs to the sacramental nature of ecclesial ministry 
that it have a collegial character. In fact, from the beginning of his 
ministry, the Lord Jesus instituted the Twelve as "the seeds of the new 
Israel and the beginning of the sacred hierarchy."395 Chosen together, 
they were also sent out together, and their fraternal unity would be at 
the service of the fraternal communion of all the faithful: they would 
reflect and witness to the communion of the divine persons.396 For 
this reason every bishop exercises his ministry from within the 
episcopal college, in communion with the bishop of Rome, the 
successor of St. Peter and head of the college. So also priests exercise 
their ministry from within the presbyterium of the diocese, under the 
direction of their bishop. 

878 Finally, it belongs to the sacramental nature of ecclesial ministry 
that it have a personal character. Although Chnst's ministers act in 
communion with one another, they also always act in a personal way. 
Each one is called personally: "You, follow me"397 in order to be a 
personal witness within the common mission, to bear personal 
responsibility before him who gives the mission, acting "in his person" 
and for other persons: "I baptize you in the name of the Father and of 
the Son and of the Holy Spirit ..."; "I absolve you...." 

879 Sacramental ministry in the Church, then, is a service exercised in 
the name of Christ. It has a personal character and a collegial form. 
This is evidenced by the bonds between the episcopal college and its 
head, the successor of St. Peter, and in the relationship between the 



bishop's pastoral responsibility for his particular church and the 
common solicitude of the episcopal college for the universal Church. 

The episcopal college and its head, the Pope 

880 When Christ instituted the Twelve, "he constituted [them] in the 
form of a college or permanent assembly, at the head of which he 
placed Peter, chosen from among them."398 Just as "by the Lord's 
institution, St. Peter and the rest of the apostles constitute a single 
apostolic college, so in like fashion the Roman Pontiff, Peter's 
successor, and the bishops, the successors of the apostles, are related 
with and united to one another."399 

881 The Lord made Simon alone, whom he named Peter, the "rock" of 
his Church. He gave him the keys of his Church and instituted him 
shepherd of the whole flock.400 "The office of binding and loosing 
which was given to Peter was also assigned to the college of apostles 
united to its head."401 This pastoral office of Peter and the other 
apostles belongs to the Church's very foundation and is continued by 
the bishops under the primacy of the Pope. 

882 The Pope, Bishop of Rome and Peter's successor, "is the perpetual 
and visible source and foundation of the unity both of the bishops and 
of the whole company of the faithful."402 "For the Roman Pontiff, by 
reason of his office as Vicar of Christ, and as pastor of the entire 
Church has full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church, 
a power which he can always exercise unhindered."403 

883 "The college or body of bishops has no authority unless united 
with the Roman Pontiff, Peter's successor, as its head." As such, this 
college has "supreme and full authority over the universal Church; but 
this power cannot be exercised without the agreement of the Roman 
Pontiff."404 

884 "The college of bishops exercises power over the universal Church 
in a solemn manner in an ecumenical council."405 But "there never is 
an ecumenical council which is not confirmed or at least recognized as 
such by Peter's successor."406 

885 "This college, in so far as it is composed of many members, is the 
expression of the variety and universality of the People of God; and of 



the unity of the flock of Christ, in so far as it is assembled under one 
head."407 

886 "The individual bishops are the visible source and foundation of 
unity in their own particular Churches."408 As such, they "exercise 
their pastoral office over the portion of the People of God assigned to 
them,"409 assisted by priests and deacons. But, as a member of the 
episcopal college, each bishop shares in the concern for all the 
Churches.410 The bishops exercise this care first "by ruling well their 
own Churches as portions of the universal Church," and so 
contributing "to the welfare of the whole Mystical Body, which, from 
another point of view, is a corporate body of Churches."411 They 
extend it especially to the poor,412 to those persecuted for the faith, as 
well as to missionaries who are working throughout the world. 

887 Neighboring particular Churches who share the same culture form 
ecclesiastical provinces or larger groupings called patriarchates or 
regions.413 The bishops of these groupings can meet in synods or 
provincial councils. "In a like fashion, the episcopal conferences at the 
present time are in a position to contribute in many and fruitful ways 
to the concrete realization of the collegiate spirit."414 

The teaching office 

888 Bishops, with priests as co-workers, have as their first task "to 
preach the Gospel of God to all men," in keeping with the Lord's 
command.415 They are "heralds of faith, who draw new disciples to 
Christ; they are authentic teachers" of the apostolic faith "endowed 
with the authority of Christ."416 

889 In order to preserve the Church in the purity of the faith handed 
on by the apostles, Christ who is the Truth willed to confer on her a 
share in his own infallibility. By a "supernatural sense of faith" the 
People of God, under the guidance of the Church's living Magisterium, 
"unfailingly adheres to this faith."417 

890 The mission of the Magisterium is linked to the definitive nature 
of the covenant established by God with his people in Christ. It is this 
Magisterium's task to preserve God's people from deviations and 
defections and to guarantee them the objective possibility of professing 
the true faith without error. Thus, the pastoral duty of the Magisterium 



is aimed at seeing to it that the People of God abides in the truth that 
liberates. To fulfill this service, Christ endowed the Church's shepherds 
with the charism of infallibility in matters of faith and morals. the 
exercise of this charism takes several forms: 

891 "The Roman Pontiff, head of the college of bishops, enjoys this 
infallibility in virtue of his office, when, as supreme pastor and teacher 
of all the faithful - who confirms his brethren in the faith he proclaims 
by a definitive act a doctrine pertaining to faith or morals.... the 
infallibility promised to the Church is also present in the body of 
bishops when, together with Peter's successor, they exercise the 
supreme Magisterium," above all in an Ecumenical Council.418 When 
the Church through its supreme Magisterium proposes a doctrine "for 
belief as being divinely revealed,"419 and as the teaching of Christ, the 
definitions "must be adhered to with the obedience of faith."420 This 
infallibility extends as far as the deposit of divine Revelation itself.421 

892 Divine assistance is also given to the successors of the apostles, 
teaching in communion with the successor of Peter, and, in a 
particular way, to the bishop of Rome, pastor of the whole Church, 
when, without arriving at an infallible definition and without 
pronouncing in a "definitive manner," they propose in the exercise of 
the ordinary Magisterium a teaching that leads to better understanding 
of Revelation in matters of faith and morals. To this ordinary teaching 
the faithful "are to adhere to it with religious assent"422 which, though 
distinct from the assent of faith, is nonetheless an extension of it. 

The sanctifying office 

893 The bishop is "the steward of the grace of the supreme 
priesthood,"423 especially in the Eucharist which he offers personally 
or whose offering he assures through the priests, his co-workers. the 
Eucharist is the center of the life of the particular Church. the bishop 
and priests sanctify the Church by their prayer and work, by their 
ministry of the word and of the sacraments. They sanctify her by their 
example, "not as domineering over those in your charge but being 
examples to the flock."424 Thus, "together with the flock entrusted to 
them, they may attain to eternal life."425 

The governing office 



894 "The bishops, as vicars and legates of Christ, govern the particular 
Churches assigned to them by their counsels, exhortations, and 
example, but over and above that also by the authority and sacred 
power" which indeed they ought to exercise so as to edify, in the spirit 
of service which is that of their Master.426 

895 "The power which they exercise personally in the name of Christ, 
is proper, ordinary, and immediate, although its exercise is ultimately 
controlled by the supreme authority of the Church."427 But the 
bishops should not be thought of as vicars of the Pope. His ordinary 
and immediate authority over the whole Church does not annul, but 
on the contrary confirms and defends that of the bishops. Their 
authority must be exercised in communion with the whole Church 
under the guidance of the Pope. 

896 The Good Shepherd ought to be the model and "form" of the 
bishop's pastoral office. Conscious of his own weaknesses, "the bishop . 
. . can have compassion for those who are ignorant and erring. He 
should not refuse to listen to his subjects whose welfare he promotes as 
of his very own children.... the faithful ... should be closely attached to 
the bishop as the Church is to Jesus Christ, and as Jesus Christ is to 
the Father":428 

Let all follow the bishop, as Jesus Christ follows his Father, and the 
college of presbyters as the apostles; respect the deacons as you do 
God's law. Let no one do anything concerning the Church in 
separation from the bishop.429 

II. THE LAY FAITHFUL 

897 "The term 'laity' is here understood to mean all the faithful except 
those in Holy Orders and those who belong to a religious state 
approved by the Church. That is, the faithful, who by Baptism are 
incorporated into Christ and integrated into the People of God, are 
made sharers in their particular way in the priestly, prophetic, and 
kingly office of Christ, and have their own part to play in the mission 
of the whole Christian people in the Church and in the World."430 

The vocation of lay people 



898 "By reason of their special vocation it belongs to the laity to seek 
the kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and directing 
them according to God's will.... It pertains to them in a special way so 
to illuminate and order all temporal things with which they are closely 
associated that these may always be effected and grow according to 
Christ and maybe to the glory of the Creator and Redeemer."431 

899 The initiative of lay Christians is necessary especially when the 
matter involves discovering or inventing the means for permeating 
social, political, and economic realities with the demands of Christian 
doctrine and life. This initiative is a normal element of the life of the 
Church: 

Lay believers are in the front line of Church life; for them the Church 
is the animating principle of human society. Therefore, they in 
particular ought to have an ever-clearer consciousness not only of 
belonging to the Church, but of being the Church, that is to say, the 
community of the faithful on earth under the leadership of the Pope, 
the common Head, and of the bishops in communion with him. They 
are the Church.432 

900 Since, like all the faithful, lay Christians are entrusted by God with 
the apostolate by virtue of their Baptism and Confirmation, they have 
the right and duty, individually or grouped in associations, to work so 
that the divine message of salvation may be known and accepted by all 
men throughout the earth. This duty is the more pressing when it is 
only through them that men can hear the Gospel and know Christ. 
Their activity in ecclesial communities is so necessary that, for the 
most part, the apostolate of the pastors cannot be fully effective 
without it.433  

The participation of lay people in Christ's priestly office 

901 "Hence the laity, dedicated as they are to Christ and anointed by 
the Holy Spirit, are marvellously called and prepared so that even 
richer fruits of the Spirit maybe produced in them. For all their works, 
prayers, and apostolic undertakings, family and married life, daily 
work, relaxation of mind and body, if they are accomplished in the 
Spirit - indeed even the hardships of life if patiently born - all these 
become spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. In 



the celebration of the Eucharist these may most fittingly be offered to 
the Father along with the body of the Lord. and so, worshipping 
everywhere by their holy actions, the laity consecrate the world itself to 
God, everywhere offering worship by the holiness of their lives."434 

902 In a very special way, parents share in the office of sanctifying "by 
leading a conjugal life in the Christian spirit and by seeing to the 
Christian education of their children."435 

903 Lay people who possess the required qualities can be admitted 
permanently to the ministries of lector and acolyte.436 When the 
necessity of the Church warrants it and when ministers are lacking, lay 
persons, even if they are not lectors or acolytes, can also supply for 
certain of their offices, namely, to exercise the ministry of the word, to 
preside over liturgical prayers, to confer Baptism, and to distribute 
Holy Communion in accord with the prescriptions of law."437 

Participation in Christ's prophetic office 

904 "Christ . . . fulfills this prophetic office, not only by the hierarchy . 
. . but also by the laity. He accordingly both establishes them as 
witnesses and provides them with the sense of the faith [sensus fidei] 
and the grace of the word"438 

To teach in order to lead others to faith is the task of every preacher 
and of each believer.439 

905 Lay people also fulfill their prophetic mission by evangelization, 
"that is, the proclamation of Christ by word and the testimony of life." 
For lay people, "this evangelization . . . acquires a specific property and 
peculiar efficacy because it is accomplished in the ordinary 
circumstances of the world."440 

This witness of life, however, is not the sole element in the apostolate; 
the true apostle is on the lookout for occasions of announcing Christ 
by word, either to unbelievers . . . or to the faithful.441 

906 Lay people who are capable and trained may also collaborate in 
catechetical formation, in teaching the sacred sciences, and in use of 
the communications media.442 



907 "In accord with the knowledge, competence, and preeminence 
which they possess, [lay people] have the right and even at times a duty 
to manifest to the sacred pastors their opinion on matters which 
pertain to the good of the Church, and they have a right to make their 
opinion known to the other Christian faithful, with due regard to the 
integrity of faith and morals and reverence toward their pastors, and 
with consideration for the common good and the dignity of 
persons."443 

Participation in Christ's kingly office 

908 By his obedience unto death,444 Christ communicated to his 
disciples the gift of royal freedom, so that they might "by the self-
abnegation of a holy life, overcome the reign of sin in themselves":445 

That man is rightly called a king who makes his own body an obedient 
subject and, by governing himself with suitable rigor, refuses to let his 
passions breed rebellion in his soul, for he exercises a kind of royal 
power over himself. and because he knows how to rule his own person 
as king, so too does he sit as its judge. He will not let himself be 
imprisoned by sin, or thrown headlong into wickedness.446 

909 "Moreover, by uniting their forces let the laity so remedy the 
institutions and conditions of the world when the latter are an 
inducement to sin, that these may be conformed to the norms of 
justice, favoring rather than hindering the practice of virtue. By so 
doing they will impregnate culture and human works with a moral 
value."447 

910 "The laity can also feel called, or be in fact called, to cooperate 
with their pastors in the service of the ecclesial community, for the sake 
of its growth and life. This can be done through the exercise of 
different kinds of ministries according to the grace and charisms which 
the Lord has been pleased to bestow on them."448 

911 In the Church, "lay members of the Christian faithful can 
cooperate in the exercise of this power [of governance] in accord with 
the norm of law."449 And so the Church provides for their presence at 
particular councils, diocesan synods, pastoral councils; the exercise of 
the pastoral care of a parish, collaboration in finance committees, and 
participation in ecclesiastical tribunals, etc.450 



912 The faithful should "distinguish carefully between the rights and 
the duties which they have as belonging to the Church and those which 
fall to them as members of the human society. They will strive to unite 
the two harmoniously, remembering that in every temporal affair they 
are to be guided by a Christian conscience, since no human activity, 
even of the temporal order, can be withdrawn from God's 
dominion."451 

913 "Thus, every person, through these gifts given to him, is at once 
the witness and the living instrument of the mission of the Church 
itself 'according to the measure of Christ's bestowal."'452 

III. THE CONSECRATED LIFE 

914 "The state of life which is constituted by the profession of the 
evangelical counsels, while not entering into the hierarchical structure 
of the Church, belongs undeniably to her life and holiness."453 

Evangelical counsels, consecrated life 

915 Christ proposes the evangelical counsels, in their great variety, to 
every disciple. the perfection of charity, to which all the faithful are 
called, entails for those who freely follow the call to consecrated life the 
obligation of practicing chastity in celibacy for the sake of the 
Kingdom, poverty and obedience. It is the profession of these counsels, 
within a permanent state of life recognized by the Church, that 
characterizes the life consecrated to God.454 

916 The state of consecrated life is thus one way of experiencing a 
"more intimate" consecration, rooted in Baptism and dedicated totally 
to God.455 In the consecrated life, Christ's faithful, moved by the 
Holy Spirit, propose to follow Christ more nearly, to give themselves to 
God who is loved above all and, pursuing the perfection of charity in 
the service of the Kingdom, to signify and proclaim in the Church the 
glory of the world to come.456 

One great tree, with many branches 

917 "From the God-given seed of the counsels a wonderful and wide-
spreading tree has grown up in the field of the Lord, branching out 
into various forms of the religious life lived in solitude or in 
community. Different religious families have come into existence in 



which spiritual resources are multiplied for the progress in holiness of 
their members and for the good of the entire Body of Christ."457 

918 From the very beginning of the Church there were men and 
women who set out to follow Christ with greater liberty, and to imitate 
him more closely, by practicing the evangelical counsels. They led lives 
dedicated to God, each in his own way. Many of them, under the 
inspiration of the Holy Spirit, became hermits or founded religious 
families. These the Church, by virtue of her authority, gladly accepted 
and approved.458 

919 Bishops will always strive to discern new gifts of consecrated life 
granted to the Church by the Holy Spirit; the approval of new forms of 
consecrated life is reserved to the Apostolic See.459 

The eremitic life 

920 Without always professing the three evangelical counsels publicly, 
hermits "devote their life to the praise of God and salvation of the 
world through a stricter separation from the world, the silence of 
solitude and assiduous prayer and penance."460 

921 They manifest to everyone the interior aspect of the mystery of the 
Church, that is, personal intimacy with Christ. Hidden from the eyes 
of men, the life of the hermit is a silent preaching of the Lord, to whom 
he has surrendered his life simply because he is everything to him. 
Here is a particular call to find in the desert, in the thick of spiritual 
battle, the glory of the Crucified One. 

Consecrated virgins 

922 From apostolic times Christian virgins."460B and widows."460T, 
called by the Lord to cling only to him with greater freedom of heart, 
body, and spirit, have decided with the Church's approval to live in a 
state of virginity "for the sake of the Kingdom of heaven."461 

923 "Virgins who, committed to the holy plan of following Christ more 
closely, are consecrated to God by the diocesan bishop according to 
the approved liturgical rite, are betrothed mystically to Christ, the Son 
of God, and are dedicated to the service of the Church."462 By this 
solemn rite (Consecratio virginum), the virgin is "constituted . . . a 
sacred person, a transcendent sign of the Church's love for Christ, and 



an eschatological image of this heavenly Bride of Christ and of the life 
to come."463 

924 "As with other forms of consecrated life," the order of virgins 
establishes the woman living in the world (or the nun) in prayer, 
penance, service of her brethren, and apostolic activity, according to 
the state of life and spiritual gifts given to her.464 Consecrated virgins 
can form themselves into associations to observe their commitment 
more faithfully.465 

Religious life 

925 Religious life was born in the East during the first centuries of 
Christianity. Lived within institutes canonically erected by the Church, 
it is distinguished from other forms of consecrated life by its liturgical 
character, public profession of the evangelical counsels, fraternal life 
led in common, and witness given to the union of Christ with the 
Church.466 

926 Religious life derives from the mystery of the Church. It is a gift 
she has received from her Lord, a gift she offers as a stable way of life 
to the faithful called by God to profess the counsels. Thus, the Church 
can both show forth Christ and acknowledge herself to be the Savior's 
bride. Religious life in its various forms is called to signify the very 
charity of God in the language of our time. 

927 All religious, whether exempt or not, take their place among the 
collaborators of the diocesan bishop in his pastoral duty.467 From the 
outset of the work of evangelization, the missionary "planting" and 
expansion of the Church require the presence of the religious life in all 
its forms.468 "History witnesses to the outstanding service rendered 
by religious families in the propagation of the faith and in the 
formation of new Churches: from the ancient monastic institutions to 
the medieval orders, all the way to the more recent congregations."469 

Secular institutes 

928 "A secular institute is an institute of consecrated life in which the 
Christian faithful living in the world strive for the perfection of charity 
and work for the sanctification of the world especially from within."470 



929 By a "life perfectly and entirely consecrated to [such] 
sanctification," the members of these institutes share in the Church's 
task of evangelization, "in the world and from within the world," where 
their presence acts as "leaven in the world."471 "Their witness of a 
Christian life" aims "to order temporal things according to God and 
inform the world with the power of the gospel." They commit 
themselves to the evangelical counsels by sacred bonds and observe 
among themselves the communion and fellowship appropriate to their 
"particular secular way of life."472 

Societies of apostolic life 

930 Alongside the different forms of consecrated life are "societies of 
apostolic life whose members without religious vows pursue the 
particular apostolic purpose of their society, and lead a life as brothers 
or sisters in common according to a particular manner of life, strive for 
the perfection of charity through the observance of the constitutions. 
Among these there are societies in which the members embrace the 
evangelical counsels" according to their constitutions.473 

Consecration and mission: proclaiming the King who is corning 

931 Already dedicated to him through Baptism, the person who 
surrenders himself to the God he loves above all else thereby 
consecrates himself more intimately to God's service and to the good 
of the Church. By this state of life consecrated to God, the Church 
manifests Christ and shows us how the Holy Spirit acts so wonderfully 
in her. and so the first mission of those who profess the evangelical 
counsels is to live out their consecration. Moreover, "since members of 
institutes of consecrated life dedicate themselves through their 
consecration to the service of the Church they are obliged in a special 
manner to engage in missionary work, in accord with the character of 
the institute."474 

932 In the Church, which is like the sacrament - the sign and 
instrument - of God's own life, the consecrated life is seen as a special 
sign of the mystery of redemption. To follow and imitate Christ more 
nearly and to manifest more clearly his self-emptying is to be more 
deeply present to one's contemporaries, in the heart of Christ. For 
those who are on this "narrower" path encourage their brethren by 



their example, and bear striking witness "that the world cannot be 
transfigured and offered to God without the spirit of the 
beatitudes."475 

933 Whether their witness is public, as in the religious state, or less 
public, or even secret, Christ's coming remains for all those 
consecrated both the origin and rising sun of their life: 

For the People of God has here no lasting city, . . . [and this state] 
reveals more clearly to all believers the heavenly goods which are 
already present in this age, witnessing to the new and eternal life which 
we have acquired through the redemptive work of Christ and preluding 
our future resurrection and the glory of the heavenly kingdom.476 

IN BRIEF 

934 "Among the Christian faithful by divine institution there exist in 
the Church sacred ministers, who are also called clerics in law, and 
other Christian faithful who are also called laity." In both groups there 
are those Christian faithful who, professing the evangelical counsels, 
are consecrated to God and so serve the Church's saving mission (cf. 
CIC, can. 207 # 1, 2). 

935 To proclaim the faith and to plant his reign, Christ sends his 
apostles and their successors. He gives them a share in his own 
mission. From him they receive the power to act in his person. 

936 The Lord made St. Peter the visible foundation of his Church. He 
entrusted the keys of the Church to him. the bishop of the Church of 
Rome, successor to St. Peter, is "head of the college of bishops, the 
Vicar of Christ and Pastor of the universal Church on earth" (CIC, 
can. 331). 

937 The Pope enjoys, by divine institution, "supreme, full, immediate, 
and universal power in the care of souls" (CD 2). 

938 The Bishops, established by the Holy Spirit, succeed the apostles. 
They are "the visible source and foundation of unity in their own 
particular Churches" (LG 23). 

939 Helped by the priests, their co-workers, and by the deacons, the 
bishops have the duty of authentically teaching the faith, celebrating 



divine worship, above all the Eucharist, and guiding their Churches as 
true pastors. Their responsibility also includes concern for all the 
Churches, with and under the Pope. 

940 "The characteristic of the lay state being a life led in the midst of 
the world and of secular affairs, lay people are called by God to make 
of their apostolate, through the vigor of their Christian spirit, a leaven 
in the world" (AA 2 # 2). 

941 Lay people share in Christ's priesthood: ever more united with 
him, they exhibit the grace of Baptism and Confirmation in all 
dimensions of their personal family, social and ecclesial lives, and so 
fulfill the call to holiness addressed to all the baptized. 

942 By virtue of their prophetic mission, lay people "are called . . . to 
be witnesses to Christ in all circumstances and at the very heart of the 
community of mankind" (GS 43 # 4). 

943 By virtue of their kingly mission, lay people have the power to 
uproot the rule of sin within themselves and in the world, by their self-
denial and holiness of life (cf. LG 36). 

944 The life consecrated to God is characterized by the public 
profession of the evangelical counsels of poverty, chastity, and 
obedience, in a stable state of life recognized by the Church. 

945 Already destined for him through Baptism, the person who 
surrenders himself to the God he loves above all else thereby 
consecrates himself more intimately to God's service and to the good 
of the whole Church.

PART ONE: THE PROFESSION OF FAITH 

 

 

 

SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS 

 

 

 

CHAPTER THREE I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT 

 

 

 

Article 9 "I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH" 

 

 

Paragraph 5. THE COMMUNION OF SAINTS 

946 After confessing "the holy catholic Church," the Apostles' Creed 
adds "the communion of saints." In a certain sense this article is a 
further explanation of the preceding: "What is the Church if not the 
assembly of all the saints?"477 The communion of saints is the 
Church. 

947 "Since all the faithful form one body, the good of each is 
communicated to the others.... We must therefore believe that there 
exists a communion of goods in the Church. But the most important 
member is Christ, since he is the head.... Therefore, the riches of 



Christ are communicated to all the members, through the 
sacraments."478 "As this Church is governed by one and the same 
Spirit, all the goods she has received necessarily become a common 
fund."479 

948 The term "communion of saints" therefore has two closely linked 
meanings: communion in holy things (sancta)" and "among holy 
persons (sancti). 

"Sancta sancti's! ("God's holy gifts for God's holy people") is 
proclaimed by the celebrant in most Eastern liturgies during the 
elevation of the holy Gifts before the distribution of communion. the 
faithful (sancta) are fed by Christ's holy body and blood (sancta) to 
grow in the communion of the Holy Spirit (koinonia) and to 
communicate it to the world. 

I. COMMUNION IN SPIRITUAL GOODS 

949 In the primitive community of Jerusalem, the disciples "devoted 
themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of 
the bread and the prayers."480  

Communion in the faith. the faith of the faithful is the faith of the 
Church, received from the apostles. Faith is a treasure of life which is 
enriched by being shared. 

950 Communion of the sacraments. "The fruit of all the sacraments 
belongs to all the faithful. All the sacraments are sacred links uniting 
the faithful with one another and binding them to Jesus Christ, and 
above all Baptism, the gate by which we enter into the Church. the 
communion of saints must be understood as the communion of the 
sacraments.... the name 'communion' can be applied to all of them, for 
they unite us to God.... But this name is better suited to the Eucharist 
than to any other, because it is primarily the Eucharist that brings this 
communion about."481 

951 Communion of charisms. Within the communion of the Church, 
the Holy Spirit "distributes special graces among the faithful of every 
rank" for the building up of the Church.482 Now, "to each is given the 
manifestation of the Spirit for the common good."483 



952 "They had everything in common."484 "Everything the true 
Christian has is to be regarded as a good possessed in common with 
everyone else. All Christians should be ready and eager to come to the 
help of the needy . . . and of their neighbors in want."485 A Christian 
is a steward of the Lord's goods.486 

953 Communion in charity. In the sanctorum communio, "None of us 
lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself."487 "If one member 
suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice 
together. Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of 
it."488 "Charity does not insist on its own way."489 In this solidarity 
with all men, living or dead, which is founded on the communion of 
saints, the least of our acts done in charity redounds to the profit of all. 
Every sin harms this communion. 

II. THE COMMUNION OF THE CHURCH OF HEAVEN AND 
EARTH 

954 The three states of the Church. "When the Lord comes in glory, 
and all his angels with him, death will be no more and all things will be 
subject to him. But at the present time some of his disciples are 
pilgrims on earth. Others have died and are being purified, while still 
others are in glory, contemplating 'in full light, God himself triune and 
one, exactly as he is"':490 

All of us, however, in varying degrees and in different ways share in the 
same charity towards God and our neighbours, and we all sing the one 
hymn of glory to our God. All, indeed, who are of Christ and who have 
his Spirit form one Church and in Christ cleave together.491 

955 "So it is that the union of the wayfarers with the brethren who 
sleep in the peace of Christ is in no way interrupted, but on the 
contrary, according to the constant faith of the Church, this union is 
reinforced by an exchange of spiritual goods."492 

956 The intercession of the saints. "Being more closely united to 
Christ, those who dwell in heaven fix the whole Church more firmly in 
holiness.... They do not cease to intercede with the Father for us, as 
they proffer the merits which they acquired on earth through the one 
mediator between God and men, Christ Jesus.... So by their fraternal 
concern is our weakness greatly helped."493 



Do not weep, for I shall be more useful to you after my death and I 
shall help you then more effectively than during my life.494 

  

I want to spend my heaven in doing good on earth.495 

957 Communion with the saints. "It is not merely by the title of 
example that we cherish the memory of those in heaven; we seek, 
rather, that by this devotion to the exercise of fraternal charity the 
union of the whole Church in the Spirit may be strengthened. Exactly 
as Christian communion among our fellow pilgrims brings us closer to 
Christ, so our communion with the saints joins us to Christ, from 
whom as from its fountain and head issues all grace, and the life of the 
People of God itself"496: 

We worship Christ as God's Son; we love the martyró as the Lord's 
disciples and imitators, and rightly so because of their matchless 
devotion towards their king and master. May we also be their 
companions and fellow disciples!497 

958 Communion with the dead. "In full consciousness of this 
communion of the whole Mystical Body of Jesus Christ, the Church in 
its pilgrim members, from the very earliest days of the Christian 
religion, has honored with great respect the memory of the dead; and 
'because it is a holy and a wholesome thought to pray for the dead that 
they may be loosed from their sins' she offers her suffrages for 
them."498 Our prayer for them is capable not only of helping them, 
but also of making their intercession for us effective. 

959 In the one family of God. "For if we continue to love one another 
and to join in praising the Most Holy Trinity - all of us who are sons of 
God and form one family in Christ - we will be faithful to the deepest 
vocation of the Church."499 

IN BRIEF 

960 The Church is a "communion of saints": this expression refers first 
to the "holy things" (sancta), above all the Eucharist, by which "the 
unity of believers, who form one body in Christ, is both represented 
and brought about" (LG 3). 



961 The term "communion of saints" refers also to the communion of 
"holy persons" (sancti) in Christ who "died for all," so that what each 
one does or suffers in and for Christ bears fruit for all. 

962 "We believe in the communion of all the faithful of Christ, those 
who are pilgrims on earth, the dead who are being purified, and the 
blessed in heaven, all together forming one Church; and we believe 
that in this communion, the merciful love of God and his saints is 
always [attentive] to our prayers" (Paul VI, CPG # 30).

CHAPTER THREE I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT 

 

 

 

Article 9 "I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH" 

 

 



Paragraph 6. MARY - MOTHER OF CHRIST, MOTHER OF THE 
CHURCH 

963 Since the Virgin Mary's role in the mystery of Christ and the Spirit 
has been treated, it is fitting now to consider her place in the mystery 
of the Church. "The Virgin Mary . . . is acknowledged and honored as 
being truly the Mother of God and of the redeemer.... She is 'clearly 
the mother of the members of Christ' ... since she has by her charity 
joined in bringing about the birth of believers in the Church, who are 
members of its head."500 "Mary, Mother of Christ, Mother of the 
Church."501 

I. MARY'S MOTHERHOOD WITH REGARD TO THE CHURCH 

Wholly united with her Son . . . 

964 Mary's role in the Church is inseparable from her union with 
Christ and flows directly from it. "This union of the mother with the 
Son in the work of salvation is made manifest from the time of Christ's 
virginal conception up to his death";502 it is made manifest above all 
at the hour of his Passion: 

Thus the Blessed Virgin advanced in her pilgrimage of faith, and 
faithfully persevered in her union with her Son unto the cross. There 
she stood, in keeping with the divine plan, enduring with her only 
begotten Son the intensity of his suffering, joining herself with his 
sacrifice in her mother's heart, and lovingly consenting to the 
immolation of this victim, born of her: to be given, by the same Christ 
Jesus dying on the cross, as a mother to his disciple, with these words: 
"Woman, behold your son."503 

965 After her Son's Ascension, Mary "aided the beginnings of the 
Church by her prayers."504 In her association with the apostles and 
several women, "we also see Mary by her prayers imploring the gift of 
the Spirit, who had already overshadowed her in the 
Annunciation."505 

. . . also in her Assumption 

966 "Finally the Immaculate Virgin, preserved free from all stain of 
original sin, when the course of her earthly life was finished, was taken 
up body and soul into heavenly glory, and exalted by the Lord as 



Queen over all things, so that she might be the more fully conformed 
to her Son, the Lord of lords and conqueror of sin and death."506 The 
Assumption of the Blessed Virgin is a singular participation in her 
Son's Resurrection and an anticipation of the resurrection of other 
Christians: 

In giving birth you kept your virginity; in your Dormition you did not 
leave the world, O Mother of God, but were joined to the source of 
Life. You conceived the living God and, by your prayers, will deliver 
our souls from death.507 

. . . she is our Mother in the order of grace 

967 By her complete adherence to the Father's will, to his Son's 
redemptive work, and to every prompting of the Holy Spirit, the Virgin 
Mary is the Church's model of faith and charity. Thus she is a 
"preeminent and . . . wholly unique member of the Church"; indeed, 
she is the "exemplary realization" (typus)508 of the Church. 

968 Her role in relation to the Church and to all humanity goes still 
further. "In a wholly singular way she cooperated by her obedience, 
faith, hope, and burning charity in the Savior's work of restoring 
supernatural life to souls. For this reason she is a mother to us in the 
order of grace."509 

969 "This motherhood of Mary in the order of grace continues 
uninterruptedly from the consent which she loyally gave at the 
Annunciation and which she sustained without wavering beneath the 
cross, until the eternal fulfilment of all the elect. Taken up to heaven 
she did not lay aside this saving office but by her manifold intercession 
continues to bring us the gifts of eternal salvation .... Therefore the 
Blessed Virgin is invoked in the Church under the titles of Advocate, 
Helper, Benefactress, and Mediatrix."510 

970 "Mary's function as mother of men in no way obscures or 
diminishes this unique mediation of Christ, but rather shows its power. 
But the Blessed Virgin's salutary influence on men . . . flows forth from 
the superabundance of the merits of Christ, rests on his mediation, 
depends entirely on it, and draws all its power from it."511 "No 
creature could ever be counted along with the Incarnate Word and 
Redeemer; but just as the priesthood of Christ is shared in various 



ways both by his ministers and the faithful, and as the one goodness of 
God is radiated in different ways among his creatures, so also the 
unique mediation of the Redeemer does not exclude but rather gives 
rise to a manifold cooperation which is but a sharing in this one 
source."512 

II. DEVOTION TO THE BLESSED VIRGIN 

971 "All generations will call me blessed": "The Church's devotion to 
the Blessed Virgin is intrinsic to Christian worship."513 The Church 
rightly honors "the Blessed Virgin with special devotion. From the 
most ancient times the Blessed Virgin has been honored with the title 
of 'Mother of God,' to whose protection the faithful fly in all their 
dangers and needs.... This very special devotion ... differs essentially 
from the adoration which is given to the incarnate Word and equally to 
the Father and the Holy Spirit, and greatly fosters this adoration."514 
The liturgical feasts dedicated to the Mother of God and Marian 
prayer, such as the rosary, an "epitome of the whole Gospel," express 
this devotion to the Virgin Mary.515 

III. MARY - ESCHATOLOGICAL ICON OF THE CHURCH 

972 After speaking of the Church, her origin, mission, and destiny, we 
can find no better way to conclude than by looking to Mary. In her we 
contemplate what the Church already is in her mystery on her own 
"pilgrimage of faith," and what she will be in the homeland at the end 
of her journey. There, "in the glory of the Most Holy and Undivided 
Trinity," "in the communion of all the saints,"516 The Church is 
awaited by the one she venerates as Mother of her Lord and as her 
own mother. 

In the meantime the Mother of Jesus, in the glory which she possesses 
in body and soul in heaven, is the image and beginning of the Church 
as it is to be perfected in the world to come. Likewise she shines forth 
on earth until the day of the Lord shall come, a sign of certain hope 
and comfort to the pilgrim People of God.517 

IN BRIEF 

973 By pronouncing her "fiat" at the Annunciation and giving her 
consent to the Incarnation, Mary was al ready collaborating with the 



whole work her Son was to accomplish. She is mother wherever he is 
Savior and head of the Mystical Body. 

974 The Most Blessed Virgin Mary, when the course of her earthly life 
was completed, was taken up body and soul into the glory of heaven, 
where she already shares in the glory of her Son's Resurrection, 
anticipating the resurrection of all members of his Body. 

975 "We believe that the Holy Mother of God, the new Eve, Mother of 
the Church, continues in heaven to exercise her maternal role on 
behalf of the members of Christ" (Paul VI, CPG # 15).

Article 10 "I BELIEVE IN THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS" 

976 The Apostle's Creed associates faith in the forgiveness of sins not 
only with faith in the Holy Spirit, but also with faith in the Church and 
in the communion of saints. It was when he gave the Holy Spirit to his 
apostles that the risen Christ conferred on them his own divine power 
to forgive sins: "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, 
they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained."518 

(Part Two of the catechism will deal explicitly with the forgiveness of 
sins through Baptism, the sacrament of Penance, and the other 
sacraments, especially the Eucharist. Here it will suffice to suggest 
some basic facts briefly.)

Article 10 "I BELIEVE IN THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS" 

 

 

I. One Baptism for the Forgiveness of Sins 

977 Our Lord tied the forgiveness of sins to faith and Baptism: "Go 
into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation. He who 
believes and is baptized will be saved."519 Baptism is the first and 
chief sacrament of forgiveness of sins because it unites us with Christ, 
who died for our sins and rose for our justification, so that "we too 
might walk in newness of life."520 

978 "When we made our first profession of faith while receiving the 
holy Baptism that cleansed us, the forgiveness we received then was so 



full and complete that there remained in us absolutely nothing left to 
efface, neither original sin nor offenses committed by our own will, nor 
was there left any penalty to suffer in order to expiate them.... Yet the 
grace of Baptism delivers no one from all the weakness of nature. On 
the contrary, we must still combat the movements of concupiscence 
that never cease leading us into evil "521 

979 In this battle against our inclination towards evil, who could be 
brave and watchful enough to escape every wound of sin? "If the 
Church has the power to forgive sins, then Baptism cannot be her only 
means of using the keys of the Kingdom of heaven received from Jesus 
Christ. the Church must be able to forgive all penitents their offenses, 
even if they should sin until the last moment of their lives."522 

980 It is through the sacrament of Penance that the baptized can be 
reconciled with God and with the Church: 

Penance has rightly been called by the holy Fathers "a laborious kind 
of baptism." This sacrament of Penance is necessary for salvation for 
those who have fallen after Baptism, just as Baptism is necessary for 
salvation for those who have not yet been reborn.523

II. The Power of the Keys 

981 After his Resurrection, Christ sent his apostles "so that repentance 
and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all 
nations."524 The apostles and their successors carry out this "ministry 
of reconciliation," not only by announcing to men God's forgiveness 
merited for us by Christ, and calling them to conversion and faith; but 
also by communicating to them the forgiveness of sins in Baptism, and 
reconciling them with God and with the Church through the power of 
the keys, received from Christ:525 

[The Church] has received the keys of the Kingdom of heaven so that, 
in her, sins may be forgiven through Christ's blood and the Holy 
Spirit's action. In this Church, the soul dead through sin comes back to 
life in order to live with Christ, whose grace has saved us.526 

982 There is no offense, however serious, that the Church cannot 
forgive. "There is no one, however wicked and guilty, who may not 
confidently hope for forgiveness, provided his repentance is honest.527 
Christ who died for all men desires that in his Church the gates of 
forgiveness should always be open to anyone who turns away from 
sin.528 

983 Catechesis strives to awaken and nourish in the faithful faith in the 
incomparable greatness of the risen Christ's gift to his Church: the 
mission and the power to forgive sins through the ministry of the 
apostles and their successors: 

The Lord wills that his disciples possess a tremendous power: that his 
lowly servants accomplish in his name all that he did when he was on 
earth.529  

Priests have received from God a power that he has given neither to 
angels nor to archangels .... God above confirms what priests do here 
below.530  



Were there no forgiveness of sins in the Church, there would be no 
hope of life to come or eternal liberation. Let us thank God who has 
given his Church such a gift.531 

984 The Creed links "the forgiveness of sins" with its profession of 
faith in the Holy Spirit, for the risen Christ entrusted to the apostles 
the power to forgive sins when he gave them the Holy Spirit. 

985 Baptism is the first and chief sacrament of the forgiveness of sins: 
it unites us to Christ, who died and rose, and gives us the Holy Spirit. 

986 By Christ's will, the Church possesses the power to forgive the sins 
of the baptized and exercises it through bishops and priests normally in 
the sacrament of Penance. 

987 "In the forgiveness of sins, both priests and sacraments are 
instruments which our Lord Jesus Christ, the only author and liberal 
giver of salvation, wills to use in order to efface our sins and give us the 
grace of justification" (Roman Catechism, I, 11, 6).

CHAPTER THREE I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT 

 

 

Article 11 "I BELIEVE IN THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY" 

988 The Christian Creed - the profession of our faith in God, the 
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and in God's creative, saving, and 
sanctifying action - culminates in the proclamation of the resurrection 
of the dead on the last day and in life everlasting. 

989 We firmly believe, and hence we hope that, just as Christ is truly 
risen from the dead and lives for ever, so after death the righteous will 
live for ever with the risen Christ and he will raise them up on the last 
day.532 Our resurrection, like his own, will be the work of the Most 
Holy Trinity: 

If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he 
who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life to your mortal 
bodies also through his Spirit who dwells in you.533 

990 The term "flesh" refers to man in his state of weakness and 
mortality.534 The "resurrection of the flesh" (the literal formulation of 
the Apostles' Creed) means not only that the immortal soul will live on 
after death, but that even our "mortal body" will come to life again.535 

991 Belief in the resurrection of the dead has been an essential element 
of the Christian faith from its beginnings. "The confidence of 
Christians is the resurrection of the dead; believing this we live."536  

How can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? But 
if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised; 
if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your 
faith is in vain.... But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the 
first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.537

I. Christ's Resurrection and Ours 

The progressive revelation of the Resurrection 

992 God revealed the resurrection of the dead to his people 
progressively. Hope in the bodily resurrection of the dead established 
itself as a consequence intrinsic to faith in God as creator of the whole 
man, soul and body. the creator of heaven and earth is also the one 
who faithfully maintains his covenant with Abraham and his posterity. 
It was in this double perspective that faith in the resurrection came to 
be expressed. In their trials, the Maccabean martyrs confessed: 

The King of the universe will raise us up to an everlasting renewal of 
life, because we have died for his laws.538 One cannot but choose to 



die at the hands of men and to cherish the hope that God gives of 
being raised again by him.539 

993 The Pharisees and many of the Lord's contemporaries hoped for 
the resurrection. Jesus teaches it firmly. To the Sadducees who deny it 
he answers, "Is not this why you are wrong, that you know neither the 
scriptures nor the power of God?"540 Faith in the resurrection rests on 
faith in God who "is not God of the dead, but of the living."541 

994 But there is more. Jesus links faith in the resurrection to his own 
person: "I am the Resurrection and the life."542 It is Jesus himself who 
on the last day will raise up those who have believed in him, who have 
eaten his body and drunk his blood.543 Already now in this present 
life he gives a sign and pledge of this by restoring some of the dead to 
life,544 announcing thereby his own Resurrection, though it was to be 
of another order. He speaks of this unique event as the "sign of 
Jonah,"545 The sign of the temple: he announces that he will be put to 
death but rise thereafter on the third day.546 

995 To be a witness to Christ is to be a "witness to his Resurrection," 
to "[have eaten and drunk] with him after he rose from the dead."547 
Encounters with the risen Christ characterize the Christian hope of 
resurrection. We shall rise like Christ, with him, and through him. 

996 From the beginning, Christian faith in the resurrection has met 
with incomprehension and opposition.548 "On no point does the 
Christian faith encounter more opposition than on the resurrection of 
the body."549 It is very commonly accepted that the life of the human 
person continues in a spiritual fashion after death. But how can we 
believe that this body, so clearly mortal, could rise to everlasting life? 

How do the dead rise? 

997 What is "rising"? In death, the separation of the soul from the 
body, the human body decays and the soul goes to meet God, while 
awaiting its reunion with its glorified body. God, in his almighty power, 
will definitively grant incorruptible life to our bodies by reuniting them 
with our souls, through the power of Jesus' Resurrection. 



998 Who will rise? All the dead will rise, "those who have done good, to 
the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the 
resurrection of judgment."550 

999 How? Christ is raised with his own body: "See my hands and my 
feet, that it is I myself";551 but he did not return to an earthly life. So, 
in him, "all of them will rise again with their own bodies which they 
now bear," but Christ "will change our lowly body to be like his 
glorious body," into a "spiritual body":552 

But someone will ask, "How are the dead raised? With what kind of 
body do they come?" You foolish man! What you sow does not come to 
life unless it dies. and what you sow is not the body which is to be, but 
a bare kernel ....What is sown is perishable, what is raised is 
imperishable.... the dead will be raised imperishable.... For this 
perishable nature must put on the imperishable, and this mortal nature 
must put on immortality.553 

1000 This "how" exceeds our imagination and understanding; it is 
accessible only to faith. Yet our participation in the Eucharist already 
gives us a foretaste of Christ's transfiguration of our bodies: 

Just as bread that comes from the earth, after God's blessing has been 
invoked upon it, is no longer ordinary bread, but Eucharist, formed of 
two things, the one earthly and the other heavenly: so too our bodies, 
which partake of the Eucharist, are no longer corruptible, but possess 
the hope of resurrection.554 

1001 When? Definitively "at the last day," "at the end of the world."555 
Indeed, the resurrection of the dead is closely associated with Christ's 
Parousia: 

For the Lord himself will descend from heaven, with a cry of 
command, with the archangel's call, and with the sound of the trumpet 
of God. and the dead in Christ will rise first.556 

Risen with Christ 

1002 Christ will raise us up "on the last day"; but it is also true that, in 
a certain way, we have already risen with Christ. For, by virtue of the 
Holy Spirit, Christian life is already now on earth a participation in the 
death and Resurrection of Christ: 



And you were buried with him in Baptism, in which you were also 
raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him 
from the dead .... If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the 
things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of 
God.557 

1003 United with Christ by Baptism, believers already truly participate 
in the heavenly life of the risen Christ, but this life remains "hidden 
with Christ in God."558 The Father has already "raised us up with 
him, and made us sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ 
Jesus."559 Nourished with his body in the Eucharist, we already 
belong to the Body of Christ. When we rise on the last day we "also will 
appear with him in glory."560 

1004 In expectation of that day, the believer's body and soul already 
participate in the dignity of belonging to Christ. This dignity entails the 
demand that he should treat with respect his own body, but also the 
body of every other person, especially the suffering: 

The body [is meant] for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. and God 
raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power. Do you not 
know that your bodies are members of Christ? .... You are not your 
own; .... So glorify God in your body.561

Article 11 "I BELIEVE IN THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY" 

 

 

II. Dying in Christ Jesus 

1005 To rise with Christ, we must die with Christ: we must "be away 
from the body and at home with the Lord."562 In that "departure" 
which is death the soul is separated from the body.563 It will be 
reunited with the body on the day of resurrection of the dead.564 

Death 

1006 "It is in regard to death that man's condition is most shrouded in 
doubt."565 In a sense bodily death is natural, but for faith it is in fact 
"the wages of sin."566 For those who die in Christ's grace it is a 
participation in the death of the Lord, so that they can also share his 
Resurrection.567 

1007 Death is the end of earthly life. Our lives are measured by time, 
in the course of which we change, grow old and, as with all living 
beings on earth, death seems like the normal end of life. That aspect of 
death lends urgency to our lives: remembering our mortality helps us 
realize that we have only a limited time in which to bring our lives to 
fulfillment: 

Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, . . . before the 
dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who 
gave it.568 

1008 Death is a consequence of sin. the Church's Magisterium, as 
authentic interpreter of the affirmations of Scripture and Tradition, 



teaches that death entered the world on account of man's sin.569 Even 
though man's nature is mortal God had destined him not to die. Death 
was therefore contrary to the plans of God the Creator and entered the 
world as a consequence of sin.570 "Bodily death, from which man 
would have been immune had he not sinned" is thus "the last enemy" 
of man left to be conquered.571 

1009 Death is transformed by Christ. Jesus, the Son of God, also 
himself suffered the death that is part of the human condition. Yet, 
despite his anguish as he faced death, he accepted it in an act of 
complete and free submission to his Father's will.572 The obedience of 
Jesus has transformed the curse of death into a blessing.573 

The meaning of Christian death 

1010 Because of Christ, Christian death has a positive meaning: "For 
to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain."574 "The saying is sure: if we 
have died with him, we will also live with him.575 What is essentially 
new about Christian death is this: through Baptism, the Christian has 
already "died with Christ" sacramentally, in order to live a new life; and 
if we die in Christ's grace, physical death completes this "dying with 
Christ" and so completes our incorporation into him in his redeeming 
act: 

It is better for me to die in (eis) Christ Jesus than to reign over the 
ends of the earth. Him it is I seek - who died for us. Him it is I desire - 
who rose for us. I am on the point of giving birth .... Let me receive 
pure light; when I shall have arrived there, then shall I be a man.576 

1011 In death, God calls man to himself. Therefore the Christian can 
experience a desire for death like St. Paul's: "My desire is to depart and 
be with Christ. "577 He can transform his own death into an act of 
obedience and love towards the Father, after the example of Christ:578 

My earthly desire has been crucified; . . . there is living water in me, 
water that murmurs and says within me: Come to the Father.579  

I want to see God and, in order to see him, I must die.580  

I am not dying; I am entering life.581 



1012 The Christian vision of death receives privileged expression in the 
liturgy of the Church:582 

Lord, for your faithful people life is changed, not ended. When the 
body of our earthly dwelling lies in death we gain an everlasting 
dwelling place in heaven.583 

1013 Death is the end of man's earthly pilgrimage, of the time of grace 
and mercy which God offers him so as to work out his earthly life in 
keeping with the divine plan, and to decide his ultimate destiny. When 
"the single course of our earthly life" is completed,584 we shall not 
return to other earthly lives: "It is appointed for men to die once."585 
There is no "reincarnation" after death. 

1014 The Church encourages us to prepare ourselves for the hour of 
our death. In the ancient litany of the saints, for instance, she has us 
pray: "From a sudden and unforeseen death, deliver us, O Lord";586 
to ask the Mother of God to intercede for us "at the hour of our death" 
in the Hail Mary; and to entrust ourselves to St. Joseph, the patron of a 
happy death. 

Every action of yours, every thought, should be those of one who 
expects to die before the day is out. Death would have no great terrors 
for you if you had a quiet conscience .... Then why not keep clear of sin 
instead of running away from death? If you aren't fit to face death 
today, it's very unlikely you will be tomorrow ....587  

Praised are you, my Lord, for our sister bodily Death, 

from whom no living man can escape. 

Woe on those who will die in mortal sin! 

Blessed are they who will be found in your most holy will, 

for the second death will not harm them.588

Article 11 "I BELIEVE IN THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY" 



 

 

IN BRIEF 

1015 "The flesh is the hinge of salvation" (Tertullian, De res. 8, 2: PL 
2, 852). We believe in God who is creator of the flesh; we believe in the 
Word made flesh in order to redeem the flesh; we believe in the 
resurrection of the flesh, the fulfillment of both the creation and the 
redemption of the flesh. 

1016 By death the soul is separated from the body, but in the 
resurrection God will give incorruptible life to our body, transformed 
by reunion with our soul. Just as Christ is risen and lives for ever, so all 
of us will rise at the last day. 

1017 "We believe in the true resurrection of this flesh that we now 
possess" (Council of Lyons II: DS 854). We sow a corruptible body in 
the tomb, but he raises up an incorruptible body, a "spiritual body" (cf 
1 Cor 15:42-44). 

1018 As a consequence of original sin, man must suffer "bodily death, 
from which man would have been immune had he not sinned" (GS # 
18). 

1019 Jesus, the Son of God, freely suffered death for us in complete 
and free submission to the will of God, his Father. By his death he has 
conquered death, and so opened the possibility of salvation to all men.

Article 12 "I BELIEVE IN LIFE EVERLASTING" 

1020 The Christian who unites his own death to that of Jesus views it 
as a step towards him and an entrance into everlasting life. When the 
Church for the last time speaks Christ's words of pardon and 
absolution over the dying Christian, seals him for the last time with a 
strengthening anointing, and gives him Christ in viaticum as 
nourishment for the journey, she speaks with gentle assurance: 

Go forth, Christian soul, from this world 

in the name of God the almighty Father, 

who created you, 

in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, 

who suffered for you, 

in the name of the Holy Spirit, 

who was poured out upon you. 



Go forth, faithful Christian!  

May you live in peace this day, 

may your home be with God in Zion, 

with Mary, the virgin Mother of God, 

with Joseph, and all the angels and saints....  

May you return to [your Creator] 

who formed you from the dust of the earth. 

May holy Mary, the angels, and all the saints 

come to meet you as you go forth from this life....  

May you see your Redeemer face to face. 589

I. The Particular Judgment 

1021 Death puts an end to human life as the time open to either 
accepting or rejecting the divine grace manifested in Christ.590 The 
New Testament speaks of judgment primarily in its aspect of the final 
encounter with Christ in his second coming, but also repeatedly 
affirms that each will be rewarded immediately after death in 
accordance with his works and faith. the parable of the poor man 
Lazarus and the words of Christ on the cross to the good thief, as well 
as other New Testament texts speak of a final destiny of the soul -a 
destiny which can be different for some and for others.591 

1022 Each man receives his eternal retribution in his immortal soul at 
the very moment of his death, in a particular judgment that refers his 
life to Christ: either entrance into the blessedness of heaven-through a 
purification592 or immediately,593-or immediate and everlasting 
damnation.594 

At the evening of life, we shall be judged on our love.595

II. Heaven 

1023 Those who die in God's grace and friendship and are perfectly 
purified live for ever with Christ. They are like God for ever, for they 
"see him as he is," face to face:596 

By virtue of our apostolic authority, we define the following: According 
to the general disposition of God, the souls of all the saints . . . and 
other faithful who died after receiving Christ's holy Baptism (provided 
they were not in need of purification when they died, . . . or, if they 
then did need or will need some purification, when they have been 



purified after death, . . .) already before they take up their bodies again 
and before the general judgment - and this since the Ascension of our 
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ into heaven - have been, are and will be 
in heaven, in the heavenly Kingdom and celestial paradise with Christ, 
joined to the company of the holy angels. Since the Passion and death 
of our Lord Jesus Christ, these souls have seen and do see the divine 
essence with an intuitive vision, and even face to face, without the 
mediation of any creature.597 

1024 This perfect life with the Most Holy Trinity - this communion of 
life and love with the Trinity, with the Virgin Mary, the angels and all 
the blessed - is called "heaven." Heaven is the ultimate end and 
fulfillment of the deepest human longings, the state of supreme, 
definitive happiness. 

1025 To live in heaven is "to be with Christ." the elect live "in 
Christ,"598 but they retain, or rather find, their true identity, their own 
name.599 

For life is to be with Christ; where Christ is, there is life, there is the 
kingdom.600 

1026 By his death and Resurrection, Jesus Christ has "opened" heaven 
to us. the life of the blessed consists in the full and perfect possession 
of the fruits of the redemption accomplished by Christ. He makes 
partners in his heavenly glorification those who have believed in him 
and remained faithful to his will. Heaven is the blessed community of 
all who are perfectly incorporated into Christ. 

1027 This mystery of blessed communion with God and all who are in 
Christ is beyond all understanding and description. Scripture speaks of 
it in images: life, light, peace, wedding feast, wine of the kingdom, the 
Father's house, the heavenly Jerusalem, paradise: "no eye has seen, nor 
ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, what God has prepared for 
those who love him."601 

1028 Because of his transcendence, God cannot be seen as he is, 
unless he himself opens up his mystery to man's immediate 
contemplation and gives him the capacity for it. the Church calls this 
contemplation of God in his heavenly glory "the beatific vision": 



How great will your glory and happiness be, to be allowed to see God, 
to be honored with sharing the joy of salvation and eternal light with 
Christ your Lord and God, . . . to delight in the joy of immortality in 
the Kingdom of heaven with the righteous and God's friends.602 

1029 In the glory of heaven the blessed continue joyfully to fulfill 
God's will in relation to other men and to all creation. Already they 
reign with Christ; with him "they shall reign for ever and ever."603

III. The Final Purification, or Purgatory 

1030 All who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly 
purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death 
they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to 
enter the joy of heaven. 

1031 The Church gives the name Purgatory to this final purification of 
the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the 
damned.604 The Church formulated her doctrine of faith on 
Purgatory especially at the Councils of Florence and Trent. the 
tradition of the Church, by reference to certain texts of Scripture, 
speaks of a cleansing fire:605 

As for certain lesser faults, we must believe that, before the Final 
Judgment, there is a purifying fire. He who is truth says that whoever 
utters blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will be pardoned neither in 
this age nor in the age to come. From this sentence we understand that 
certain offenses can be forgiven in this age, but certain others in the 
age to come.606 

1032 This teaching is also based on the practice of prayer for the dead, 
already mentioned in Sacred Scripture: "Therefore Judas Maccabeus] 
made atonement for the dead, that they might be delivered from their 
sin."607 From the beginning the Church has honored the memory of 
the dead and offered prayers in suffrage for them, above all the 
Eucharistic sacrifice, so that, thus purified, they may attain the beatific 
vision of God.608 The Church also commends almsgiving, 
indulgences, and works of penance undertaken on behalf of the dead: 

Let us help and commemorate them. If Job's sons were purified by 
their father's sacrifice, why would we doubt that our offerings for the 
dead bring them some consolation? Let us not hesitate to help those 
who have died and to offer our prayers for them.609

IV. Hell 

1033 We cannot be united with God unless we freely choose to love 
him. But we cannot love God if we sin gravely against him, against our 
neighbor or against ourselves: "He who does not love remains in death. 
Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no 
murderer has eternal life abiding in him."610 Our Lord warns us that 
we shall be separated from him if we fail to meet the serious needs of 
the poor and the little ones who are his brethren.611 To die in mortal 



sin without repenting and accepting God's merciful love means 
remaining separated from him for ever by our own free choice. This 
state of definitive self-exclusion from communion with God and the 
blessed is called "hell." 

1034 Jesus often speaks of "Gehenna" of "the unquenchable fire" 
reserved for those who to the end of their lives refuse to believe and be 
converted, where both soul and body can be lost.612 Jesus solemnly 
proclaims that he "will send his angels, and they will gather . . . all evil 
doers, and throw them into the furnace of fire,"613 and that he will 
pronounce the condemnation: "Depart from me, you cursed, into the 
eternal fire!"614 

1035 The teaching of the Church affirms the existence of hell and its 
eternity. Immediately after death the souls of those who die in a state 
of mortal sin descend into hell, where they suffer the punishments of 
hell, "eternal fire."615 The chief punishment of hell is eternal 
separation from God, in whom alone man can possess the life and 
happiness for which he was created and for which he longs. 

1036 The affirmations of Sacred Scripture and the teachings of the 
Church on the subject of hell are a call to the responsibility incumbent 
upon man to make use of his freedom in view of his eternal destiny. 
They are at the same time an urgent call to conversion: "Enter by the 
narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is easy, that leads to 
destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow 
and the way is hard, that leads to life, and those who find it are 
few."616 

Since we know neither the day nor the hour, we should follow the 
advice of the Lord and watch constantly so that, when the single 
course of our earthly life is completed, we may merit to enter with him 
into the marriage feast and be numbered among the blessed, and not, 
like the wicked and slothful servants, be ordered to depart into the 
eternal fire, into the outer darkness where "men will weep and gnash 
their teeth."617 

1037 God predestines no one to go to hell;618 for this, a willful 
turning away from God (a mortal sin) is necessary, and persistence in 
it until the end. In the Eucharistic liturgy and in the daily prayers of 



her faithful, the Church implores the mercy of God, who does not 
want "any to perish, but all to come to repentance":619 

Father, accept this offering 

from your whole family. 

Grant us your peace in this life, 

save us from final damnation, 

and count us among those you have chosen.620

V. The Last Judgment 

1038 The resurrection of all the dead, "of both the just and the 
unjust,"621 will precede the Last Judgment. This will be "the hour 
when all who are in the tombs will hear [the Son of man's] voice and 
come forth, those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and 
those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment."622 Then 
Christ will come "in his glory, and all the angels with him .... Before 
him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate them one 
from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, and he 
will place the sheep at his right hand, but the goats at the left.... and 
they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into 
eternal life."623 

1039 In the presence of Christ, who is Truth itself, the truth of each 
man's relationship with God will be laid bare.624 The Last Judgment 
will reveal even to its furthest consequences the good each person has 



done or failed to do during his earthly life: 
 

All that the wicked do is recorded, and they do not know. When "our 
God comes, he does not keep silence.". . . he will turn towards those at 
his left hand: . . . "I placed my poor little ones on earth for you. I as 
their head was seated in heaven at the right hand of my Father - but on 
earth my members were suffering, my members on earth were in need. 
If you gave anything to my members, what you gave would reach their 
Head. Would that you had known that my little ones were in need 
when I placed them on earth for you and appointed them your 
stewards to bring your good works into my treasury. But you have 
placed nothing in their hands; therefore you have found nothing in my 
presence."625 

1040 The Last Judgment will come when Christ returns in glory. Only 
the Father knows the day and the hour; only he determines the 
moment of its coming. Then through his Son Jesus Christ he will 
pronounce the final word on all history. We shall know the ultimate 
meaning of the whole work of creation and of the entire economy of 
salvation and understand the marvellous ways by which his Providence 
led everything towards its final end. the Last Judgment will reveal that 
God's justice triumphs over all the injustices committed by his 
creatures and that God's love is stronger than death.626 

1041 The message of the Last Judgment calls men to conversion while 
God is still giving them "the acceptable time, . . . the day of 
salvation."627 It inspires a holy fear of God and commits them to the 
justice of the Kingdom of God. It proclaims the "blessed hope" of the 
Lord's return, when he will come "to be glorified in his saints, and to 
be marvelled at in all who have believed."628

VI. Hope of the New Heaven and the New Earth 

1042 At the end of time, the Kingdom of God will come in its fullness. 
After the universal judgment, the righteous will reign for ever with 
Christ, glorified in body and soul. the universe itself will be renewed: 

The Church . . . will receive her perfection only in the glory of heaven, 
when will come the time of the renewal of all things. At that time, 
together with the human race, the universe itself, which is so closely 
related to man and which attains its destiny through him, will be 
perfectly re-established in Christ.629 



1043 Sacred Scripture calls this mysterious renewal, which will 
transform humanity and the world, "new heavens and a new 
earth."630 It will be the definitive realization of God's plan to bring 
under a single head "all things in [Christ], things in heaven and things 
on earth."631 

1044 In this new universe, the heavenly Jerusalem, God will have his 
dwelling among men.632 "He will wipe away every tear from their 
eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor 
crying nor pain any more, for the former things have passed away."633 

1045 For man, this consummation will be the final realization of the 
unity of the human race, which God willed from creation and of which 
the pilgrim Church has been "in the nature of sacrament."634 Those 
who are united with Christ will form the community of the redeemed, 
"the holy city" of God, "the Bride, the wife of the Lamb."635 She will 
not be wounded any longer by sin, stains, self-love, that destroy or 
wound the earthly community.636 The beatific vision, in which God 
opens himself in an inexhaustible way to the elect, will be the ever-
flowing well-spring of happiness, peace, and mutual communion. 

1046 For the cosmos, Revelation affirms the profound common 
destiny of the material world and man: 

For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons 
of God . . . in hope because the creation itself will be set free from its 
bondage to decay.... We know that the whole creation has been 
groaning in travail together until now; and not only the creation, but 
we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as 
we wait for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.637 

1047 The visible universe, then, is itself destined to be transformed, "so 
that the world itself, restored to its original state, facing no further 
obstacles, should be at the service of the just," sharing their 
glorification in the risen Jesus Christ.638 
 

1048 "We know neither the moment of the consummation of the earth 
and of man, nor the way in which the universe will be transformed. the 
form of this world, distorted by sin, is passing away, and we are taught 
that God is preparing a new dwelling and a new earth in which 



righteousness dwells, in which happiness will fill and surpass all the 
desires of peace arising in the hearts of men."639 

1049 "Far from diminishing our concern to develop this earth, the 
expectancy of a new earth should spur us on, for it is here that the 
body of a new human family grows, foreshadowing in some way the 
age which is to come. That is why, although we must be careful to 
distinguish earthly progress clearly from the increase of the kingdom of 
Christ, such progress is of vital concern to the kingdom of God, insofar 
as it can contribute to the better ordering of human society."640 

1050 "When we have spread on earth the fruits of our nature and our 
enterprise . . . according to the command of the Lord and in his Spirit, 
we will find them once again, cleansed this time from the stain of sin, 
illuminated and transfigured, when Christ presents to his Father an 
eternal and universal kingdom."641 God will then be "all in all" in 
eternal life:642 

True and subsistent life consists in this: the Father, through the Son 
and in the Holy Spirit, pouring out his heavenly gifts on all things 
without exception. Thanks to his mercy, we too, men that we are, have 
received the inalienable promise of eternal life.643

Article 12 "I BELIEVE IN LIFE EVERLASTING" 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

1051 Every man receives his eternal recompense in his immortal soul 
from the moment of his death in a particular judgment by Christ, the 
judge of the living and the dead. 

1052 "We believe that the souls of all who die in Christ's grace . . . are 
the People of God beyond death. On the day of resurrection, death will 
be definitively conquered, when these souls will be reunited with their 
bodies" (Paul VI, CPG # 28). 

1053 "We believe that the multitude of those gathered around Jesus 
and Mary in Paradise forms the Church of heaven, where in eternal 
blessedness they see God as he is and where they are also, to various 
degrees, associated with the holy angels in the divine governance 
exercised by Christ in glory, by interceding for us and helping our 
weakness by their fraternal concern" (Paul VI, CPG # 29). 

1054 Those who die in God's grace and friendship imperfectly 
purified, although they are assured of their eternal salvation, undergo a 
purification after death, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter 
the joy of God. 

1055 By virtue of the "communion of saints," the Church commends 
the dead to God's mercy and offers her prayers, especially the holy 
sacrifice of the Eucharist, on their behalf. 

1056 Following the example of Christ, the Church warns the faithful 
of the "sad and lamentable reality of eternal death" (GCD 69), also 
called "hell." 



1057 Hell's principal punishment consists of eternal separation from 
God in whom alone man can have the life and happiness for which he 
was created and for which he longs. 

1058 The Church prays that no one should be lost: "Lord, let me never 
be parted from you." If it is true that no one can save himself, it is also 
true that God "desires all men to be saved" (1 Tim 2:4), and that for 
him "all things are possible" (Mt 19:26). 

1059 "The holy Roman Church firmly believes and confesses that on 
the Day of Judgment all men will appear in their own bodies before 
Christ's tribunal to render an account of their own deeds" (Council of 
Lyons II [1274]: DS 859; cf. DS 1549). 

1060 At the end of time, the Kingdom of God will come in its fullness. 
Then the just will reign with Christ for ever, glorified in body and soul, 
and the material universe itself will be transformed. God will then be 
"all in all" (1 Cor 15:28), in eternal life.

Article 12 "I BELIEVE IN LIFE EVERLASTING" 

 

 

"Amen" 

1061 The Creed, like the last book of the Bible,644 ends with the 
Hebrew word amen. This word frequently concludes prayers in the 
New Testament. the Church likewise ends her prayers with "Amen." 

1062 In Hebrew, amen comes from the same root as the word 
"believe." This root expresses solidity, trustworthiness, faithfulness. and 
so we can understand why "Amen" may express both God's 
faithfulness towards us and our trust in him. 

1063 In the book of the prophet Isaiah, we find the expression "God of 
truth" (literally "God of the Amen"), that is, the God who is faithful to 
his promises: "He who blesses himself in the land shall bless himself by 
the God of truth [amen]."645 Our Lord often used the word "Amen," 
sometimes repeated,646 to emphasize the trustworthiness of his 
teaching, his authority founded on God's truth. 

1064 Thus the Creed's final "Amen" repeats and confirms its first 
words: "I believe." To believe is to say "Amen" to God's words, 
promises and commandments; to entrust oneself completely to him 
who is the "Amen" of infinite love and perfect faithfulness. the 
Christian's everyday life will then be the "Amen" to the "I believe" of 
our baptismal profession of faith: 



May your Creed be for you as a mirror. Look at yourself in it, to see if 
you believe everything you say you believe. and rejoice in your faith 
each day.647 

1065 Jesus Christ himself is the "Amen."648 He is the definitive 
"Amen" of the Father's love for us. He takes up and completes our 
"Amen" to the Father: "For all the promises of God find their Yes in 
him. That is why we utter the Amen through him, to the glory of 
God":649 

Through him, with him, in him, 

in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 

all glory and honor is yours, 

almighty Father, 

God, for ever and ever. 

AMEN.

PART TWO: THE CELEBRATION OF THE CHRISTIAN 
MYSTERY 

Why the liturgy? 

1066 In the Symbol of the faith the Church confesses the mystery of 
the Holy Trinity and of the plan of God's "good pleasure" for all 
creation: the Father accomplishes the "mystery of his will" by giving his 
beloved Son and his Holy Spirit for the salvation of the world and for 
the glory of his name.1 

Such is the mystery of Christ, revealed and fulfilled in history 
according to the wisely ordered plan that St. Paul calls the "plan of the 
mystery"2 and the patristic tradition will call the "economy of the Word 
incarnate" or the "economy of salvation." 

1067 "The wonderful works of God among the people of the Old 
Testament were but a prelude to the work of Christ the Lord in 
redeeming mankind and giving perfect glory to God. He accomplished 



this work principally by the Paschal mystery of his blessed Passion, 
Resurrection from the dead, and glorious Ascension, whereby 'dying he 
destroyed our death, rising he restored our life.' For it was from the 
side of Christ as he slept the sleep of death upon the cross that there 
came forth 'the wondrous sacrament of the whole Church."'3 

For this reason, the Church celebrates in the liturgy above all the 
Paschal mystery by which Christ accomplished the work of our 
salvation. 

1068 It is this mystery of Christ that the Church proclaims and 
celebrates in her liturgy so that the faithful may live from it and bear 
witness to it in the world: 

For it is in the liturgy, especially in the divine sacrifice of the Eucharist, 
that "the work of our redemption is accomplished," and it is through 
the liturgy especially that the faithful are enabled to express in their 
lives and manifest to others the mystery of Christ and the real nature 
of the true Church.4 

What does the word liturgy mean? 

1069 The word "liturgy" originally meant a "public work" or a "service 
in the name of/on behalf of the people."  

In Christian tradition it means the participation of the People of God 
in "the work of God."5  

Through the liturgy Christ, our redeemer and high priest, continues 
the work of our redemption in, with, and through his Church. 

1070 In the New Testament the word "liturgy" refers not only to the 
celebration of divine worship but also to the proclamation of the 
Gospel and to active charity.6 In all of these situations it is a question 
of the service of God and neighbor.  

In a liturgical celebration the Church is servant in the image of her 
Lord, the one "leitourgos";7 she shares in Christ's priesthood 
(worship), which is both prophetic (proclamation) and kingly (service 
of charity): 

The liturgy then is rightly seen as an exercise of the priestly office of 
Jesus Christ.  



It involves the presentation of man's sanctification under the guise of 
signs perceptible by the senses and its accomplishment in ways 
appropriate to each of these signs.  

In it full public worship is performed by the Mystical Body of Jesus 
Christ, that is, by the Head and his members.  

From this it follows that every liturgical celebration, because it is an 
action of Christ the priest and of his Body which is the Church, is a 
sacred action surpassing all others.  

No other action of the Church can equal its efficacy by the same title 
and to the same degree.8 

Liturgy as source of life 

1071 As the work of Christ liturgy is also an action of his Church. It 
makes the Church present and manifests her as the visible sign of the 
communion in Christ between God and men. It engages the faithful in 
the new life of the community and involves the "conscious, active, and 
fruitful participation" of everyone.9 

1072 "The sacred liturgy does not exhaust the entire activity of the 
Church":10 it must be preceded by evangelization, faith, and 
conversion. It can then produce its fruits in the lives of the faithful: 
new life in the Spirit, involvement in the mission of the Church, and 
service to her unity. 

Prayer and liturgy 

1073 The liturgy is also a participation in Christ's own prayer 
addressed to the Father in the Holy Spirit. In the liturgy, all Christian 
prayer finds its source and goal. Through the liturgy the inner man is 
rooted and grounded in "the great love with which [the Father] loved 
us" in his beloved Son.11 It is the same "marvelous work of God" that 
is lived and internalized by all prayer, "at all times in the Spirit."12 

Catechesis and liturgy 

1074 "The liturgy is the summit toward which the activity of the 
Church is directed; it is also the font from which all her power 
flows."13  

It is therefore the privileged place for catechizing the People of God.  



"Catechesis is intrinsically linked with the whole of liturgical and 
sacramental activity, for it is in the sacraments, especially in the 
Eucharist, that Christ Jesus works in fullness for the transformation of 
men."14 

1075 Liturgical catechesis aims to initiate people into the mystery of 
Christ (It is "mystagogy." ) by proceeding from the visible to the 
invisible, from the sign to the thing signified, from the "sacraments" to 
the "mysteries."  

Such catechesis is to be presented by local and regional catechisms.  

This Catechism, which aims to serve the whole Church in all the 
diversity of her rites and cultures,15 will present what is fundamental 
and common to the whole Church in the liturgy as mystery and as 
celebration, and then the seven sacraments and the sacramentals.

PART TWO: THE CELEBRATION OF THE CHRISTIAN 
MYSTERY 

 

 

SECTION ONE THE SACRAMENTAL ECONOMY 

1076 The Church was made manifest to the world on the day of 
Pentecost by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.1 The gift of the Spirit 
ushers in a new era in the "dispensation of the mystery" the age of the 
Church, during which Christ manifests, makes present, and 
communicates his work of salvation 

through the liturgy of his Church, "until he comes."2 In this age of the 
Church Christ now lives and acts in and with his Church, in a new way 
appropriate to this new age. He acts through the sacraments in what 



the common Tradition of the East and the West calls "the sacramental 
economy"; this is the communication (or "dispensation") of the fruits 
of Christ's Paschal mystery in the celebration of the Church's 
"sacramental" liturgy. 

It is therefore important first to explain this "sacramental dispensation" 
(chapter one). the nature and essential features of liturgical celebration 
will then appear more clearly (chapter two).

Article 1 THE LITURGY - WORK OF THE HOLY TRINITY 

I. The Father-Source and Goal of the Liturgy 

1077 "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who 
has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly 
places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, 
that we should be holy and blameless before him. He destined us 
before him in love to be his sons through Jesus Christ, according to the 
purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace which he freely 
bestowed on us in the Beloved."3 

1078 Blessing is a divine and life-giving action, the source of which is 
the Father; his blessing is both word and gift.4 When applied to man, 
the word "blessing" means adoration and surrender to his Creator in 
thanksgiving. 

1079 From the beginning until the end of time the whole of God's 
work is a blessing. From the liturgical poem of the first creation to the 
canticles of the heavenly Jerusalem, the inspired authors proclaim the 
plan of salvation as one vast divine blessing. 

1080 From the very beginning God blessed all living beings, especially 
man and woman. the covenant with Noah and with all living things 
renewed this blessing of fruitfulness despite man's sin which had 
brought a curse on the ground. But with Abraham, the divine blessing 
entered into human history which was moving toward death, to 
redirect it toward life, toward its source. By the faith of "the father of 
all believers," who embraced the blessing, the history of salvation is 
inaugurated. 

1081 The divine blessings were made manifest in astonishing and 
saving events: the birth of Isaac, the escape from Egypt (Passover and 



Exodus), the gift of the promised land, the election of David, the 
presence of God in the Temple, the purifying exile, and return of a 
"small remnant." the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms, interwoven in 
the liturgy of the Chosen People, recall these divine blessings and at 
the same time respond to them with blessings of praise and 
thanksgiving. 

1082 In the Church's liturgy the divine blessing is fully revealed and 
communicated. the Father is acknowledged and adored as the source 
and the end of all the blessings of creation and salvation. In his Word 
who became incarnate, died, and rose for us, he fills us with his 
blessings. Through his Word, he pours into our hearts the Gift that 
contains all gifts, the Holy Spirit. 

1083 The dual dimension of the Christian liturgy as a response of faith 
and love to the spiritual blessings the Father bestows on us is thus 
evident. On the one hand, the Church, united with her Lord and "in 
the Holy Spirit,"5 blesses the Father "for his inexpressible gift6 in her 
adoration, praise, and thanksgiving. On the other hand, until the 
consummation of God's plan, the Church never ceases to present to 
the Father the offering of his own gifts and to beg him to send the 
Holy Spirit upon that offering, upon herself, upon the faithful, and 
upon the whole world, so that through communion in the death and 
resurrection of Christ the Priest, and by the power of the Spirit, these 
divine blessings will bring forth the fruits of life "to the praise of his 
glorious grace."7

II. Christ's Work in the Liturgy 

Christ glorified . . . 

1084 "Seated at the right hand of the Father" and pouring out the 
Holy Spirit on his Body which is the Church, Christ now acts through 
the sacraments he instituted to communicate his grace. the sacraments 
are perceptible signs (words and actions) accessible to our human 
nature. By the action of Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit they 
make present efficaciously the grace that they signify. 

1085 In the liturgy of the Church, it is principally his own Paschal 
mystery that Christ signifies and makes present. During his earthly life 
Jesus announced his Paschal mystery by his teaching and anticipated it 
by his actions. When his Hour comes, he lives out the unique event of 
history which does not pass away: Jesus dies, is buried, rises from the 
dead, and is seated at the right hand of the Father "once for all."8 His 
Paschal mystery is a real event that occurred in our history, but it is 
unique: all other historical events happen once, and then they pass 
away, swallowed up in the past. the Paschal mystery of Christ, by 
contrast, cannot remain only in the past, because by his death he 
destroyed death, and all that Christ is - all that he did and suffered for 
all men - participates in the divine eternity, and so transcends all times 
while being made present in them all. the event of the Cross and 
Resurrection abides and draws everything toward life. 

. . . from the time of the Church of the Apostles . . . 



1086 "Accordingly, just as Christ was sent by the Father so also he sent 
the apostles, filled with the Holy Spirit. This he did so that they might 
preach the Gospel to every creature and proclaim that the Son of God 
by his death and resurrection had freed us from the power of Satan 
and from death and brought us into the Kingdom of his Father. But he 
also willed that the work of salvation which they preached should be 
set in train through the sacrifice and sacraments, around which the 
entire liturgical life revolves."9 

1087 Thus the risen Christ, by giving the Holy Spirit to the apostles, 
entrusted to them his power of sanctifying:10 they became sacramental 
signs of Christ. By the power of the same Holy Spirit they entrusted 
this power to their successors. This 

"apostolic succession" structures the whole liturgical life of the Church 
and is itself sacramental, handed on by the sacrament of Holy Orders. 

. . . is present in the earthly liturgy . . . 

1088 "To accomplish so great a work" - the dispensation or 
communication of his work of salvation - "Christ is always present in 
his Church, especially in her liturgical celebrations. He is present in the 
Sacrifice of the Mass not only in the person of his minister, 'the same 
now offering, through the ministry of priests, who formerly offered 
himself on the cross,' but especially in the Eucharistic species. By his 
power he is present in the sacraments so that when anybody baptizes, it 
is really Christ himself who baptizes. He is present in his word since it 
is he himself who speaks when the holy Scriptures are read in the 
Church. Lastly, he is present when the Church prays and sings, for he 
has promised 'where two or three are gathered together in my name 
there am I in the midst of them."'11 

1089 "Christ, indeed, always associates the Church with himself in this 
great work in which God is perfectly glorified and men are sanctified. 
the Church is his beloved Bride who calls to her Lord and through him 
offers worship to the eternal Father."12 

. . . which participates in the liturgy of heaven 

1090 "In the earthly liturgy we share in a foretaste of that heavenly 
liturgy which is celebrated in the Holy City of Jerusalem toward which 



we journey as pilgrims, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God, 
Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle. With all the 
warriors of the heavenly army we sing a hymn of glory to the Lord; 
venerating the memory of the saints, we hope for some part and 
fellowship with them; we eagerly await the Savior, our Lord Jesus 
Christ, until he, our life, shall appear and we too will appear with him 
in glory."13

III. The Holy Spirit and the Church in the Liturgy 



1091 In the liturgy the Holy Spirit is teacher of the faith of the People 
of God and artisan of "God's masterpieces," the sacraments of the 
New Covenant. the desire and work of the Spirit in the heart of the 
Church is that we may live from the life of the risen Christ. When the 
Spirit encounters in us the response of faith which he has aroused in 
us, he brings about genuine cooperation. Through it, the liturgy 
becomes the common work of the Holy Spirit and the Church. 

1092 In this sacramental dispensation of Christ's mystery the Holy 
Spirit acts in the same way as at other times in the economy of 
salvation: he prepares the Church to encounter her Lord; he recalls 
and makes Christ manifest to the faith of the assembly. By his 
transforming power, he makes the mystery of Christ present here and 
now. Finally the Spirit of communion unites the Church to the life and 
mission of Christ.  

The Holy Spirit prepares for the reception of Christ 

1093 In the sacramental economy the Holy Spirit fulfills what was 
prefigured in the Old Covenant. Since Christ's Church was "prepared 
in marvellous fashion in the history of the people of Israel and in the 
Old Covenant,"14 The Church's liturgy has retained certain elements 
of the worship of the Old Covenant as integral and irreplaceable, 
adopting them as her own:  

-notably, reading the Old Testament;  

-praying the Psalms;  

-above all, recalling the saving events and significant realities which 
have found their fulfillment in the mystery of Christ (promise and 
covenant, Exodus and Passover, kingdom and temple, exile and 
return). 

1094 It is on this harmony of the two Testaments that the Paschal 
catechesis of the Lord is built,15 and then, that of the Apostles and the 
Fathers of the Church. This catechesis unveils what lay hidden under 
the letter of the Old Testament: the mystery of Christ. It is called 
"typological" because it reveals the newness of Christ on the basis of 
the "figures" (types) which announce him in the deeds, words, and 
symbols of the first covenant. By this re-reading in the Spirit of Truth, 



starting from Christ, the figures are unveiled.16 Thus the flood and 
Noah's ark prefigured salvation by Baptism,17 as did the cloud and the 
crossing of the Red Sea. Water from the rock was the figure of the 
spiritual gifts of Christ, and manna in the desert prefigured the 
Eucharist, "the true bread from heaven."18 

1095 For this reason the Church, especially during Advent and Lent 
and above all at the Easter Vigil, re-reads and re-lives the great events 
of salvation history in the "today" of her liturgy. But this also demands 
that catechesis help the faithful to open themselves to this spiritual 
understanding of the economy of salvation as the Church's liturgy 
reveals it and enables us to live it. 

1096 Jewish liturgy and Christian liturgy. A better knowledge of the 
Jewish people's faith and religious life as professed and lived even now 
can help our better understanding of certain aspects of Christian 
liturgy. For both Jews and Christians Sacred Scripture is an essential 
part of their respective liturgies: in the proclamation of the Word of 
God, the response to this word, prayer of praise and intercession for 
the living and the dead, invocation of God's mercy. In its characteristic 
structure the Liturgy of the Word originates in Jewish prayer. the 
Liturgy of the Hours and other liturgical texts and formularies, as well 
as those of our most venerable prayers, including the Lord's Prayer, 
have parallels in Jewish prayer. the Eucharistic Prayers also draw their 
inspiration from the Jewish tradition. the relationship between Jewish 
liturgy and Christian liturgy, but also their differences in content, are 
particularly evident in the great feasts of the liturgical year, such as 
Passover. Christians and Jews both celebrate the Passover. For Jews, it 
is the Passover of history, tending toward the future; for Christians, it is 
the Passover fulfilled in the death and Resurrection of Christ, though 
always in expectation of its definitive consummation. 

1097 In the liturgy of the New Covenant every liturgical action, 
especially the celebration of the Eucharist and the sacraments, is an 
encounter between Christ and the Church. the liturgical assembly 
derives its unity from the "communion of the Holy Spirit" who gathers 
the children of God into the one Body of Christ. This assembly 
transcends racial, cultural, social - indeed, all human affinities. 



1098 The assembly should prepare itself to encounter its Lord and to 
become "a people well disposed." the preparation of hearts is the joint 
work of the Holy Spirit and the assembly, especially of its ministers. the 
grace of the Holy Spirit seeks to awaken faith, conversion of heart, and 
adherence to the Father's will. These dispositions are the precondition 
both for the reception of other graces conferred in the celebration itself 
and the fruits of new life which the celebration is intended to produce 
afterward. 

The Holy Spirit recalls the mystery of Christ 

1099 The Spirit and the Church cooperate to manifest Christ and his 
work of salvation in the liturgy. Primarily in the Eucharist, and by 
analogy in the other sacraments, the liturgy is the memorial of the 
mystery of salvation. the Holy Spirit is the Church's living memory.19 

1100 The Word of God. the Holy Spirit first recalls the meaning of the 
salvation event to the liturgical assembly by giving life to the Word of 
God, which is proclaimed so that it may be received and lived: 

In the celebration of the liturgy, Sacred Scripture is extremely 
important. From it come the lessons that are read and explained in the 
homily and the psalms that are sung. It is from the Scriptures that the 
prayers, collects, and hymns draw their inspiration and their force, and 
that actions and signs derive their meaning.20 

1101 The Holy Spirit gives a spiritual understanding of the Word of 
God to those who read or hear it, according to the dispositions of their 
hearts. By means of the words, actions, and symbols that form the 
structure of a celebration, the Spirit puts both the faithful and the 
ministers into a living relationship with Christ, the Word and Image of 
the Father, so that they can live out the meaning of what they hear, 
contemplate, and do in the celebration. 

1102 "By the saving word of God, faith . . . is nourished in the hearts 
of believers. By this faith then the congregation of the faithful begins 
and grows."21 The proclamation does not stop with a teaching; it 
elicits the response of faith as consent and commitment, directed at the 
covenant between God and his people. Once again it is the Holy Spirit 
who gives the grace of faith, strengthens it and makes it grow in the 
community. the liturgical assembly is first of all a communion in faith. 



1103 Anamnesis. the liturgical celebration always refers to God's saving 
interventions in history. "The economy of Revelation is realized by 
deeds and words which are intrinsically bound up with each other.... 
(The) words for their part proclaim the works and bring to light the 
mystery they contain."22 In the Liturgy of the Word the Holy Spirit 
"recalls" to the assembly all that Christ has done for us. In keeping 
with the nature of liturgical actions and the ritual traditions of the 
churches, the celebration "makes a remembrance" of the marvelous 
works of God in an anamnesis which may be more or less developed. 
the Holy Spirit who thus awakens the memory of the Church then 
inspires thanksgiving and praise (doxology). 

The Holy Spirit makes present the mystery of Christ 

1104 Christian liturgy not only recalls the events that saved us but 
actualizes them, makes them present. the Paschal mystery of Christ is 
celebrated, not repeated. It is the celebrations that are repeated, and in 
each celebration there is an outpouring of the Holy Spirit that makes 
the unique mystery present. 

1105 The Epiclesis ("invocation upon") is the intercession in which the 
priest begs the Father to send the Holy Spirit, the Sanctifier, so that 
the offerings may become the body and blood of Christ and that the 
faithful by receiving them, may themselves become a living offering to 
God.23 

1106 Together with the anamnesis, the epiclesis is at the heart of each 
sacramental celebration, most especially of the Eucharist: 

You ask how the bread becomes the Body of Christ, and the wine . . . 
the Blood of Christ I shall tell you: the Holy Spirit comes upon them 
and accomplishes what surpasses every word and thought . . . Let it be 
enough for you to understand that it is by the Holy Spirit, just as it was 
of the Holy Virgin and by the Holy Spirit that the Lord, through and in 
himself, took flesh.24 

1107 The Holy Spirit's transforming power in the liturgy hastens the 
coming of the kingdom and the consummation of the mystery of 
salvation. While we wait in hope he causes us really to anticipate the 
fullness of communion with the Holy Trinity. Sent by the Father who 



hears the epiclesis of the Church, the Spirit gives life to those who 
accept him and is, even now, the "guarantee" of their inheritance.25 

The communion of the Holy Spirit 

1108 In every liturgical action the Holy Spirit is sent in order to bring 
us into communion with Christ and so to form his Body. the Holy 
Spirit is like the sap of the Father's vine which bears fruit on its 
branches.26 The most intimate cooperation of the Holy Spirit and the 
Church is achieved in the liturgy. the Spirit who is the Spirit of 
communion, abides indefectibly in the Church. For this reason the 
Church is the great sacrament of divine communion which gathers 
God's scattered children together. Communion with the Holy Trinity 
and fraternal communion are inseparably the fruit of the Spirit in the 
liturgy.27 

1109 The epiclesis is also a prayer for the full effect of the assembly's 
communion with the mystery of Christ. "The grace of the Lord Jesus 
Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit"28 
have to remain with us always and bear fruit beyond the Eucharistic 
celebration. the Church therefore asks the Father to send the Holy 
Spirit to make the lives of the faithful a living sacrifice to God by their 
spiritual transformation into the image of Christ, by concern for the 
Church's unity, and by taking part in her mission through the witness 
and service of charity.

Article 1 THE LITURGY - WORK OF THE HOLY TRINITY 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

1110 In the liturgy of the Church, God the Father is blessed and 
adored as the source of all the blessings of creation and salvation with 
which he has blessed us in his Son, in order to give us the Spirit of filial 
adoption. 

1111 Christ's work in the liturgy is sacramental: because his mystery of 
salvation is made present there by the power of his Holy Spirit; 
because his Body, which is the Church, is like a sacrament (sign and 
instrument) in which the Holy Spirit dispenses the mystery of 
salvation; and because through her liturgical actions the pilgrim 
Church already participates, as by a foretaste, in the heavenly liturgy. 

1112 The mission of the Holy Spirit in the liturgy of the Church is to 
prepare the assembly to encounter Christ; to recall and manifest Christ 
to the faith of the assembly; to make the saving work of Christ present 
and active by his transforming power; and to make the gift of 
communion bear fruit in the Church.

Article 2 THE PASCHAL MYSTERY IN THE CHURCH'S 
SACRAMENTS 

1113 The whole liturgical life of the Church revolves around the 
Eucharistic sacrifice and the sacraments.29 There are seven sacraments 
in the Church: Baptism, Confirmation or Chrismation, Eucharist, 
Penance, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, and Matrimony.30 This 
article will discuss what is common to the Church's seven sacraments

I. The Sacraments of Christ 

1114 "Adhering to the teaching of the Holy Scriptures, to the apostolic 
traditions, and to the consensus . . . of the Fathers," we profess that 
"the sacraments of the new law were . . . all instituted by Jesus Christ 
our Lord."31 

1115 Jesus' words and actions during his hidden life and public 
ministry were already salvific, for they anticipated the power of his 
Paschal mystery. They announced and prepared what he was going to 
give the Church when all was accomplished. the mysteries of Christ's 
life are the foundations of what he would henceforth dispense in the 
sacraments, through the ministers of his Church, for "what was visible 
in our Savior has passed over into his mysteries."32 

1116 Sacraments are "powers that comes forth" from the Body of 
Christ,33 which is ever-living and life-giving. They are actions of the 
Holy Spirit at work in his Body, the Church. They are "the 
masterworks of God" in the new and everlasting covenant.

II. The Sacraments of the Church 

1117 As she has done for the canon of Sacred Scripture and for the 
doctrine of the faith, the Church, by the power of the Spirit who guides 
her "into all truth," has gradually recognized this treasure received 
from Christ and, as the faithful steward of God's mysteries, has 
determined its "dispensation."34 Thus the Church has discerned over 
the centuries that among liturgical celebrations there are seven that 
are, in the strict sense of the term, sacraments instituted by the Lord. 

1118 The sacraments are "of the Church" in the double sense that they 
are "by her" and "for her." They are "by the Church," for she is the 
sacrament of Christ's action at work in her through the mission of the 
Holy Spirit. They are "for the Church" in the sense that "the 
sacraments make the Church,"35 since they manifest and 
communicate to men, above all in the Eucharist, the mystery of 
communion with the God who is love, One in three persons. 

1119 Forming "as it were, one mystical person" with Christ the head, 
the Church acts in the sacraments as "an organically structured priestly 
community."36 Through Baptism and Confirmation the pRiestly 
people is enabled to celebrate the liturgy, while those of the faithful 
"who have received Holy Orders, are appointed to nourish the Church 
with the word and grace of God in the name of Christ."37 

1120 The ordained ministry or ministerial priesthood is at the service 
of the baptismal priesthood.38 The ordained priesthood guarantees 
that it really is Christ who acts in the sacraments through the Holy 
Spirit for the Church. the saving mission entrusted by the Father to his 
incarnate Son was committed to the apostles and through them to 



their successors: they receive the Spirit of Jesus to act in his name and 
in his person.39 The ordained minister is the sacramental bond that 
ties the liturgical action to what the apostles said and did and, through 
them, to the words and actions of Christ, the source and foundation of 
the sacraments. 

1121 The three sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy 
Orders confer, in addition to grace, a sacramental character or "seal" 
by which the Christian shares in Christ's priesthood and is made a 
member of the Church according to different states and functions. This 
configuration to Christ and to the Church, brought about by the Spirit, 
is indelible,40 it remains for ever in the Christian as a positive 
disposition for grace, a promise and guarantee of divine protection, 
and as a vocation to divine worship and to the service of the Church. 
Therefore these sacraments can never be repeated.

III. The Sacraments of Faith 

1122 Christ sent his apostles so that "repentance and forgiveness of 
sins should be preached in his name to all nations."41 "Go therefore 
and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the 
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."42 The mission to 
baptize, and so the sacramental mission, is implied in the mission to 
evangelize, because the sacrament is prepared for by the word of God 
and by the faith which is assent to this word: 

The People of God is formed into one in the first place by the Word of 
the living God.... the preaching of the Word is required for the 
sacramental ministry itself, since the sacraments are sacraments of 
faith, drawing their origin and nourishment from the Word.43 

1123 "The purpose of the sacraments is to sanctify men, to build up 
the Body of Christ and, finally, to give worship to God. Because they 
are signs they also instruct. They not only presuppose faith, but by 
words and objects they also nourish, strengthen, and express it. That is 
why they are called 'sacraments of faith."'44 

1124 The Church's faith precedes the faith of the believer who is 
invited to adhere to it. When the Church celebrates the sacraments, she 
confesses the faith received from the apostles - whence the ancient 
saying: lex orandi, lex credendi (or: legem credendi lex statuat 
supplicandi according to Prosper of Aquitaine [5th cent.]).45 The law 
of prayer is the law of faith: the Church believes as she prays. Liturgy is 
a constitutive element of the holy and living Tradition.46 



1125 For this reason no sacramental rite may be modified or 
manipulated at the will of the minister or the community. Even the 
supreme authority in the Church may not change the liturgy 
arbitrarily, but only in the obedience of faith and with religious respect 
for the mystery of the liturgy. 

1126 Likewise, since the sacraments express and develop the 
communion of faith in the Church, the lex orandi is one of the 
essential criteria of the dialogue that seeks to restore the unity of 
Christians.47

IV. The Sacraments of Salvation 

1127 Celebrated worthily in faith, the sacraments confer the grace that 
they signify.48 They are efficacious because in them Christ himself is at 
work: it is he who baptizes, he who acts in his sacraments in order to 
communicate the grace that each sacrament signifies. the Father always 
hears the prayer of his Son's Church which, in the epiclesis of each 
sacrament, expresses her faith in the power of the Spirit. As fire 
transforms into itself everything it touches, so the Holy Spirit 
transforms into the divine life whatever is subjected to his power. 

1128 This is the meaning of the Church's affirmation49 that the 
sacraments act ex opere operato (literally: "by the very fact of the 
action's being performed"), i.e., by virtue of the saving work of Christ, 
accomplished once for all. It follows that "the sacrament is not wrought 
by the righteousness of either the celebrant or the recipient, but by the 
power of God."50 From the moment that a sacrament is celebrated in 
accordance with the intention of the Church, the power of Christ and 
his Spirit acts in and through it, independently of the personal holiness 
of the minister. Nevertheless, the fruits of the sacraments also depend 
on the disposition of the one who receives them. 

1129 The Church affirms that for believers the sacraments of the New 
Covenant are necessary for salvation.51 "Sacramental grace" is the 
grace of the Holy Spirit, given by Christ and proper to each sacrament. 
the Spirit heals and transforms those who receive him by conforming 
them to the Son of God. the fruit of the sacramental life is that the 
Spirit of adoption makes the faithful partakers in the divine nature52 
by uniting them in a living union with the only Son, the Savior.

V. The Sacraments of Eternal Life 

1130 The Church celebrates the mystery of her Lord "until he comes," 
when God will be "everything to everyone."53 Since the apostolic age 
the liturgy has been drawn toward its goal by the Spirit's groaning in 
the Church: Marana tha!54 The liturgy thus shares in Jesus' desire: "I 
have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you . . . until it is 
fulfilled in the kingdom of God."55 In the sacraments of Christ the 
Church already receives the guarantee of her inheritance and even now 
shares in everlasting life, while "awaiting our blessed hope, the 
appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Christ Jesus."56 
The "Spirit and the Bride say, 'Come . . . Come, Lord Jesus!"'57 

St. Thomas sums up the various aspects of sacramental signs: 
"Therefore a sacrament is a sign that commemorates what precedes it - 
Christ's Passion; demonstrates what is accomplished in us through 



Christ's Passion - grace; and prefigures what that Passion pledges to us 
- future glory."58

IN BRIEF 

1131 The sacraments are efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ 
and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us. 
the visible rites by which the sacraments are celebrated signify and 



make present the graces proper to each sacrament. They bear fruit in 
those who receive them with the required dispositions. 

1132 The Church celebrates the sacraments as a priestly community 
structured by the baptismal priesthood and the priesthood of ordained 
ministers. 

1133 The Holy Spirit prepares the faithful for the sacraments by the 
Word of God and the faith which welcomes that word in well-disposed 
hearts. Thus the sacraments strengthen faith and express it. 

1134 The fruit of sacramental life is both personal and ecclesial. For 
every one of the faithful an the one hand, this fruit is life for God in 
Christ Jesus; for the Church, on the other, it is an increase in charity 
and in her mission of witness.

CHAPTER TWO THE SACRAMENTAL CELEBRATION OF THE 
PASCHAL MYSTERY 

1135 The catechesis of the liturgy entails first of all an understanding 
of the sacramental economy (Chapter One). In this light, the 
innovation of its celebration is revealed. This chapter will therefore 
treat of the celebration of the sacraments of the Church. It will 
consider that which, through the diversity of liturgical traditions, is 
common to the celebration of the seven sacraments. What is proper to 
each will be treated later. This fundamental catechesis on the 
sacramental celebrations responds to the first questions posed by the 
faithful regarding this subject:  

- Who celebrates the liturgy?  

- How is the liturgy celebrated?  

- When is the liturgy celebrated?  

- Where is the liturgy celebrated?

Article 1 CELEBRATING THE CHURCH'S LITURGY 

I. Who Celebrates? 

1136 Liturgy is an "action" of the whole Christ (Christus totus). Those 
who even now celebrate it without signs are already in the heavenly 
liturgy, where celebration is wholly communion and feast 

The celebrants of the heavenly liturgy 

1137 The book of Revelation of St. John, read in the Church's liturgy, 
first reveals to us, "A throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the 
throne": "the Lord God."1 It then shows the Lamb, "standing, as 
though it had been slain": Christ crucified and risen, the one high 
priest of the true sanctuary, the same one "who offers and is offered, 
who gives and is given."2 Finally it presents "the river of the water of 
life . . . flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb," one of most 
beautiful symbols of the Holy Spirit.3 

1138 "Recapitulated in Christ," these are the ones who take part in the 
service of the praise of God and the fulfillment of his plan: the 
heavenly powers, all creation (the four living beings), the servants of 
the Old and New Covenants (the twenty-four elders), the new People 
of God (the one hundred and forty-four thousand),4 especially the 
martyrs "slain for the word of God," and the all-holy Mother of God 
(the Woman), the Bride of the Lamb,5 and finally "a great multitude 



which no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes, and 
peoples and tongues."6 

1139 It is in this eternal liturgy that the Spirit and the Church enable 
us to participate whenever we celebrate the mystery of salvation in the 
sacraments. 

The celebrants of the sacramental liturgy 

1140 It is the whole community, the Body of Christ united with its 
Head, that celebrates. "Liturgical services are not private functions but 
are celebrations of the Church which is 'the sacrament of unity,' 
namely, the holy people united and organized under the authority of 
the bishops. Therefore, liturgical services pertain to the whole Body of 
the Church. They manifest it, and have effects upon it. But they touch 
individual members of the Church in different ways, depending on 
their orders, their role in the liturgical services, and their actual 
participation in them."7 For this reason, "rites which are meant to be 
celebrated in common, with the faithful present and actively 
participating, should as far as possible be celebrated in that way rather 
than by an individual and quasi-privately."8 

1141 The celebrating assembly is the community of the baptized who, 
"by regeneration and the anointing of the Holy Spirit, are consecrated 
to be a spiritual house and a holy priesthood, that through all the 
works of Christian men they may offer spiritual sacrifices."9 This 
"common priesthood" is that of Christ the sole priest, in which all his 
members participate:10 

Mother Church earnestly desires that all the faithful should be led to 
that full, conscious, and active participation in liturgical celebrations 
which is demanded by the very nature of the liturgy, and to which the 
Christian people, "a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a 
redeemed people," have a right and an obligation by reason of their 
Baptism.11 

1142 But "the members do not all have the same function."12 Certain 
members are called by God, in and through the Church, to a special 
service of the community. These servants are chosen and consecrated 
by the sacrament of Holy Orders, by which the Holy Spirit enables 
them to act in the person of Christ the head, for the service of all the 



members of the Church.13 The ordained minister is, as it were, an 
"icon" of Christ the priest. Since it is in the Eucharist that the 
sacrament of the Church is made fully visible, it is in his presiding at 
the Eucharist that the bishop's ministry is most evident, as well as, in 
communion with him, the ministry of priests and deacons. 

1143 For the purpose of assisting the work of the common priesthood 
of the faithful, other particular ministries also exist, not consecrated by 
the sacrament of Holy Orders; their functions are determined by the 
bishops, in accord with liturgical traditions and pastoral needs. 
"Servers, readers, commentators, and members of the choir also 
exercise a genuine liturgical function."14 

1144 In the celebration of the sacraments it is thus the whole assembly 
that is leitourgos, each according to his function, but in the "unity of 
the Spirit" who acts in all. "In liturgical celebrations each person, 
minister or layman, who has an office to perform, should carry out all 
and only those parts which pertain to his office by the nature of the rite 
and the norms of the liturgy."15

Article 1 CELEBRATING THE CHURCH'S LITURGY 

 

 

II. How is the Liturgy Celebrated? 

Signs and symbols 

1145 A sacramental celebration is woven from signs and symbols. In 
keeping with the divine pedagogy of salvation, their meaning is rooted 
in the work of creation and in human culture, specified by the events of 
the Old Covenant and fully revealed in the person and work of Christ. 

1146 Signs of the human world. In human life, signs and symbols 
occupy an important place. As a being at once body and spirit, man 
expresses and perceives spiritual realities through physical signs and 
symbols. As a social being, man needs signs and symbols to 
communicate with others, through language, gestures, and actions. the 
same holds true for his relationship with God. 

1147 God speaks to man through the visible creation. the material 
cosmos is so presented to man's intelligence that he can read there 
traces of its Creator.16 Light and darkness, wind and fire, water and 
earth, the tree and its fruit speak of God and symbolize both his 
greatness and his nearness. 

1148 Inasmuch as they are creatures, these perceptible realities can 
become means of expressing the action of God who sanctifies men, 
and the action of men who offer worship to God. the same is true of 
signs and symbols taken from the social life of man: washing and 
anointing, breaking bread and sharing the cup can express the 
sanctifying presence of God and man's gratitude toward his Creator. 



1149 The great religions of mankind witness, often impressively, to this 
cosmic and symbolic meaning of religious rites. the liturgy of the 
Church presupposes, integrates and sanctifies elements from creation 
and human culture, conferring on them the dignity of signs of grace, of 
the new creation in Jesus Christ. 

1150 Signs of the covenant. the Chosen People received from God 
distinctive signs and symbols that marked its liturgical life. These are 
no longer solely celebrations of cosmic cycles and social gestures, but 
signs of the covenant, symbols of God's mighty deeds for his people. 
Among these liturgical signs from the Old Covenant are circumcision, 
anointing and consecration of kings and priests, laying on of hands, 
sacrifices, and above all the Passover. the Church sees in these signs a 
prefiguring of the sacraments of the New Covenant. 

1151 Signs taken up by Christ. In his preaching the Lord Jesus often 
makes use of the signs of creation to make known the mysteries of the 
Kingdom of God.17 He performs healings and illustrates his preaching 
with physical signs or symbolic gestures.18 He gives new meaning to 
the deeds and signs of the Old Covenant, above all to the Exodus and 
the Passover,19 for he himself is the meaning of all these signs. 

1152 Sacramental signs. Since Pentecost, it is through the sacramental 
signs of his Church that the Holy Spirit carries on the work of 
sanctification. the sacraments of the Church do not abolish but purify 
and integrate all the richness of the signs and symbols of the cosmos 
and of social life. Further, they fulfill the types and figures of the Old 
Covenant, signify and make actively present the salvation wrought by 
Christ, and prefigure and anticipate the glory of heaven. Words and 
actions 

1153 A sacramental celebration is a meeting of God's children with 
their Father, in Christ and the Holy Spirit; this meeting takes the form 
of a dialogue, through actions and words. Admittedly, the symbolic 
actions are already a language, but the Word of God and the response 
of faith have to accompany and give life to them, so that the seed of the 
Kingdom can bear its fruit in good soil. the liturgical actions signify 
what the Word of God expresses: both his free initiative and his 
people's response of faith. 



1154 The liturgy of the Word is an integral part of sacramental 
celebrations. To nourish the faith of believers, the signs which 
accompany the Word of God should be emphasized: the book of the 
Word (a lectionary or a book of the Gospels), its veneration 
(procession, incense, candles), the place of its proclamation (lectern or 
ambo), its audible and intelligible reading, the minister's homily which 
extends its proclamation, and the responses of the assembly 
(acclamations, meditation psalms, litanies, and profession of faith). 

1155 The liturgical word and action are inseparable both insofar as 
they are signs and instruction and insofar as they accomplish what they 
signify. When the Holy Spirit awakens faith, he not only gives an 
understanding of the Word of God, but through the sacraments also 
makes present the "wonders" of God which it proclaims. the Spirit 
makes present and communicates the Father's work, fulfilled by the 
beloved Son. 

Singing and music 

1156 "The musical tradition of the universal Church is a treasure of 
inestimable value, greater even than that of any other art. the main 
reason for this pre-eminence is that, as a combination of sacred music 
and words, it forms a necessary or integral part of solemn liturgy."20 
The composition and singing of inspired psalms, often accompanied 
by musical instruments, were already closely linked to the liturgical 
celebrations of the Old Covenant. the Church continues and develops 
this tradition: "Address . . . one another in psalms and hymns and 
spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with all your 
heart." "He who sings prays twice."21 

1157 Song and music fulfill their function as signs in a manner all the 
more significant when they are "more closely connected . . . with the 
liturgical action,"22 according to three principal criteria: beauty 
expressive of prayer, the unanimous participation of the assembly at 
the designated moments, and the solemn character of the celebration. 
In this way they participate in the purpose of the liturgical words and 
actions: the glory of God and the sanctification of the faithful:23 

How I wept, deeply moved by your hymns, songs, and the voices that 
echoed through your Church! What emotion I experienced in them! 



Those sounds flowed into my ears distilling the truth in my heart. A 
feeling of devotion surged within me, and tears streamed down my face 
- tears that did me good.24 

1158 The harmony of signs (song, music, words, and actions) is all the 
more expressive and fruitful when expressed in the cultural richness of 
the People of God who celebrate.25 Hence "religious singing by the 
faithful is to be intelligently fostered so that in devotions and sacred 
exercises as well as in liturgical services," in conformity with the 
Church's norms, "the voices of the faithful may be heard." But "the 
texts intended to be sung must always be in conformity with Catholic 
doctrine. Indeed they should be drawn chiefly from the Sacred 
Scripture and from liturgical sources."26 

Holy images 

1159 The sacred image, the liturgical icon, principally represents 
Christ. It cannot represent the invisible and incomprehensible God, 
but the incarnation of the Son of God has ushered in a new "economy" 
of images: 

Previously God, who has neither a body nor a face, absolutely could 
not be represented by an image. But now that he has made himself 
visible in the flesh and has lived with men, I can make an image of 
what I have seen of God . . . and contemplate the glory of the Lord, his 
face unveiled.27 

1160 Christian iconography expresses in images the same Gospel 
message that Scripture communicates by words. Image and word 
illuminate each other: 

We declare that we preserve intact all the written and unwritten 
traditions of the Church which have been entrusted to us. One of these 
traditions consists in the production of representational artwork, which 
accords with the history of the preaching of the Gospel. For it confirms 
that the incarnation of the Word of God was real and not imaginary, 
and to our benefit as well, for realities that illustrate each other 
undoubtedly reflect each other's meaning.28 

1161 All the signs in the liturgical celebrations are related to Christ: as 
are sacred images of the holy Mother of God and of the saints as well. 



They truly signify Christ, who is glorified in them. They make manifest 
the "cloud of witnesses"29 who continue to participate in the salvation 
of the world and to whom we are united, above all in sacramental 
celebrations. Through their icons, it is man "in the image of God," 
finally transfigured "into his likeness,"30 who is revealed to our faith. 
So too are the angels, who also are recapitulated in Christ: 

Following the divinely inspired teaching of our holy Fathers and the 
tradition of the Catholic Church (for we know that this tradition comes 
from the Holy Spirit who dwells in her) we rightly define with full 
certainty and correctness that, like the figure of the precious and life-
giving cross, venerable and holy images of our Lord and God and 
Savior, Jesus Christ, our inviolate Lady, the holy Mother of God, and 
the venerated angels, all the saints and the just, whether painted or 
made of mosaic or another suitable material, are to be exhibited in the 
holy churches of God, on sacred vessels and vestments, walls and 
panels, in houses and on streets.31 

1162 "The beauty of the images moves me to contemplation, as a 
meadow delights the eyes and subtly infuses the soul with the glory of 
God."32 Similarly, the contemplation of sacred icons, united with 
meditation on the Word of God and the singing of liturgical hymns, 
enters into the harmony of the signs of celebration so that the mystery 
celebrated is imprinted in the heart's memory and is then expressed in 
the new life of the faithful.

Article 1 CELEBRATING THE CHURCH'S LITURGY 

 

 

III. When is the Liturgy Celebrated? 

Liturgical seasons 

1163 "Holy Mother Church believes that she should celebrate the 
saving work of her divine Spouse in a sacred commemoration on 
certain days throughout the course of the year. Once each week, on the 
day which she has called the Lord's Day, she keeps the memory of the 
Lord's resurrection. She also celebrates it once every year, together 
with his blessed Passion, at Easter, that most solemn of all feasts. In the 
course of the year, moreover, she unfolds the whole mystery of Christ 
.... Thus recalling the mysteries of the redemption, she opens up to the 
faithful the riches of her Lord's powers and merits, so that these are in 



some way made present in every age; the faithful lay hold of them and 
are filled with saving grace."33 

1164 From the time of the Mosaic law, the People of God have 
observed fixed feasts, beginning with Passover, to commemorate the 
astonishing actions of the Savior God, to give him thanks for them, to 
perpetuate their remembrance, and to teach new generations to 
conform their conduct to them. In the age of the Church, between the 
Passover of Christ already accomplished once for all, and its 
consummation in the kingdom of God, the liturgy celebrated on fixed 
days bears the imprint of the newness of the mystery of Christ. 

1165 When the Church celebrates the mystery of Christ, there is a 
word that marks her prayer: "Today!" - a word echoing the prayer her 
Lord taught her and the call of the Holy Spirit.34 This "today" of the 
living God which man is called to enter is "the hour" of Jesus' Passover, 
which reaches across and underlies all history: 

Life extends over all beings and fills them with unlimited light; the 
Orient of orients pervades the universe, and he who was "before the 
daystar" and before the heavenly bodies, immortal and vast, the great 
Christ, shines over all beings more brightly than the sun. Therefore a 
day of long, eternal light is ushered in for us who believe in him, a day 
which is never blotted out: the mystical Passover.35 

The Lord's day 

1166 "By a tradition handed down from the apostles which took its 
origin from the very day of Christ's Resurrection, the Church 
celebrates the Paschal mystery every seventh day, which day is 
appropriately called the Lord's Day or Sunday."36 The day of Christ's 
Resurrection is both the first day of the week, the memorial of the first 
day of creation, and the "eighth day," on which Christ after his "rest" 
on the great sabbath inaugurates the "day that the Lord has made," the 
"day that knows no evening."37 The Lord's Supper is its center, for 
there the whole community of the faithful encounters the risen Lord 
who invites them to his banquet:38 

The Lord's day, the day of Resurrection, the day of Christians, is our 
day. It is called the Lord's day because on it the Lord rose victorious to 
the Father. If pagans call it the "day of the sun," we willingly agree, for 



today the light of the world is raised, today is revealed the sun of justice 
with healing in his rays.39 

1167 Sunday is the pre-eminent day for the liturgical assembly, when 
the faithful gather "to listen to the word of God and take part in the 
Eucharist, thus calling to mind the Passion, Resurrection, and glory of 
the Lord Jesus, and giving thanks to God who 'has begotten them 
again, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead' unto a living 
hope":40 

When we ponder, O Christ, the marvels accomplished on this day, the 
Sunday of your holy resurrection, we say: "Blessed is Sunday, for on it 
began creation . . . the world's salvation ... the renewal of the human 
race .... On Sunday heaven and earth rejoiced and the whole universe 
was filled with light. Blessed is Sunday, for on it were opened the gates 
of paradise so that Adam and all the exiles might enter it without 
fear.41 

The liturgical year 

1168 Beginning with the Easter Triduum as its source of light, the new 
age of the Resurrection fills the whole liturgical year with its brilliance. 
Gradually, on either side of this source, the year is transfigured by the 
liturgy. It really is a "year of the Lord's favor."42 The economy of 
salvation is at work within the framework of time, but since its 
fulfillment in the Passover of Jesus and the outpouring of the Holy 
Spirit, the culmination of history is anticipated "as a foretaste," and the 
kingdom of God enters into our time. 

1169 Therefore Easter is not simply one feast among others, but the 
"Feast of feasts," the "Solemnity of solemnities," just as the Eucharist is 
the "Sacrament of sacraments" (the Great Sacrament). St. Athanasius 
calls Easter "the Great Sunday"43 and the Eastern Churches call Holy 
Week "the Great Week." the mystery of the Resurrection, in which 
Christ crushed death, permeates with its powerful energy our old time, 
until all is subjected to him. 

1170 At the Council of Nicaea in 325, all the Churches agreed that 
Easter, the Christian Passover, should be celebrated on the Sunday 
following the first full moon (14 Nisan) after the vernal equinox. 
Because of different methods of calculating the 14th day of the month 



of Nisan, the date of Easter in the Western and Eastern Churches is 
not always the same. For this reason, the Churches are seeking an 
agreement in order once again to celebrate the day of the Lord's 
Resurrection on a common date. 

1171 In the liturgical year the various aspects of the one Paschal 
mystery unfold. This is also the case with the cycle of feasts 
surrounding the mystery of the incarnation (Annunciation, Christmas, 
Epiphany). They commemorate the beginning of our salvation and 
communicate to us the first fruits of the Paschal mystery. 

The sanctoral in the liturgical year 

1172 "In celebrating this annual cycle of the mysteries of Christ, Holy 
Church honors the Blessed Mary, Mother of God, with a special love. 
She is inseparably linked with the saving work of her Son. In her the 
Church admires and exalts the most excellent fruit of redemption and 
joyfully contemplates, as in a faultless image, that which she herself 
desires and hopes wholly to be."44 

1173 When the Church keeps the memorials of martyrs and other 
saints during the annual cycle, she proclaims the Paschal mystery in 
those "who have suffered and have been glorified with Christ. She 
proposes them to the faithful as examples who draw all men to the 
Father through Christ, and through their merits she begs for God's 
favors."45 

The Liturgy of the Hours 

1174 The mystery of Christ, his Incarnation and Passover, which we 
celebrate in the Eucharist especially at the Sunday assembly, permeates 
and transfigures the time of each day, through the celebration of the 
Liturgy of the Hours, "the divine office."46 This celebration, faithful to 
the apostolic exhortations to "pray constantly," is "so devised that the 
whole course of the day and night is made holy by the praise of 
God."47 In this "public prayer of the Church,"48 The faithful (clergy, 
religious, and lay people) exercise the royal priesthood of the baptized. 
Celebrated in "the form approved" by the Church, the Liturgy of the 
Hours "is truly the voice of the Bride herself addressed to her 
Bridegroom. It is the very prayer which Christ himself together with 
his Body addresses to the Father.49 



1175 The Liturgy of the Hours is intended to become the prayer of the 
whole People of God. In it Christ himself "continues his priestly work 
through his Church."50 His members participate according to their 
own place in the Church and the circumstances of their lives: priests 
devoted to the pastoral ministry, because they are called to remain 
diligent in prayer and the service of the word; religious, by the charism 
of their consecrated lives; all the faithful as much as possible: "Pastors 
of souls should see to it that the principal hours, especially Vespers, are 
celebrated in common in church on Sundays and on the more solemn 
feasts. the laity, too, are encouraged to recite the divine office, either 
with the priests, or among themselves, or even individually."51 

1176 The celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours demands not only 
harmonizing the voice with the praying heart, but also a deeper 
"understanding of the liturgy and of the Bible, especially of the 
Psalms."52 

1177 The hymns and litanies of the Liturgy of the Hours integrate the 
prayer of the psalms into the age of the Church, expressing the 
symbolism of the time of day, the liturgical season, or the feast being 
celebrated. Moreover, the reading from the Word of God at each Hour 
(with the subsequent responses or troparia) and readings from the 
Fathers and spiritual masters at certain Hours, reveal more deeply the 
meaning of the mystery being celebrated, assist in understanding the 
psalms, and prepare for silent prayer. the lectio divina, where the Word 
of God is so read and meditated that it becomes prayer, is thus rooted 
in the liturgical celebration. 

1178 The Liturgy of the Hours, which is like an extension of the 
Eucharistic celebration, does not exclude but rather in a 
complementary way calls forth the various devotions of the People of 
God, especially adoration and worship of the Blessed Sacrament.

IV. Where is the Liturgy Celebrated? 

1179 The worship "in Spirit and in truth"53 of the New Covenant is 
not tied exclusively to any one place. the whole earth is sacred and 
entrusted to the children of men. What matters above all is that, when 
the faithful assemble in the same place, they are the "living stones," 
gathered to be "built into a spiritual house."54 For the Body of the 
risen Christ is the spiritual temple from which the source of living 
water springs forth: incorporated into Christ by the Holy Spirit, "we 
are the temple of the living God."55 

1180 When the exercise of religious liberty is not thwarted,56 
Christians construct buildings for divine worship. These visible 
churches are not simply gathering places but signify and make visible 
the Church living in this place, the dwelling of God with men 
reconciled and united in Christ. 

1181 A church, "a house of prayer in which the Eucharist is celebrated 
and reserved, where the faithful assemble, and where is worshipped the 
presence of the Son of God our Savior, offered for us on the sacrificial 
altar for the help and consolation of the faithful - this house ought to 
be in good taste and a worthy place for prayer and sacred 
ceremonial."57 In this "house of God" the truth and the harmony of 
the signs that make it up should show Christ to be present and active 
in this place.58 

1182 The altar of the New Covenant is the Lord's Cross,59 from 
which the sacraments of the Paschal mystery flow. On the altar, which 
is the center of the church, the sacrifice of the Cross is made present 



under sacramental signs. the altar is also the table of the Lord, to 
which the People of God are invited.60 In certain Eastern liturgies, the 
altar is also the symbol of the tomb (Christ truly died and is truly 
risen). 

1183 The tabernacle is to be situated "in churches in a most worthy 
place with the greatest honor."61 The dignity, placing, and security of 
the Eucharistic tabernacle should foster adoration before the Lord 
really present in the Blessed Sacrament of the altar.62  

The sacred chrism (myron), used in anointings as the sacramental sign 
of the seal of the gift of the Holy Spirit, is traditionally reserved and 
venerated in a secure place in the sanctuary. the oil of catechumens 
and the oil of the sick may also be placed there. 

1184 The chair of the bishop (cathedra) or the priest "should express 
his office of presiding over the assembly and of directing prayer."63  

The lectern (ambo): "The dignity of the Word of God requires the 
church to have a suitable place for announcing his message so that the 
attention of the people may be easily directed to that place during the 
liturgy of the Word."64 

1185 The gathering of the People of God begins with Baptism; a 
church must have a place for the celebration of Baptism (baptistry) 
and for fostering remembrance of the baptismal promises (holy water 
font).  

The renewal of the baptismal life requires penance. A church, then, 
must lend itself to the expression of repentance and the reception of 
forgiveness, which requires an appropriate place to receive penitents.  

A church must also be a space that invites us to the recollection and 
silent prayer that extend and internalize the great prayer of the 
Eucharist. 

1186 Finally, the church has an eschatological significance. To enter 
into the house of God, we must cross a threshold, which symbolizes 
passing from the world wounded by sin to the world of the new Life to 
which all men are called. the visible church is a symbol of the Father's 
house toward which the People of God is journeying and where the 



Father "will wipe every tear from their eyes."65 Also for this reason, the 
Church is the house of all God's children, open and welcoming.

CHAPTER TWO THE SACRAMENTAL CELEBRATION OF THE 
PASCHAL MYSTERY 

 

 

 

Article 1 CELEBRATING THE CHURCH'S LITURGY 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

1187 The liturgy is the work of the whole Christ, head and body. Our 
high priest celebrates it unceasingly in the heavenly liturgy, with the 
holy Mother of God, the apostles, all the saints, and the multitude of 
those who have already entered the kingdom. 
 

1188 In a liturgical celebration, the whole assembly is leitourgos, each 
member according to his own function. the baptismal priesthood is 
that of the whole Body of Christ. But some of the faithful are ordained 
through the sacrament of Holy Orders to represent Christ as head of 
the Body. 



1189 The liturgical celebration involves signs and symbols relating to 
creation (candles, water, fire), human life (washing, anointing, 
breaking bread) and the history of salvation (the rites of the Passover). 
Integrated into the world of faith and taken up by the power of the 
Holy Spirit, these cosmic elements, human rituals, and gestures of 
remembrance of God become bearers of the saving and sanctifying 
action of Christ. 

1190 The Liturgy of the Word is an integral part of the celebration. the 
meaning of the celebration is expressed by the Word of God which is 
proclaimed and by the response of faith to it. 

1191 Song and music are closely connected with the liturgical action. 
the criteria for their proper use are the beauty expressive of prayer, the 
unanimous participation of the assembly, and the sacred character of 
the celebration. 

1192 Sacred images in our churches and homes are intended to 
awaken and nourish our faith in the mystery of Christ. Through the 
icon of Christ and his works of salvation, it is he whom we adore. 
Through sacred images of the holy Mother of God, of the angels and 
of the saints, we venerate the persons represented. 

1193 Sunday, the "Lord's Day," is the principal day for the celebration 
of the Eucharist because it is the day of the Resurrection. It is the pre-
eminent day of the liturgical assembly, the day of the Christian family, 
and the day of joy and rest from work. Sunday is "the foundation and 
kernel of the whole liturgical year" (SC 106). 

1194 The Church, "in the course of the year, . . . unfolds the whole 
mystery of Christ from his Incarnation and Nativity through his 
Ascension, to Pentecost and the expectation of the blessed hope of the 
coming of the Lord" (SC 102 # 2). 

1195 By keeping the memorials of the saints - first of all the holy 
Mother of God, then the apostles, the martyrs, and other saints - on 
fixed days of the liturgical year, the Church on earth shows that she is 
united with the liturgy of heaven. She gives glory to Christ for having 
accomplished his salvation in his glorified members; their example 
encourages her on her way to the Father. 



1196 The faithful who celebrate the Liturgy of the Hours are united to 
Christ our high priest, by the prayer of the Psalms, meditation on the 
Word of God, and canticles and blessings, in order to be joined with 
his unceasing and universal prayer that gives glory to the Father and 
implores the gift of the Holy Spirit on the whole world. 

1197 Christ is the true temple of God, "the place where his glory 
dwells"; by the grace of God, Christians also become the temples of the 
Holy Spirit, living stones out of which the Church is built. 

1198 In its earthly state the Church needs places where the 
community can gather together. Our visible churches, holy places, are 
images of the holy city, the heavenly Jerusalem, toward which we are 
making our way on pilgrimage. 

1199 It is in these churches that the Church celebrates public worship 
to the glory of the Holy Trinity, hears the word of God and sings his 
praise, lifts up her prayer, and offers the sacrifice of Christ 
sacramentally present in the midst of the assembly. These churches are 
also places of recollection and personal prayer.

Article 2 LITURGICAL DIVERSITY AND THE UNITY OF THE 
MYSTERY 

Liturgical traditions and the catholicity of the Church 

1200 From the first community of Jerusalem until the parousia, it is 
the same Paschal mystery that the Churches of God, faithful to the 
apostolic faith, celebrate in every place. the mystery celebrated in the 
liturgy is one, but the forms of its celebration are diverse. 

1201 The mystery of Christ is so unfathomably rich that it cannot be 
exhausted by its expression in any single liturgical tradition. the history 
of the blossoming and development of these rites witnesses to a 
remarkable complementarity. When the Churches lived their respective 
liturgical traditions in the communion of the faith and the sacraments 
of the faith, they enriched one another and grew in fidelity to Tradition 
and to the common mission of the whole Church.66 

1202 The diverse liturgical traditions have arisen by very reason of the 
Church's mission. Churches of the same geographical and cultural area 
came to celebrate the mystery of Christ through particular expressions 
characterized by the culture: in the tradition of the "deposit of faith,"67 
in liturgical symbolism, in the organization of fraternal communion, in 
the theological understanding of the mysteries, and in various forms of 
holiness. Through the liturgical life of a local church, Christ, the light 
and salvation of all peoples, is made manifest to the particular people 



and culture to which that Church is sent and in which she is rooted. 
the Church is catholic, capable of integrating into her unity, while 
purifying them, all the authentic riches of cultures.68 

1203 The liturgical traditions or rites presently in use in the Church 
are the Latin (principally the Roman rite, but also the rites of certain 
local churches, such as the Ambrosian rite, or those of certain religious 
orders) and the Byzantine, Alexandrian or Coptic, Syriac, Armenian, 
Maronite and Chaldean rites. In "faithful obedience to tradition, the 
sacred Council declares that Holy Mother Church holds all lawfully 
recognized rites to be of equal right and dignity, and that she wishes to 
preserve them in the future and to foster them in every way."69 

Liturgy and culture 

1204 The celebration of the liturgy, therefore, should correspond to the 
genius and culture of the different peoples.70 In order that the mystery 
of Christ be "made known to all the nations . . . to bring about the 
obedience of faith,"71 it must be proclaimed, celebrated, and lived in 
all cultures in such a way that they themselves are not abolished by it, 
but redeemed and fulfilled:72 It is with and through their own human 
culture, assumed and transfigured by Christ, that the multitude of 
God's children has access to the Father, in order to glorify him in the 
one Spirit. 

1205 "In the liturgy, above all that of the sacraments, there is an 
immutable part, a part that is divinely instituted and of which the 
Church is the guardian, and parts that can be changed, which the 
Church has the power and on occasion also the duty to adapt to the 
cultures of recently evangelized peoples."73 

1206 "Liturgical diversity can be a source of enrichment, but it can 
also provoke tensions, mutual misunderstandings, and even schisms. In 
this matter it is clear that diversity must not damage unity. It must 
express only fidelity to the common faith, to the sacramental signs that 
the Church has received from Christ, and to hierarchical communion. 
Cultural adaptation also requires a conversion of heart and even, where 
necessary, a breaking with ancestral customs incompatible with the 
Catholic faith."74

IN BRIEF 

1207 It is fitting that liturgical celebration tends to express itself in the 
culture of the people where the Church finds herself, though without 
being submissive to it. Moreover, the liturgy itself generates cultures 
and shapes them. 

1208 The diverse liturgical traditions or rites, legitimately recognized, 
manifest the catholicity of the Church, because they signify and 
communicate the same mystery of Christ. 

1209 The criterion that assures unity amid the diversity of liturgical 
traditions is fidelity to apostolic Tradition, i e., the communion in the 
faith and the sacraments received from the apostles, a communion that 
is both signified and guaranteed by apostolic succession.

SECTION TWO THE SEVEN SACRAMENTS OF THE CHURCH 

1210 Christ instituted the sacraments of the new law. There are seven: 
Baptism, Confirmation (or Chrismation), the Eucharist, Penance, the 
Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders and Matrimony. the seven 
sacraments touch all the stages and all the important moments of 
Christian life:1 they give birth and increase, healing and mission to the 
Christian's life of faith. There is thus a certain resemblance between 
the stages of natural life and the stages of the spiritual life. 

1211 Following this analogy, the first chapter will expound the three 
sacraments of Christian initiation; the second, the sacraments of 
healing; and the third, the sacraments at the service of communion and 
the mission of the faithful. This order, while not the only one possible, 
does allow one to see that the sacraments form an organic whole in 
which each particular sacrament has its own vital place. In this organic 
whole, the Eucharist occupies a unique place as the "Sacrament of 
sacraments": "all the other sacraments are ordered to it as to their 
end."2

1212 The sacraments of Christian initiation - Baptism, Confirmation, 
and the Eucharist - lay the foundations of every Christian life. "The 
sharing in the divine nature given to men through the grace of Christ 
bears a certain likeness to the origin, development, and nourishing of 
natural life. the faithful are born anew by Baptism, strengthened by the 
sacrament of Confirmation, and receive in the Eucharist the food of 
eternal life. By means of these sacraments of Christian initiation, they 
thus receive in increasing measure the treasures of the divine life and 
advance toward the perfection of charity."3

Article 1 THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM 

1213 Holy Baptism is the basis of the whole Christian life, the gateway 
to life in the Spirit (vitae spiritualis ianua),4 and the door which gives 
access to the other sacraments. Through Baptism we are freed from sin 
and reborn as sons of God; we become members of Christ, are 
incorporated into the Church and made sharers in her mission: 
"Baptism is the sacrament of regeneration through water in the 
word."5

I. What is This Sacrament Called? 

1214 This sacrament is called Baptism, after the central rite by which it 
is carried out: to baptize (Greek baptizein) means to "plunge" or 
"immerse"; the "plunge" into the water symbolizes the catechumen's 
burial into Christ's death, from which he rises up by resurrection with 
him, as "a new creature."6 

1215 This sacrament is also called "the washing of regeneration and 
renewal by the Holy Spirit," for it signifies and actually brings about 
the birth of water and the Spirit without which no one "can enter the 
kingdom of God."7 

1216 "This bath is called enlightenment, because those who receive 
this [catechetical] instruction are enlightened in their understanding  

. . . ."8 Having received in Baptism the Word, "the true light that 
enlightens every man," the person baptized has been "enlightened," he 
becomes a "son of light," indeed, he becomes "light" himself:9 

Baptism is God's most beautiful and magnificent gift....We call it gift, 
grace, anointing, enlightenment, garment of immortality, bath of 
rebirth, seal, and most precious gift. It is called gift because it is 
conferred on those who bring nothing of their own; grace since it is 
given even to the guilty; Baptism because sin is buried in the water; 
anointing for it is priestly and royal as are those who are anointed; 
enlightenment because it radiates light; clothing since it veils our 
shame; bath because it washes; and seal as it is our guard and the sign 
of God's Lordship.10

II. Baptism in the Economy of Salvation 

Prefigurations of Baptism in the Old Covenant 

1217 In the liturgy of the Easter Vigil, during the blessing of the 
baptismal water, the Church solemnly commemorates the great events 
in salvation history that already prefigured the mystery of Baptism: 

Father, you give us grace through sacramental signs which tell us of the 
wonders of your unseen power. 

  

In Baptism we use your gift of water, which you have made a rich 
symbol of the grace you give us in this sacrament.11 

1218 Since the beginning of the world, water, so humble and 
wonderful a creature, has been the source of life and fruitfulness. 
Sacred Scripture sees it as "oveshadowed" by the Spirit of God:12 

At the very dawn of creation 



your Spirit breathed on the waters, 

making them the wellspring of all holiness.13 

1219 The Church has seen in Noah's ark a prefiguring of salvation by 
Baptism, for by it "a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through 
water":14 

The waters of the great flood 

you made a sign of the waters of Baptism, 

that make an end of sin and a new beginning of goodness.15 

1220 If water springing up from the earth symbolizes life, the water of 
the sea is a symbol of death and so can represent the mystery of the 
cross. By this symbolism Baptism signifies communion with Christ's 
death. 

1221 But above all, the crossing of the Red Sea, literally the liberation 
of Israel from the slavery of Egypt, announces the liberation wrought 
by Baptism: 

You freed the children of Abraham from the slavery of Pharaoh, 

bringing them dry-shod through the waters of the Red Sea, 

to be an image of the people set free in Baptism.16 

1222 Finally, Baptism is prefigured in the crossing of the Jordan River 
by which the People of God received the gift of the land promised to 
Abraham's descendants, an image of eternal life. the promise of this 
blessed inheritance is fulfilled in the New Covenant. 

Christ's Baptism 

1223 All the Old Covenant prefigurations find their fulfillment in 
Christ Jesus. He begins his public life after having himself baptized by 
St. John the Baptist in the Jordan.17 After his resurrection Christ gives 
this mission to his apostles: "Go therefore and make disciples of all 
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and 
of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded 
you."18 



1224 Our Lord voluntarily submitted himself to the baptism of St. 
John, intended for sinners, in order to "fulfill all righteousness."19 
Jesus' gesture is a manifestation of his self-emptying.20 The Spirit who 
had hovered over the waters of the first creation descended then on the 
Christ as a prelude of the new creation, and the Father revealed Jesus 
as his "beloved Son."21 

1225 In his Passover Christ opened to all men the fountain of Baptism. 
He had already spoken of his Passion, which he was about to suffer in 
Jerusalem, as a "Baptism" with which he had to be baptized.22 The 
blood and water that flowed from the pierced side of the crucified Jesus 
are types of Baptism and the Eucharist, the sacraments of new life.23 
From then on, it is possible "to be born of water and the Spirit"24 in 
order to enter the Kingdom of God. 

See where you are baptized, see where Baptism comes from, if not 
from the cross of Christ, from his death. There is the whole mystery: he 
died for you. In him you are redeemed, in him you are saved.25 

Baptism in the Church 

1226 From the very day of Pentecost the Church has celebrated and 
administered holy Baptism. Indeed St. Peter declares to the crowd 
astounded by his preaching: "Repent, and be baptized every one of you 
in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you 
shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."26 The apostles and their 
collaborators offer Baptism to anyone who believed in Jesus: Jews, the 
God-fearing, pagans.27 Always, Baptism is seen as connected with 
faith: "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your 
household," St. Paul declared to his jailer in Philippi. and the narrative 
continues, the jailer "was baptized at once, with all his family."28 

1227 According to the Apostle Paul, the believer enters through 
Baptism into communion with Christ's death, is buried with him, and 
rises with him: 

Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ 
Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him 
by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead by 
the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.29 



The baptized have "put on Christ."30 Through the Holy Spirit, 
Baptism is a bath that purifies, justifies, and sanctifies.31 

1228 Hence Baptism is a bath of water in which the "imperishable 
seed" of the Word of God produces its life-giving effect.32 St. 
Augustine says of Baptism: "The word is brought to the material 
element, and it becomes a sacrament."33

III. How is the Sacrament of Baptism Celebrated? 



Christian Initiation 

1229 From the time of the apostles, becoming a Christian has been 
accomplished by a journey and initiation in several stages. This journey 
can be covered rapidly or slowly, but certain essential elements will 
always have to be present: proclamation of the Word, acceptance of the 
Gospel entailing conversion, profession of faith, Baptism itself, the 
outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and admission to Eucharistic 
communion. 

1230 This initiation has varied greatly through the centuries according 
to circumstances. In the first centuries of the Church, Christian 
initiation saw considerable development. A long period of 
catechumenate included a series of preparatory rites, which were 
liturgical landmarks along the path of catechumenal preparation and 
culminated in the celebration of the sacraments of Christian initiation. 

1231 Where infant Baptism has become the form in which this 
sacrament is usually celebrated, it has become a single act 
encapsulating the preparatory stages of Christian initiation in a very 
abridged way. By its very nature infant Baptism requires a post-
baptismal catechumenate. Not only is there a need for instruction after 
Baptism, but also for the necessary flowering of baptismal grace in 
personal growth. the catechism has its proper place here. 

1232 The second Vatican Council restored for the Latin Church "the 
catechumenate for adults, comprising several distinct steps."34 The 
rites for these stages are to be found in the Rite of Christian Initiation 
of Adults (RCIA).35 The Council also gives permission that: "In 
mission countries, in addition to what is furnished by the Christian 
tradition, those elements of initiation rites may be admitted which are 
already in use among some peoples insofar as they can be adapted to 
the Christian ritual."36 

1233 Today in all the rites, Latin and Eastern, the Christian initiation 
of adults begins with their entry into the catechumenate and reaches 
its culmination in a single celebration of the three sacraments of 
initiation: Baptism, Confirmation, and the Eucharist.37 In the Eastern 
rites the Christian initiation of infants also begins with Baptism 
followed immediately by Confirmation and the Eucharist, while in the 



Roman rite it is followed by years of catechesis before being completed 
later by Confirmation and the Eucharist, the summit of their Christian 
initiation.38 

The mystagogy of the celebration 

1234 The meaning and grace of the sacrament of Baptism are clearly 
seen in the rites of its celebration. By following the gestures and words 
of this celebration with attentive participation, the faithful are initiated 
into the riches this sacrament signifies and actually brings about in 
each newly baptized person. 

1235 The sign of the cross, on the threshold of the celebration, marks 
with the imprint of Christ the one who is going to belong to him and 
signifies the grace of the redemption Christ won for us by his cross. 

1236 The proclamation of the Word of God enlightens the candidates 
and the assembly with the revealed truth and elicits the response of 
faith, which is inseparable from Baptism. Indeed Baptism is "the 
sacrament of faith" in a particular way, since it is the sacramental entry 
into the life of faith. 

1237 Since Baptism signifies liberation from sin and from its instigator 
the devil, one or more exorcisms are pronounced over the candidate. 
the celebrant then anoints him with the oil of catechumens, or lays his 
hands on him, and he explicitly renounces Satan. Thus prepared, he is 
able to confess the faith of the Church, to which he will be "entrusted" 
by Baptism.39 

1238 The baptismal water is consecrated by a prayer of epiclesis (either 
at this moment or at the Easter Vigil). the Church asks God that 
through his Son the power of the Holy Spirit may be sent upon the 
water, so that those who will be baptized in it may be "born of water 
and the Spirit."40 

1239 The essential rite of the sacrament follows: Baptism properly 
speaking. It signifies and actually brings about death to sin and entry 
into the life of the Most Holy Trinity through configuration to the 
Paschal mystery of Christ. Baptism is performed in the most expressive 
way by triple immersion in the baptismal water. However, from ancient 



times it has also been able to be conferred by pouring the water three 
times over the candidate's head. 

1240 In the Latin Church this triple infusion is accompanied by the 
minister's words: "N., I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of 
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit." In the Eastern liturgies the 
catechumen turns toward the East and the priest says: "The servant of 
God, N., is baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of 
the Holy Spirit." At the invocation of each person of the Most Holy 
Trinity, the priest immerses the candidate in the water and raises him 
up again. 

1241 The anointing with sacred chrism, perfumed oil consecrated by 
the bishop, signifies the gift of the Holy Spirit to the newly baptized, 
who has become a Christian, that is, one "anointed" by the Holy Spirit, 
incorporated into Christ who is anointed priest, prophet, and king.41 

1242 In the liturgy of the Eastern Churches, the post-baptismal 
anointing is the sacrament of Chrismation (Confirmation). In the 
Roman liturgy the post-baptismal anointing announces a second 
anointing with sacred chrism to be conferred later by the bishop 
Confirmation, which will as it were "confirm" and complete the 
baptismal anointing. 

1243 The white garment symbolizes that the person baptized has "put 
on Christ,"42 has risen with Christ. the candle, lit from the Easter 
candle, signifies that Christ has enlightened the neophyte. In him the 
baptized are "the light of the world."43  

The newly baptized is now, in the only Son, a child of God entitled to 
say the prayer of the children of God: "Our Father." 

1244 First Holy Communion. Having become a child of God clothed 
with the wedding garment, the neophyte is admitted "to the marriage 
supper of the Lamb"44 and receives the food of the new life, the body 
and blood of Christ. the Eastern Churches maintain a lively awareness 
of the unity of Christian initiation by giving Holy Communion to all 
the newly baptized and confirmed, even little children, recalling the 
Lord's words: "Let the children come to me, do not hinder them."45 
The Latin Church, which reserves admission to Holy Communion to 
those who have attained the age of reason, expresses the orientation of 



Baptism to the Eucharist by having the newly baptized child brought 
to the altar for the praying of the Our Father. 

1245 The solemn blessing concludes the celebration of Baptism. At the 
Baptism of newborns the blessing of the mother occupies a special 
place.

be baptized."46 

The Baptism of adults 

1247 Since the beginning of the Church, adult Baptism is the common 
practice where the proclamation of the Gospel is still new. the 
catechumenate (preparation for Baptism) therefore occupies an 
important place. This initiation into Christian faith and life should 
dispose the catechumen to receive the gift of God in Baptism, 
Confirmation, and the Eucharist. 

1248 The catechumenate, or formation of catechumens, aims at 
bringing their conversion and faith to maturity, in response to the 



divine initiative and in union with an ecclesial community. the 
catechumenate is to be "a formation in the whole Christian life . . . 
during which the disciples will be joined to Christ their teacher. the 
catechumens should be properly initiated into the mystery of salvation 
and the practice of the evangelical virtues, and they should be 
introduced into the life of faith, liturgy, and charity of the People of 
God by successive sacred rites."47 

1249 Catechumens "are already joined to the Church, they are already 
of the household of Christ, and are quite frequently already living a life 
of faith, hope, and charity."48 "With love and solicitude mother 
Church already embraces them as her own."49 

The Baptism of infants 

1250 Born with a fallen human nature and tainted by original sin, 
children also have need of the new birth in Baptism to be freed from 
the power of darkness and brought into the realm of the freedom of the 
children of God, to which all men are called.50 The sheer 
gratuitousness of the grace of salvation is particularly manifest in infant 
Baptism. the Church and the parents would deny a child the priceless 
grace of becoming a child of God were they not to confer Baptism 
shortly after birth.51 

1251 Christian parents will recognize that this practice also accords 
with their role as nurturers of the life that God has entrusted to 
them.52 

1252 The practice of infant Baptism is an immemorial tradition of the 
Church. There is explicit testimony to this practice from the second 
century on, and it is quite possible that, from the beginning of the 
apostolic preaching, when whole "households" received baptism, 
infants may also have been baptized.53 

Faith and Baptism 

1253 Baptism is the sacrament of faith.54 But faith needs the 
community of believers. It is only within the faith of the Church that 
each of the faithful can believe. the faith required for Baptism is not a 
perfect and mature faith, but a beginning that is called to develop. the 



catechumen or the godparent is asked: "What do you ask of God's 
Church?" the response is: "Faith!" 

1254 For all the baptized, children or adults, faith must grow after 
Baptism. For this reason the Church celebrates each year at the Easter 
Vigil the renewal of baptismal promises. Preparation for Baptism leads 
only to the threshold of new life. Baptism is the source of that new life 
in Christ from which the entire Christian life springs forth. 

1255 For the grace of Baptism to unfold, the parents' help is 
important. So too is the role of the godfather and godmother, who 
must be firm believers, able and ready to help the newly baptized - 
child or adult on the road of Christian life.55 Their task is a truly 
ecclesial function (officium).56 The whole ecclesial community bears 
some responsibility for the development and safeguarding of the grace 
given at Baptism.

V. Who can Baptize? 

1256 The ordinary ministers of Baptism are the bishop and priest and, 
in the Latin Church, also the deacon.57 In case of necessity, anyone, 
even a not-baptized person, with the required intention, can 
baptize.57B , by using the Trinitarian baptismal formula. The intention 
required is to will to do what the Church does when she baptizes. The 



Church finds the reason for this possibility in the universal saving will 
of God and the necessity of Baptism for salvation.58

VI. The Necessity of Baptism 

1257 The Lord himself affirms that Baptism is necessary for 
salvation.59 He also commands his disciples to proclaim the Gospel to 
all nations and to baptize them.60 Baptism is necessary for salvation 
for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had 
the possibility of asking for this sacrament.61 The Church does not 
know of any means other than Baptism that assures entry into eternal 
beatitude; this is why she takes care not to neglect the mission she has 
received from the Lord to see that all who can be baptized are "reborn 
of water and the Spirit." God has bound salvation to the sacrament of 
Baptism, but he himself is not bound by his sacraments. 

1258 The Church has always held the firm conviction that those who 
suffer death for the sake of the faith without having received Baptism 
are baptized by their death for and with Christ. This Baptism of blood, 
like the desire for Baptism, brings about the fruits of Baptism without 
being a sacrament. 

1259 For catechumens who die before their Baptism, their explicit 
desire to receive it, together with repentance for their sins, and charity, 
assures them the salvation that they were not able to receive through 
the sacrament. 

1260 "Since Christ died for all, and since all men are in fact called to 
one and the same destiny, which is divine, we must hold that the Holy 



Spirit offers to all the possibility of being made partakers, in a way 
known to God, of the Paschal mystery."62 Every man who is ignorant 
of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does 
the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can be 
saved. It may be supposed that such persons would have desired 
Baptism explicitly if they had known its necessity. 

1261 As regards children who have died without Baptism, the Church 
can only entrust them to the mercy of God, as she does in her funeral 
rites for them. Indeed, the great mercy of God who desires that all men 
should be saved, and Jesus' tenderness toward children which caused 
him to say: "Let the children come to me, do not hinder them,"63 
allow us to hope that there is a way of salvation for children who have 
died without Baptism. All the more urgent is the Church's call not to 
prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy 
Baptism.

VII. The Grace of Baptism 

1262 The different effects of Baptism are signified by the perceptible 
elements of the sacramental rite. Immersion in water symbolizes not 
only death and purification, but also regeneration and renewal. Thus 
the two principal effects are purification from sins and new birth in the 
Holy Spirit.64 

For the forgiveness of sins . . . 

1263 By Baptism all sins are forgiven, original sin and all personal sins, 
as well as all punishment for sin.65 In those who have been reborn 
nothing remains that would impede their entry into the Kingdom of 
God, neither Adam's sin, nor personal sin, nor the consequences of sin, 
the gravest of which is separation from God. 

1264 Yet certain temporal consequences of sin remain in the baptized, 
such as suffering, illness, death, and such frailties inherent in life as 
weaknesses of character, and so on, as well as an inclination to sin that 
Tradition calls concupiscence, or metaphorically, "the tinder for sin" 
(fomes peccati); since concupiscence "is left for us to wrestle with, it 
cannot harm those who do not consent but manfully resist it by the 
grace of Jesus Christ."66 Indeed, "an athlete is not crowned unless he 
competes according to the rules."67 

"A new creature" 

1265 Baptism not only purifies from all sins, but also makes the 
neophyte "a new creature," an adopted son of God, who has become a 
"partaker of the divine nature,"68 member of Christ and coheir with 
him,69 and a temple of the Holy Spirit.70 

1266 The Most Holy Trinity gives the baptized sanctifying grace, the 
grace of justification:  

- enabling them to believe in God, to hope in him, and to love him 
through the theological virtues;  



- giving them the power to live and act under the prompting of the 
Holy Spirit through the gifts of the Holy Spirit;  

- allowing them to grow in goodness through the moral virtues.  

Thus the whole organism of the Christian's supernatural life has its 
roots in Baptism. 

Incorporated into the Church, the Body of Christ 

1267 Baptism makes us members of the Body of Christ: "Therefore . . 
. we are members one of another."71 Baptism incorporates us into the 
Church. From the baptismal fonts is born the one People of God of 
the New Covenant, which transcends all the natural or human limits of 
nations, cultures, races, and sexes: "For by one Spirit we were all 
baptized into one body."72 

1268 The baptized have become "living stones" to be "built into a 
spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood."73 By Baptism they share in 
the priesthood of Christ, in his prophetic and royal mission. They are 
"a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's own people, 
that [they] may declare the wonderful deeds of him who called [them] 
out of darkness into his marvelous light."74 Baptism gives a share in 
the common priesthood of all believers. 

1269 Having become a member of the Church, the person baptized 
belongs no longer to himself, but to him who died and rose for us.75 
From now on, he is called to be subject to others, to serve them in the 
communion of the Church, and to "obey and submit" to the Church's 
leaders,76 holding them in respect and affection.77 Just as Baptism is 
the source of responsibilities and duties, the baptized person also 
enjoys rights within the Church: to receive the sacraments, to be 
nourished with the Word of God and to be sustained by the other 
spiritual helps of the Church.78 

1270 "Reborn as sons of God, [the baptized] must profess before men 
the faith they have received from God through the Church" and 
participate in the apostolic and missionary activity of the People of 
God.79 

The sacramental bond of the unity of Christians 



1271 Baptism constitutes the foundation of communion among all 
Christians, including those who are not yet in full communion with the 
Catholic Church: "For men who believe in Christ and have been 
properly baptized are put in some, though imperfect, communion with 
the Catholic Church. Justified by faith in Baptism, [they] are 
incorporated into Christ; they therefore have a right to be called 
Christians, and with good reason are accepted as brothers by the 
children of the Catholic Church."80 "Baptism therefore constitutes the 
sacramental bond of unity existing among all who through it are 
reborn."81 

An indelible spiritual mark . . . 

1272 Incorporated into Christ by Baptism, the person baptized is 
configured to Christ. Baptism seals the Christian with the indelible 
spiritual mark (character) of his belonging to Christ. No sin can erase 
this mark, even if sin prevents Baptism from bearing the fruits of 
salvation.82 Given once for all, Baptism cannot be repeated. 

1273 Incorporated into the Church by Baptism, the faithful have 
received the sacramental character that consecrates them for Christian 
religious worship.83 The baptismal seal enables and commits 
Christians to serve God by a vital participation in the holy liturgy of 
the Church and to exercise their baptismal priesthood by the witness 
of holy lives and practical charity.84 

1274 The Holy Spirit has marked us with the seal of the Lord 
("Dominicus character") "for the day of redemption."85 "Baptism 
indeed is the seal of eternal life."86 The faithful Christian who has 
"kept the seal" until the end, remaining faithful to the demands of his 
Baptism, will be able to depart this life "marked with the sign of 
faith,"87 with his baptismal faith, in expectation of the blessed vision 
of God - the consummation of faith - and in the hope of resurrection.

INITIATION 

 

 

 

Article 1 THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

1275 Christian initiation is accomplished by three sacraments together: 
Baptism which is the beginning of new life; Confirmation which is its 
strengthening; and the Eucharist which nourishes the disciple with 
Christ's Body and Blood for his transformation in Christ. 

1276 "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in 
the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching 
them to observe all that I have commanded you" (Mt 28:19-20). 



1277 Baptism is birth into the new life in Christ. In accordance with 
the Lord's will, it is necessary for salvation, as is the Church herself, 
which we enter by Baptism. 

1278 The essential rite of Baptism consists in immersing the candidate 
in water or pouring water on his head, while pronouncing the 
invocation of the Most Holy Trinity: the Father, the Son, and the Holy 
Spirit. 

1279 The fruit of Baptism, or baptismal grace, is a rich reality that 
includes forgiveness of original sin and all personal sins, birth into the 
new life by which man becomes an adoptive son of the Father, a 
member of Christ and a temple of the Holy Spirit. By this very fact the 
person baptized is incorporated into the Church, the Body of Christ, 
and made a sharer in the priesthood of Christ. 

1280 Baptism imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual sign, the 
character, which consecrates the baptized person for Christian 
worship. Because of the character Baptism cannot be repeated (cf. DS 
1609 and DS 1624). 

1281 Those who die for the faith, those who are catechumens, and all 
those who, without knowing of the Church but acting under the 
inspiration of grace, seek God sincerely and strive to fulfill his will, can 
be saved if they have not been baptized (cf. LG 16). 

1282 Since the earliest times, Baptism has been administered to 
children, for it is a grace and a gift of God that does not presuppose 
any human merit; children are baptized in the faith of the Church. 
Entry into Christian life gives access to true freedom. 

1283 With respect to children who have died without Baptism, the 
liturgy of the Church invites us to trust in God's mercy and to pray for 
their salvation. 

1284 In case of necessity, any person can baptize provided that he have 
the intention of doing that which the Church does and provided that 
he pours water on the candidate's head while saying: "I baptize you in 
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."

Article 2 THE SACRAMENT OF CONFIRMATION 

1285 Baptism, the Eucharist, and the sacrament of Confirmation 
together constitute the "sacraments of Christian initiation," whose 
unity must be safeguarded. It must be explained to the faithful that the 
reception of the sacrament of Confirmation is necessary for the 
completion of baptismal grace.88 For "by the sacrament of 



Confirmation, [the baptized] are more perfectly bound to the Church 
and are enriched with a special strength of the Holy Spirit. Hence they 
are, as true witnesses of Christ, more strictly obliged to spread and 
defend the faith by word and deed."89

INITIATION 

 

 

 

Article 2 THE SACRAMENT OF CONFIRMATION 

 

 

I. Confirmation in the Economy of Salvation 

1286 In the Old Testament the prophets announced that the Spirit of 
the Lord would rest on the hoped-for Messiah for his saving 
mission.90 The descent of the Holy Spirit on Jesus at his baptism by 
John was the sign that this was he who was to come, the Messiah, the 
Son of God.91 He was conceived of the Holy Spirit; his whole life and 
his whole mission are carried out in total communion with the Holy 
Spirit whom the Father gives him "without measure."92 

1287 This fullness of the Spirit was not to remain uniquely the 
Messiah's, but was to be communicated to the whole messianic 
people.93 On several occasions Christ promised this outpouring of the 
Spirit,94 a promise which he fulfilled first on Easter Sunday and then 
more strikingly at Pentecost.95 Filled with the Holy Spirit the apostles 
began to proclaim "the mighty works of God," and Peter declared this 
outpouring of the Spirit to be the sign of the messianic age.96 Those 
who believed in the apostolic preaching and were baptized received the 
gift of the Holy Spirit in their turn.97 

1288 "From that time on the apostles, in fulfillment of Christ's will, 
imparted to the newly baptized by the laying on of hands the gift of the 
Spirit that completes the grace of Baptism. For this reason in the 
Letter to the Hebrews the doctrine concerning Baptism and the laying 



on of hands is listed among the first elements of Christian instruction. 
the imposition of hands is rightly recognized by the Catholic tradition 
as the origin of the sacrament of Confirmation, which in a certain way 
perpetuates the grace of Pentecost in the Church."98 

1289 Very early, the better to signify the gift of the Holy Spirit, an 
anointing with perfumed oil (chrism) was added to the laying on of 
hands. This anointing highlights the name "Christian," which means 
"anointed" and derives from that of Christ himself whom God 
"anointed with the Holy Spirit."99 This rite of anointing has continued 
ever since, in both East and West. For this reason the Eastern Churches 
call this sacrament Chrismation, anointing with chrism, or myron 
which means "chrism." In the West, Confirmation suggests that this 
sacrament both confirms Baptism and strengthens baptismal gracet. 

Two traditions: East and West 

1290 In the first centuries Confirmation generally comprised one 
single celebration with Baptism, forming with it a "double sacrament," 
according to the expression of St. Cyprian. Among other reasons, the 
multiplication of infant baptisms all through the year, the increase of 
rural parishes, and the growth of dioceses often prevented the bishop 
from being present at all baptismal celebrations. In the West the desire 
to reserve the completion of Baptism to the bishop caused the 
temporal separation of the two sacraments. the East has kept them 
united, so that Confirmation is conferred by the priest who baptizes. 
But he can do so only with the "myron" consecrated by a bishop.100 

1291 A custom of the Roman Church facilitated the development of 
the Western practice: a double anointing with sacred chrism after 
Baptism. the first anointing of the neophyte on coming out of the 
baptismal bath was performed by the priest; it was completed by a 
second anointing on the forehead of the newly baptized by the 
bishop.101 The first anointing with sacred chrism, by the priest, has 
remained attached to the baptismal rite; it signifies the participation of 
the one baptized in the prophetic, priestly, and kingly offices of Christ. 
If Baptism is conferred on an adult, there is only one post-baptismal 
anointing, that of Confirmation. 



1292 The practice of the Eastern Churches gives greater emphasis to 
the unity of Christian initiation. That of the Latin Church more clearly 
expresses the communion of the new Christian with the bishop as 
guarantor and servant of the unity, catholicity and apostolicity of his 
Church, and hence the connection with the apostolic origins of 
Christ's Church.

II. The Signs and the Rite of Confirmation 

1293 In treating the rite of Confirmation, it is fitting to consider the 
sign of anointing and what it signifies and imprints: a spiritual seal.  

Anointing, in Biblical and other ancient symbolism, is rich in meaning: 
oil is a sign of abundance and joy;102 it cleanses (anointing before and 
after a bath) and limbers (the anointing of athletes and wrestlers); oil is 
a sign of healing, since it is soothing to bruises and wounds;103 and it 
makes radiant with beauty, health, and strength. 

1294 Anointing with oil has all these meanings in the sacramental life. 
the pre-baptismal anointing with the oil of catechumens signifies 
cleansing and strengthening; the anointing of the sick expresses healing 



and comfort. the post-baptismal anointing with sacred chrism in 
Confirmation and ordination is the sign of consecration. By 
Confirmation Christians, that is, those who are anointed, share more 
completely in the mission of Jesus Christ and the fullness of the Holy 
Spirit with which he is filled, so that their lives may give off "the aroma 
of Christ."104 

1295 By this anointing the confirmand receives the "mark," the seal of 
the Holy Spirit. A seal is a symbol of a person, a sign of personal 
authority, or ownership of an oblect.105 Hence soldiers were marked 
with their leader's seal and slaves with their master's. A seal 
authenticates a juridical act or document and occasionally makes it 
secret.106 

1296 Christ himself declared that he was marked with his Father's 
seal.107 Christians are also marked with a seal: "It is God who 
establishes us with you in Christ and has commissioned us; he has put 
his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee."108 
This seal of the Holy Spirit marks our total belonging to Christ, our 
enrollment in his service for ever, as well as the promise of divine 
protection in the great eschatological trial.109 

The celebration of Confirmation 

1297 The consecration of the sacred chrism is an important action that 
precedes the celebration of Confirmation, but is in a certain way a part 
of it. It is the bishop who, in the course of the Chrism Mass of Holy 
Thursday, consecrates the sacred chrism for his whole diocese. In some 
Eastern Churches this consecration is even reserved to the patriarch: 

The liturgy of Antioch expresses the epiclesis for the consecration of 
the sacred chrism (myron) in this way: "[Father . . . send your Holy 
Spirit] on us and on this oil which is before us and consecrate it, so 
that it may be for all who are anointed and marked with it holy myron, 
priestly myron, royal myron, anointing with gladness, clothing with 
light, a cloak of salvation, a spiritual gift, the sanctification of souls and 
bodies, imperishable happiness, the indelible seal, a buckler of faith, 
and a fearsome helmet against all the works of the adversary." 

1298 When Confirmation is celebrated separately from Baptism, as is 
the case in the Roman Rite, the Liturgy of Confirmation begins with 



the renewal of baptismal promises and the profession of faith by the 
confirmands. This clearly shows that Confirmation follows 
Baptism.110 When adults are baptized, they immediately receive 
Confirmation and participate in the Eucharist.111 

1299 In the Roman Rite the bishop extends his hands over the whole 
group of the confirmands. Since the time of the apostles this gesture 
has signified the gift of the Spirit. the bishop invokes the outpouring of 
the Spirit in these words: 

All-powerful God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

by water and the Holy Spirit 

you freed your sons and daughters from sin 

and gave them new life. 

Send your Holy Spirit upon them 

to be their helper and guide. 

Give them the spirit of wisdom and understanding, 

the spirit of right judgment and courage, 

the spirit of knowledge and reverence. 

Fill them with the spirit of wonder and awe in your presence. 

We ask this through Christ our Lord.112 

1300 The essential rite of the sacrament follows. In the Latin rite, "the 
sacrament of Confirmation is conferred through the anointing with 
chrism on the forehead, which is done by the laying on of the hand, 
and through the words: Accipe signaculum doni Spiritus Sancti [Be 
sealed with the Gift of the Holy Spirit.]."113 In the Eastern Churches, 
after a prayer of epiclesis the more significant parts of the body are 
anointed with myron: forehead, eyes, nose, ears, lips, chest, back, 
hands, and feet. Each anointing is accompanied by the formula: 
GND"(4H *TNg"H A&lt;gb:"J@H !(4@b(Signaculum doni Spiritus 
Sancti): "The seal of the gift that is the Holy Spirit."113B 



1301 The sign of peace that concludes the rite of the sacrament 
signifies and demonstrates ecclesial communion with the bishop and 
with all the faithful.114

III. The Effects of Confirmation 

1302 It is evident from its celebration that the effect of the sacrament 
of Confirmation is the special outpouring of the Holy Spirit as once 
granted to the apostles on the day of Pentecost. 



1303 From this fact, Confirmation brings an increase and deepening 
of baptismal grace:  

- it roots us more deeply in the divine filiation which makes us cry, 
"Abba! Father!";115  

- it unites us more firmly to Christ;  

- it increases the gifts of the Holy Spirit in us;  

- it renders our bond with the Church more perfect;116  

- it gives us a special strength of the Holy Spirit to spread and defend 
the faith by word and action as true witnesses of Christ, to confess the 
name of Christ boldly, and never to be ashamed of the Cross:117 

Recall then that you have received the spiritual seal, the spirit of 
wisdom and understanding, the spirit of right judgment and courage, 
the spirit of knowledge and reverence, the spirit of holy fear in God's 
presence. Guard what you have received. God the Father has marked 
you with his sign; Christ the Lord has confirmed you and has placed 
his pledge, the Spirit, in your hearts.118 

1304 Like Baptism which it completes, Confirmation is given only 
once, for it too imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual mark, the 
"character," which is the sign that Jesus Christ has marked a Christian 
with the seal of his Spirit by clothing him with power from on high so 
that he may be his witness.119 

1305 This "character" perfects the common priesthood of the faithful, 
received in Baptism, and "the confirmed person receives the power to 
profess faith in Christ publicly and as it were officially (quasi ex 
officio)."12

IV. Who can Receive This Sacrament? 

1306 Every baptized person not yet confirmed can and should receive 
the sacrament of Confirmation.121 Since Baptism, Confirmation, and 
Eucharist form a unity, it follows that "the faithful are obliged to 
receive this sacrament at the appropriate time,"122 for without 
Confirmation and Eucharist, Baptism is certainly valid and efficacious, 
but Christian initiation remains incomplete. 

1307 For centuries, Latin custom has indicated "the age of discretion" 
as the reference point for receiving Confirmation. But in danger of 
death children should be confirmed even if they have not yet attained 
the age of discretion.123 

1308 Although Confirmation is sometimes called the "sacrament of 
Christian maturity," we must not confuse adult faith with the adult age 
of natural growth, nor forget that the baptismal grace is a grace of free, 
unmerited election and does not need "ratification" to become 
effective. St. Thomas reminds us of this: 



Age of body does not determine age of soul. Even in childhood man 
can attain spiritual maturity: as the book of Wisdom says: "For old age 
is not honored for length of time, or measured by number of years. 
"Many children, through the strength of the Holy Spirit they have 
received, have bravely fought for Christ even to the shedding of their 
blood.124 

1309 Preparation for Confirmation should aim at leading the Christian 
toward a more intimate union with Christ and a more lively familiarity 
with the Holy Spirit - his actions, his gifts, and his biddings - in order 
to be more capable of assuming the apostolic responsibilities of 
Christian life. To this end catechesis for Confirmation should strive to 
awaken a sense of belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ, the 
universal Church as well as the parish community. the latter bears 
special responsibility for the preparation of confirmands.125 

1310 To receive Confirmation one must be in a state of grace. One 
should receive the sacrament of Penance in order to be cleansed for the 
gift of the Holy Spirit. More intense prayer should prepare one to 
receive the strength and graces of the Holy Spirit with docility and 
readiness to act.126 

1311 Candidates for Confirmation, as for Baptism, fittingly seek the 
spiritual help of a sponsor. To emphasize the unity of the two 
sacraments, it is appropriate that this be one of the baptismal 
godparents.127

V. The Minister of Confirmation 

1312 The original minister of Confirmation is the bishop.128 In the 
East, ordinarily the priest who baptizes also immediately confers 
Confirmation in one and the same celebration. But he does so with 
sacred chrism consecrated by the patriarch or the bishop, thus 
expressing the apostolic unity of the Church whose bonds are 
strengthened by the sacrament of Confirmation. In the Latin Church, 
the same discipline applies to the Baptism of adults or to the reception 
into full communion with the Church of a person baptized in another 
Christian community that does not have valid Confirmation.129 

1313 In the Latin Rite, the ordinary minister of Confirmation is the 
bishop.130 If the need arises, the bishop may grant the faculty of 
administering Confirmation to priests,131 although it is fitting that he 
confers it himself, mindful that the celebration of Confirmation has 
been temporally separated from Baptism for this reason. Bishops are 
the successors of the apostles. They have received the fullness of the 
sacrament of Holy Orders. the administration of this sacrament by 



them demonstrates clearly that its effect is to unite those who receive it 
more closely to the Church, to her apostolic origins, and to her mission 
of bearing witness to Christ. 

1314 If a Christian is in danger of death, any priest can give him 
Confirmation.132 Indeed the Church desires that none of her 
children, even the youngest, should depart this world without having 
been perfected by the Holy Spirit with the gift of Christ's fullness.

Article 2 THE SACRAMENT OF CONFIRMATION 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

1315 "Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had 
received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John, who came 
down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit; for 



it had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in 
the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they laid their hands on them and 
they received the Holy Spirit" (Acts 8:14-17). 

1316 Confirmation perfects Baptismal grace; it is the sacrament which 
gives the Holy Spirit in order to root us more deeply in the divine 
filiation, incorporate us more firmly into Christ, strengthen our bond 
with the Church, associate us more closely with her mission, and help 
us bear witness to the Christian faith in words accompanied by deeds. 

1317 Confirmation, like Baptism, imprints a spiritual mark or indelible 
character on the Christian's soul; for this reason one can receive this 
sacrament only once in one's life. 

1318 In the East this sacrament is administered immediately after 
Baptism and is followed by participation in the Eucharist; this tradition 
highlights the unity of the three sacraments of Christian initiation. In 
the Latin Church this sacrament is administered when the age of 
reason has been reached, and its celebration is ordinarily reserved to 
the bishop, thus signifying that this sacrament strengthens the ecclesial 
bond. 

1319 A candidate for Confirmation who has attained the age of reason 
must profess the faith, be in the state of grace, have the intention of 
receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to assume the role of disciple 
and witness to Christ, both within the ecclesial community and in 
temporal affairs. 

1320 The essential rite of Confirmation is anointing the forehead of 
the baptized with sacred chrism (in the East other sense-organs as 
well), together with the laying on of the minister's hand and the words: 
"Accipe signaculum doni Spiritus Sancti" (Be sealed with the Gift of 
the Holy Spirit.) in the Roman Rite, or Signaculum doni Spiritus 
Sancti (The seal of the gift that is the Holy Spirit) in the Byzantine 
rite. 

1321 When Confirmation is celebrated separately from Baptism, its 
connection with Baptism is expressed, among other ways, by the 
renewal of baptismal promises. the celebration of Confirmation during 
the Eucharist helps underline the unity of the sacraments of Christian 
initiation.

Article 3 THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST 

1322 The holy Eucharist completes Christian initiation. Those who 
have been raised to the dignity of the royal priesthood by Baptism and 
configured more deeply to Christ by Confirmation participate with the 



whole community in the Lord's own sacrifice by means of the 
Eucharist. 

1323 "At the Last Supper, on the night he was betrayed, our Savior 
instituted the Eucharistic sacrifice of his Body and Blood. This he did 
in order to perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross throughout the ages 
until he should come again, and so to entrust to his beloved Spouse, 
the Church, a memorial of his death and resurrection: a sacrament of 
love, a sign of unity, a bond of charity, a Paschal banquet 'in which 
Christ is consumed, the mind is filled with grace, and a pledge of 
future glory is given to us.'"133

I. The Eucharist - Source and Summit of Ecclesial Life 

1324 The Eucharist is "the source and summit of the Christian 
life."134 "The other sacraments, and indeed all ecclesiastical ministries 
and works of the apostolate, are bound up with the Eucharist and are 
oriented toward it. For in the blessed Eucharist is contained the whole 
spiritual good of the Church, namely Christ himself, our Pasch."135 

1325 "The Eucharist is the efficacious sign and sublime cause of that 
communion in the divine life and that unity of the People of God by 
which the Church is kept in being. It is the culmination both of God's 
action sanctifying the world in Christ and of the worship men offer to 
Christ and through him to the Father in the Holy Spirit."136 

1326 Finally, by the Eucharistic celebration we already unite ourselves 
with the heavenly liturgy and anticipate eternal life, when God will be 
all in all.137 

1327 In brief, the Eucharist is the sum and summary of our faith: "Our 
way of thinking is attuned to the Eucharist, and the Eucharist in turn 
confirms our way of thinking."138

II. What is This Sacrament Called? 

1328 The inexhaustible richness of this sacrament is expressed in the 
different names we give it. Each name evokes certain aspects of it. It is 
called: Eucharist, because it is an action of thanksgiving to God. the 
Greek words eucharistein139 and eulogein140 recall the Jewish 
blessings that proclaim - especially during a meal - God's works: 
creation, redemption, and sanctification. 

1329 The Lord's Supper, because of its connection with the supper 
which the Lord took with his disciples on the eve of his Passion and 
because it anticipates the wedding feast of the Lamb in the heavenly 
Jerusalem.141  



The Breaking of Bread, because Jesus used this rite, part of a Jewish 
meat when as master of the table he blessed and distributed the 
bread,142 above all at the Last Supper.143 It is by this action that his 
disciples will recognize him after his Resurrection,144 and it is this 
expression that the first Christians will use to designate their 
Eucharistic assemblies;145 by doing so they signified that all who eat 
the one broken bread, Christ, enter into communion with him and 
form but one body in him.146  

The Eucharistic assembly (synaxis), because the Eucharist is 
celebrated amid the assembly of the faithful, the visible expression of 
the Church.147 

1330 The memorial of the Lord's Passion and Resurrection.  

The Holy Sacrifice, because it makes present the one sacrifice of 
Christ the Savior and includes the Church's offering. the terms holy 
sacrifice of the Mass, "sacrifice of praise," spiritual sacrifice, pure and 
holy sacrifice are also used,148 since it completes and surpasses all the 
sacrifices of the Old Covenant.  

The Holy and Divine Liturgy, because the Church's whole liturgy finds 
its center and most intense expression in the celebration of this 
sacrament; in the same sense we also call its celebration the Sacred 
Mysteries. We speak of the Most Blessed Sacrament because it is the 
Sacrament of sacraments. the Eucharistic species reserved in the 
tabernacle are designated by this same name. 

1331 Holy Communion, because by this sacrament we unite ourselves 
to Christ, who makes us sharers in his Body and Blood to form a single 
body.149 We also call it: the holy things (ta hagia; sancta)150 - the first 
meaning of the phrase "communion of saints" in the Apostles' Creed - 
the bread of angels, bread from heaven, medicine of immortality,151 
viaticum.... 

1332 Holy Mass (Missa), because the liturgy in which the mystery of 
salvation is accomplished concludes with the sending forth (missio) of 
the faithful, so that they may fulfill God's will in their daily lives.

1333 At the heart of the Eucharistic celebration are the bread and wine 
that, by the words of Christ and the invocation of the Holy Spirit, 
become Christ's Body and Blood. Faithful to the Lord's command the 
Church continues to do, in his memory and until his glorious return, 
what he did on the eve of his Passion: "He took bread...." "He took the 
cup filled with wine...." the signs of bread and wine become, in a way 
surpassing understanding, the Body and Blood of Christ; they 
continue also to signify the goodness of creation. Thus in the Offertory 
we give thanks to the Creator for bread and wine,152 fruit of the "work 
of human hands," but above all as "fruit of the earth" and "of the vine" 
- gifts of the Creator. the Church sees in the gesture of the king-priest 
Melchizedek, who "brought out bread and wine," a prefiguring of her 
own offering.153 

1334 In the Old Covenant bread and wine were offered in sacrifice 
among the first fruits of the earth as a sign of grateful acknowledgment 
to the Creator. But they also received a new significance in the context 
of the Exodus: the unleavened bread that Israel eats every year at 



Passover commemorates the haste of the departure that liberated them 
from Egypt; the remembrance of the manna in the desert will always 
recall to Israel that it lives by the bread of the Word of God;154 their 
daily bread is the fruit of the promised land, the pledge of God's 
faithfulness to his promises.  

The "cup of blessing"155 at the end of the Jewish Passover meal adds 
to the festive joy of wine an eschatological dimension: the messianic 
expectation of the rebuilding of Jerusalem. When Jesus instituted the 
Eucharist, he gave a new and definitive meaning to the blessing of the 
bread and the cup. 

1335 The miracles of the multiplication of the loaves, when the Lord 
says the blessing, breaks and distributes the loaves through his disciples 
to feed the multitude, prefigure the superabundance of this unique 
bread of his Eucharist.156 The sign of water turned into wine at Cana 
already announces the Hour of Jesus' glorification. It makes manifest 
the fulfillment of the wedding feast in the Father's kingdom, where the 
faithful will drink the new wine that has become the Blood of 
Christ.157 

1336 The first announcement of the Eucharist divided the disciples, 
just as the announcement of the Passion scandalized them: "This is a 
hard saying; who can listen to it?"158 The Eucharist and the Cross are 
stumbling blocks. It is the same mystery and it never ceases to be an 
occasion of division. "Will you also go away?":159 The Lord's question 
echoes through the ages, as a loving invitation to discover that only he 
has "the words of eternal life"160 and that to receive in faith the gift of 
his Eucharist is to receive the Lord himself. 

The institution of the Eucharist 

1337 The Lord, having loved those who were his own, loved them to 
the end. Knowing that the hour had come to leave this world and 
return to the Father, in the course of a meal he washed their feet and 
gave them the commandment of love.161 In order to leave them a 
pledge of this love, in order never to depart from his own and to make 
them sharers in his Passover, he instituted the Eucharist as the 
memorial of his death and Resurrection, and commanded his apostles 



to celebrate it until his return; "thereby he constituted them priests of 
the New Testament."162 

1338 The three synoptic Gospels and St. Paul have handed on to us 
the account of the institution of the Eucharist; St. John, for his part, 
reports the words of Jesus in the synagogue of Capernaum that prepare 
for the institution of the Eucharist: Christ calls himself the bread of 
life, come down from heaven.163 

1339 Jesus chose the time of Passover to fulfill what he had announced 
at Capernaum: giving his disciples his Body and his Blood: 

Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the passover lamb 
had to be sacrificed. So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and 
prepare the passover meal for us, that we may eat it...." They went ... 
and prepared the passover. and when the hour came, he sat at table, 
and the apostles with him. and he said to them, "I have earnestly 
desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer; for I tell you I shall 
not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.".... and he 
took bread, and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave it to 
them, saying, "This is my body which is given for you. Do this in 
remembrance of me." and likewise the cup after supper, saying, "This 
cup which is poured out for you is the New Covenant in my 
blood."164 

1340 By celebrating the Last Supper with his apostles in the course of 
the Passover meal, Jesus gave the Jewish Passover its definitive 
meaning. Jesus' passing over to his father by his death and 
Resurrection, the new Passover, is anticipated in the Supper and 
celebrated in the Eucharist, which fulfills the Jewish Passover and 
anticipates the final Passover of the Church in the glory of the 
kingdom. 

"Do this in memory of me" 

1341 The command of Jesus to repeat his actions and words "until he 
comes" does not only ask us to remember Jesus and what he did. It is 
directed at the liturgical celebration, by the apostles and their 
successors, of the memorial of Christ, of his life, of his death, of his 
Resurrection, and of his intercession in the presence of the Father.165 



1342 From the beginning the Church has been faithful to the Lord's 
command. of the Church of Jerusalem it is written: 

They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to 
the breaking of bread and the prayers.... Day by day, attending the 
temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they partook of 
food with glad and generous hearts.166 

1343 It was above all on "the first day of the week," Sunday, the day of 
Jesus' resurrection, that the Christians met "to break bread."167 From 
that time on down to our own day the celebration of the Eucharist has 
been continued so that today we encounter it everywhere in the 
Church with the same fundamental structure. It remains the center of 
the Church's life. 

1344 Thus from celebration to celebration, as they proclaim the 
Paschal mystery of Jesus "until he comes," the pilgrim People of God 
advances, "following the narrow way of the cross,"168 toward the 
heavenly banquet, when all the elect will be seated at the table of the 
kingdom.

IV. The Liturgical Celebration of the Eucharist 

The Mass of all ages 

1345 As early as the second century we have the witness of St. Justin 
Martyr for the basic lines of the order of the Eucharistic celebration. 
They have stayed the same until our own day for all the great liturgical 
families. St. Justin wrote to the pagan emperor Antoninus Pius (138-
161) around the year 155, explaining what Christians did: 

On the day we call the day of the sun, all who dwell in the city or 
country gather in the same place.  

The memoirs of the apostles and the writings of the prophets are read, 
as much as time permits.  

When the reader has finished, he who presides over those gathered 
admonishes and challenges them to imitate these beautiful things.  

Then we all rise together and offer prayers* for ourselves . . .and for all 
others, wherever they may be, so that we may be found righteous by 
our life and actions, and faithful to the commandments, so as to obtain 
eternal salvation.  



When the prayers are concluded we exchange the kiss.  

Then someone brings bread and a cup of water and wine mixed 
together to him who presides over the brethren.  

He takes them and offers praise and glory to the Father of the universe, 
through the name of the Son and of the Holy  

Spirit and for a considerable time he gives thanks (in Greek: 
eucharistian) that we have been judged worthy of these gifts.  

When he has concluded the prayers and thanksgivings, all present give 
voice to an acclamation by saying: 'Amen.'  

When he who presides has given thanks and the people have 
responded, those whom we call deacons give to those present the 
"eucharisted" bread, wine and water and take them to those who are 
absent.169 

1346 The liturgy of the Eucharist unfolds according to a fundamental 
structure which has been preserved throughout the centuries down to 
our own day. It displays two great parts that form a fundamental unity:  

- the gathering, the liturgy of the Word, with readings, homily and 
general intercessions;  

- the liturgy of the Eucharist, with the presentation of the bread and 
wine, the consecratory thanksgiving, and communion.  

The liturgy of the Word and liturgy of the Eucharist together form "one 
single act of worship";170 The Eucharistic table set for us is the table 
both of the Word of God and of the Body of the Lord.171 

1347 Is this not the same movement as the Paschal meal of the risen 
Jesus with his disciples? Walking with them he explained the Scriptures 
to them; sitting with them at table "he took bread, blessed and broke it, 
and gave it to them."172 

The movement of the celebration 

1348 All gather together. Christians come together in one place for the 
Eucharistic assembly. At its head is Christ himself, the principal agent 
of the Eucharist. He is high priest of the New Covenant; it is he 
himself who presides invisibly over every Eucharistic celebration. It is 



in representing him that the bishop or priest acting in the person of 
Christ the head (in persona Christi capitis) presides over the assembly, 
speaks after the readings, receives the offerings, and says the 
Eucharistic Prayer. All have their own active parts to play in the 
celebration, each in his own way: readers, those who bring up the 
offerings, those who give communion, and the whole people whose 
"Amen" manifests their participation. 

1349 The Liturgy of the Word includes "the writings of the prophets," 
that is, the Old Testament, and "the memoirs of the apostles" (their 
letters and the Gospels). After the homily, which is an exhortation to 
accept this Word as what it truly is, the Word of God,173 and to put it 
into practice, come the intercessions for all men, according to the 
Apostle's words: "I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and 
thanksgivings be made for all men, for kings, and all who are in high 
positions."174 

1350 The presentation of the offerings (the Offertory). Then, 
sometimes in procession, the bread and wine are brought to the altar; 
they will be offered by the priest in the name of Christ in the 
Eucharistic sacrifice in which they will become his body and blood. It 
is the very action of Christ at the Last Supper - "taking the bread and a 
cup." "The Church alone offers this pure oblation to the Creator, when 
she offers what comes forth from his creation with thanksgiving."175 
The presentation of the offerings at the altar takes up the gesture of 
Melchizedek and commits the Creator's gifts into the hands of Christ 
who, in his sacrifice, brings to perfection all human attempts to offer 
sacrifices. 

1351 From the very beginning Christians have brought, along with the 
bread and wine for the Eucharist, gifts to share with those in need. 
This custom of the collection, ever appropriate, is inspired by the 
example of Christ who became poor to make us rich:176 

Those who are well off, and who are also willing, give as each chooses. 
What is gathered is given to him who presides to assist orphans and 
widows, those whom illness or any other cause has deprived of 
resources, prisoners, immigrants and, in a word, all who are in 
need.177 



1352 he anaphora: with the Eucharistic Prayer - the prayer of 
thanksgiving and consecration - we come to the heart and summit of 
the celebration: 

In the preface, the Church gives thanks to the Father, through Christ, 
in the Holy Spirit, for all his works: creation, redemption, and 
sanctification. the whole community thus joins in the unending praise 
that the Church in heaven, the angels and all the saints, sing to the 
thrice-holy God. 

1353 In the epiclesis, the Church asks the Father to send his Holy 
Spirit (or the power of his blessing178) on the bread and wine, so that 
by his power they may become the body and blood of Jesus Christ and 
so that those who take part in the Eucharist may be one body and one 
spirit (some liturgical traditions put the epiclesis after the anamnesis).  

In the institution narrative, the power of the words and the action of 
Christ, and the power of the Holy Spirit, make sacramentally present 
under the species of bread and wine Christ's body and blood, his 
sacrifice offered on the cross once for all. 

1354 In the anamnesis that follows, the Church calls to mind the 
Passion, resurrection, and glorious return of Christ Jesus; she presents 
to the Father the offering of his Son which reconciles us with him.  

In the intercessions, the Church indicates that the Eucharist is 
celebrated in communion with the whole Church in heaven and on 
earth, the living and the dead, and in communion with the pastors of 
the Church, the Pope, the diocesan bishop, his presbyterium and his 
deacons, and all the bishops of the whole world together with their 
Churches. 

1355 In the communion, preceded by the Lord's prayer and the 
breaking of the bread, the faithful receive "the bread of heaven" and 
"the cup of salvation," the body and blood of Christ who offered 
himself "for the life of the world":179 

Because this bread and wine have been made Eucharist ("eucharisted," 
according to an ancient expression), "we call this food Eucharist, and 
no one may take part in it unless he believes that what we teach is true, 



has received baptism for the forgiveness of sins and new birth, and lives 
in keeping with what Christ taught."180

V. The Sacramental Sacrifice Thanksgiving, Memorial, Presence 

1356 If from the beginning Christians have celebrated the Eucharist 
and in a form whose substance has not changed despite the great 
diversity of times and liturgies, it is because we know ourselves to be 
bound by the command the Lord gave on the eve of his Passion: "Do 
this in remembrance of me."181 

1357 We carry out this command of the Lord by celebrating the 
memorial of his sacrifice. In so doing, we offer to the Father what he 
has himself given us: the gifts of his creation, bread and wine which, by 
the power of the Holy Spirit and by the words of Christ, have become 
the body and blood of Christ. Christ is thus really and mysteriously 
made present. 

1358 We must therefore consider the Eucharist as: - thanksgiving and 
praise to the Father;  

- the sacrificial memorial of Christ and his Body;  

- the presence of Christ by the power of his word and of his Spirit. 



Thanksgiving and praise to the Father 

1359 The Eucharist, the sacrament of our salvation accomplished by 
Christ on the cross, is also a sacrifice of praise in thanksgiving for the 
work of creation. In the Eucharistic sacrifice the whole of creation 
loved by God is presented to the Father through the death and the 
Resurrection of Christ. Through Christ the Church can offer the 
sacrifice of praise in thanksgiving for all that God has made good, 
beautiful, and just in creation and in humanity. 

1360 The Eucharist is a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the Father, a 
blessing by which the Church expresses her gratitude to God for all his 
benefits, for all that he has accomplished through creation, 
redemption, and sanctification. Eucharist means first of all 
"thanksgiving." 

1361 The Eucharist is also the sacrifice of praise by which the Church 
sings the glory of God in the name of all creation. This sacrifice of 
praise is possible only through Christ: he unites the faithful to his 
person, to his praise, and to his intercession, so that the sacrifice of 
praise to the Father is offered through Christ and with him, to be 
accepted in him. 

The sacrificial memorial of Christ and of his Body, the Church 

1362 The Eucharist is the memorial of Christ's Passover, the making 
present and the sacramental offering of his unique sacrifice, in the 
liturgy of the Church which is his Body. In all the Eucharistic Prayers 
we find after the words of institution a prayer called the anamnesis or 
memorial. 

1363 In the sense of Sacred Scripture the memorial is not merely the 
recollection of past events but the proclamation of the mighty works 
wrought by God for men.182 In the liturgical celebration of these 
events, they become in a certain way present and real. This is how 
Israel understands its liberation from Egypt: every time Passover is 
celebrated, the Exodus events are made present to the memory of 
believers so that they may conform their lives to them. 

1364 In the New Testament, the memorial takes on new meaning. 
When the Church celebrates the Eucharist, she commemorates 



Christ's Passover, and it is made present the sacrifice Christ offered 
once for all on the cross remains ever present.183 "As often as the 
sacrifice of the Cross by which 'Christ our Pasch has been sacrificed' is 
celebrated on the altar, the work of our redemption is carried out."184 

1365 Because it is the memorial of Christ's Passover, the Eucharist is 
also a sacrifice. the sacrificial character of the Eucharist is manifested 
in the very words of institution: "This is my body which is given for 
you" and "This cup which is poured out for you is the New Covenant 
in my blood."185 In the Eucharist Christ gives us the very body which 
he gave up for us on the cross, the very blood which he "poured out for 
many for the forgiveness of sins."186 

1366 The Eucharist is thus a sacrifice because it re-presents (makes 
present) the sacrifice of the cross, because it is its memorial and 
because it applies its fruit: 

[Christ], our Lord and God, was once and for all to offer himself to 
God the Father by his death on the altar of the cross, to accomplish 
there an everlasting redemption. But because his priesthood was not to 
end with his death, at the Last Supper "on the night when he was 
betrayed," [he wanted] to leave to his beloved spouse the Church a 
visible sacrifice (as the nature of man demands) by which the bloody 
sacrifice which he was to accomplish once for all on the cross would be 
re-presented, its memory perpetuated until the end of the world, and 
its salutary power be applied to the forgiveness of the sins we daily 
commit.187 

1367 The sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Eucharist are one 
single sacrifice: "The victim is one and the same: the same now offers 
through the ministry of priests, who then offered himself on the cross; 
only the manner of offering is different." "And since in this divine 
sacrifice which is celebrated in the Mass, the same Christ who offered 
himself once in a bloody manner on the altar of the cross is contained 
and is offered in an unbloody manner... this sacrifice is truly 
propitiatory."188 

1368 The Eucharist is also the sacrifice of the Church. the Church 
which is the Body of Christ participates in the offering of her Head. 
With him, she herself is offered whole and entire. She unites herself to 



his intercession with the Father for all men. In the Eucharist the 
sacrifice of Christ becomes also the sacrifice of the members of his 
Body. the lives of the faithful, their praise, sufferings, prayer, and work, 
are united with those of Christ and with his total offering, and so 
acquire a new value. Christ's sacrifice present on the altar makes it 
possible for all generations of Christians to be united with his offering. 

In the catacombs the Church is often represented as a woman in 
prayer, arms outstretched in the praying position. Like Christ who 
stretched out his arms on the cross, through him, with him, and in 
him, she offers herself and intercedes for all men. 

1369 The whole Church is united with the offering and intercession of 
Christ. Since he has the ministry of Peter in the Church, the Pope is 
associated with every celebration of the Eucharist, wherein he is named 
as the sign and servant of the unity of the universal Church. the bishop 
of the place is always responsible for the Eucharist, even when a priest 
presides; the bishop's name is mentioned to signify his presidency over 
the particular Church, in the midst of his presbyterium and with the 
assistance of deacons. the community intercedes also for all ministers 
who, for it and with it, offer the Eucharistic sacrifice: 

Let only that Eucharist be regarded as legitimate, which is celebrated 
under [the presidency of] the bishop or him to whom he has entrusted 
it.189 

Through the ministry of priests the spiritual sacrifice of the faithful is 
completed in union with the sacrifice of Christ the only Mediator, 
which in the Eucharist is offered through the priests' hands in the 
name of the whole Church in an unbloody and sacramental manner 
until the Lord himself comes.190 

1370 To the offering of Christ are united not only the members still 
here on earth, but also those already in the glory of heaven. In 
communion with and commemorating the Blessed Virgin Mary and all 
the saints, the Church offers the Eucharistic sacrifice. In the Eucharist 
the Church is as it were at the foot of the cross with Mary, united with 
the offering and intercession of Christ. 



1371 The Eucharistic sacrifice is also offered for the faithful departed 
who "have died in Christ but are not yet wholly purified,"191 so that 
they may be able to enter into the light and peace of Christ: 

Put this body anywhere! Don't trouble yourselves about it! I simply ask 
you to remember me at the Lord's altar wherever you are.192 

Then, we pray [in the anaphora] for the holy fathers and bishops who 
have fallen asleep, and in general for all who have fallen asleep before 
us, in the belief that it is a great benefit to the souls on whose behalf 
the supplication is offered, while the holy and tremendous Victim is 
present.... By offering to God our supplications for those who have 
fallen asleep, if they have sinned, we . . . offer Christ sacrificed for the 
sins of all, and so render favorable, for them and for us, the God who 
loves man.193 

1372 St. Augustine admirably summed up this doctrine that moves us 
to an ever more complete participation in our Redeemer's sacrifice 
which we celebrate in the Eucharist: 

This wholly redeemed city, the assembly and society of the saints, is 
offered to God as a universal sacrifice by the high priest who in the 
form of a slave went so far as to offer himself for us in his Passion, to 
make us the Body of so great a head.... Such is the sacrifice of 
Christians: "we who are many are one Body in Christ" the Church 
continues to reproduce this sacrifice in the sacrament of the altar so 
well-known to believers wherein it is evident to them that in what she 
offers she herself is offered.194 

The presence of Christ by the power of his word and the Holy Spirit 

1373 "Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised from the dead, who 
is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us," is present in 
many ways to his Church:195 in his word, in his Church's prayer, 
"where two or three are gathered in my name,"196 in the poor, the 
sick, and the imprisoned,197 in the sacraments of which he is the 
author, in the sacrifice of the Mass, and in the person of the minister. 
But "he is present . . . most especially in the Eucharistic species."198 

1374 The mode of Christ's presence under the Eucharistic species is 
unique. It raises the Eucharist above all the sacraments as "the 



perfection of the spiritual life and the end to which all the sacraments 
tend."199 In the most blessed sacrament of the Eucharist "the body 
and blood, together with the soul and divinity, of our Lord Jesus Christ 
and, therefore, the whole Christ is truly, really, and substantially 
contained."200 "This presence is called 'real' - by which is not 
intended to exclude the other types of presence as if they could not be 
'real' too, but because it is presence in the fullest sense: that is to say, it 
is a substantial presence by which Christ, God and man, makes himself 
wholly and entirely present."201 

1375 It is by the conversion of the bread and wine into Christ's body 
and blood that Christ becomes present in this sacrament. the Church 
Fathers strongly affirmed the faith of the Church in the efficacy of the 
Word of Christ and of the action of the Holy Spirit to bring about this 
conversion. Thus St. John Chrysostom declares: 

It is not man that causes the things offered to become the Body and 
Blood of Christ, but he who was crucified for us, Christ himself. the 
priest, in the role of Christ, pronounces these words, but their power 
and grace are God's. This is my body, he says. This word transforms 
the things offered.202 

and St. Ambrose says about this conversion: 

Be convinced that this is not what nature has formed, but what the 
blessing has consecrated. the power of the blessing prevails over that of 
nature, because by the blessing nature itself is changed.... Could not 
Christ's word, which can make from nothing what did not exist, change 
existing things into what they were not before? It is no less a feat to 
give things their original nature than to change their nature.203 

1376 The Council of Trent summarizes the Catholic faith by declaring: 
"Because Christ our Redeemer said that it was truly his body that he 
was offering under the species of bread, it has always been the 
conviction of the Church of God, and this holy Council now declares 
again, that by the consecration of the bread and wine there takes place 
a change of the whole substance of the bread into the substance of the 
body of Christ our Lord and of the whole substance of the wine into 
the substance of his blood. This change the holy Catholic Church has 
fittingly and properly called transubstantiation."204 



1377 The Eucharistic presence of Christ begins at the moment of the 
consecration and endures as long as the Eucharistic species subsist. 
Christ is present whole and entire in each of the species and whole and 
entire in each of their parts, in such a way that the breaking of the 
bread does not divide Christ.205 

1378 Worship of the Eucharist. In the liturgy of the Mass we express 
our faith in the real presence of Christ under the species of bread and 
wine by, among other ways, genuflecting or bowing deeply as a sign of 
adoration of the Lord. "The Catholic Church has always offered and 
still offers to the sacrament of the Eucharist the cult of adoration, not 
only during Mass, but also outside of it, reserving the consecrated 
hosts with the utmost care, exposing them to the solemn veneration of 
the faithful, and carrying them in procession."206 

1379 The tabernacle was first intended for the reservation of the 
Eucharist in a worthy place so that it could be brought to the sick and 
those absent outside of Mass. As faith in the real presence of Christ in 
his Eucharist deepened, the Church became conscious of the meaning 
of silent adoration of the Lord present under the Eucharistic species. It 
is for this reason that the tabernacle should be located in an especially 
worthy place in the church and should be constructed in such a way 
that it emphasizes and manifests the truth of the real presence of 
Christ in the Blessed Sacrament. 

1380 It is highly fitting that Christ should have wanted to remain 
present to his Church in this unique way. Since Christ was about to 
take his departure from his own in his visible form, he wanted to give 
us his sacramental presence; since he was about to offer himself on the 
cross to save us, he wanted us to have the memorial of the love with 
which he loved us "to the end,"207 even to the giving of his life. In his 
Eucharistic presence he remains mysteriously in our midst as the one 
who loved us and gave himself up for us,208 and he remains under 
signs that express and communicate this love: 

The Church and the world have a great need for Eucharistic worship. 
Jesus awaits us in this sacrament of love. Let us not refuse the time to 
go to meet him in adoration, in contemplation full of faith, and open to 
making amends for the serious offenses and crimes of the world. Let 
our adoration never cease.209 



1381 "That in this sacrament are the true Body of Christ and his true 
Blood is something that 'cannot be apprehended by the senses,' says St. 
Thomas, 'but only by faith, which relies on divine authority.' For this 
reason, in a commentary on Luke 22:19 ('This is my body which is 
given for you.'), St. Cyril says: 'Do not doubt whether this is true, but 
rather receive the words of the Savior in faith, for since he is the truth, 
he cannot lie.'"210 

Godhead here in hiding, whom I do adore 

Masked by these bare shadows, shape and nothing more, 

See, Lord, at thy service low lies here a heart 

Lost, all lost in wonder at the God thou art. 

 

Seeing, touching, tasting are in thee deceived;  

How says trusty hearing? that shall be believed;  

What God's Son has told me, take for truth I do;  

Truth himself speaks truly or there's nothing true.211

PART TWO: THE CELEBRATION OF THE CHRISTIAN 
MYSTERY 

 

 

 

SECTION TWO THE SEVEN SACRAMENTS OF THE CHURCH 

 



 

 

CHAPTER ONE THE SACRAMENTS OF CHRISTIAN 
INITIATION 

 

 

 

Article 3 THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST 

 

 

VI. The Paschal Banquet 

1382 The Mass is at the same time, and inseparably, the sacrificial 
memorial in which the sacrifice of the cross is perpetuated and the 
sacred banquet of communion with the Lord's body and blood. But 
the celebration of the Eucharistic sacrifice is wholly directed toward 
the intimate union of the faithful with Christ through communion. To 
receive communion is to receive Christ himself who has offered himself 
for us. 

1383 The altar, around which the Church is gathered in the 
celebration of the Eucharist, represents the two aspects of the same 
mystery: the altar of the sacrifice and the table of the Lord. This is all 
the more so since the Christian altar is the symbol of Christ himself, 
present in the midst of the assembly of his faithful, both as the victim 
offered for our reconciliation and as food from heaven who is giving 
himself to us. "For what is the altar of Christ if not the image of the 
Body of Christ?"212 asks St. Ambrose. He says elsewhere, "The altar 
represents the body [of Christ] and the Body of Christ is on the 
altar."213 The liturgy expresses this unity of sacrifice and communion 
in many prayers. Thus the Roman Church prays in its anaphora: 

We entreat you, almighty God, 

that by the hands of your holy Angel 



this offering may be borne to your altar in heaven 

in the sight of your divine majesty, 

so that as we receive in communion at this altar 

the most holy Body and Blood of your Son, 

we may be filled with every heavenly blessing and grace.214 

"Take this and eat it, all of you": communion 

1384 The Lord addresses an invitation to us, urging us to receive him 
in the sacrament of the Eucharist: "Truly, I say to you, unless you eat 
the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in 
you."215 

1385 To respond to this invitation we must prepare ourselves for so 
great and so holy a moment. St. Paul urges us to examine our 
conscience: "Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of 
the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body 
and blood of the Lord. Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the 
bread and drink of the cup. For any one who eats and drinks without 
discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself."216 
Anyone conscious of a grave sin must receive the sacrament of 
Reconciliation before coming to communion. 

1386 Before so great a sacrament, the faithful can only echo humbly 
and with ardent faith the words of the Centurion: "Domine, non sum 
dignus ut intres sub tectum meum, sed tantum dic verbo, et sanabitur 
anima mea" ("Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my 
roof, but only say the word and my soul will be healed.").217 and in 
the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom the faithful pray in the 
same spirit: 

O Son of God, bring me into communion today with your mystical 
supper. I shall not tell your enemies the secret, nor kiss you with Judas' 
kiss. But like the good thief I cry, "Jesus, remember me when you come 
into your kingdom." 

1387 To prepare for worthy reception of this sacrament, the faithful 
should observe the fast required in their Church.218 Bodily demeanor 



(gestures, clothing) ought to convey the respect, solemnity, and joy of 
this moment when Christ becomes our guest. 

1388 It is in keeping with the very meaning of the Eucharist that the 
faithful, if they have the required dispositions,.218B  receive 
communion when they participate in the Mass.219 As the Second 
Vatican Council says: "That more perfect form of participation in the 
Mass whereby the faithful, after the priest's communion, receive the 
Lord's Body from the same sacrifice, is warmly recommended."220 

1389 The Church obliges the faithful to take part in the Divine Liturgy 
on Sundays and feast days and, prepared by the sacrament of 
Reconciliation, to receive the Eucharist at least once a year, if possible 
during the Easter season.221 But the Church strongly encourages the 
faithful to receive the holy Eucharist on Sundays and feast days, or 
more often still, even daily. 

1390 Since Christ is sacramentally present under each of the species, 
communion under the species of bread alone makes it possible to 
receive all the fruit of Eucharistic grace. For pastoral reasons this 
manner of receiving communion has been legitimately established as 
the most common form in the Latin rite. But "the sign of communion 
is more complete when given under both kinds, since in that form the 
sign of the Eucharistic meal appears more clearly."222 This is the usual 
form of receiving communion in the Eastern rites. 

The fruits of Holy Communion 

1391 Holy Communion augments our union with Christ. the principal 
fruit of receiving the Eucharist in Holy Communion is an intimate 
union with Christ Jesus. Indeed, the Lord said: "He who eats my flesh 
and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him."223 Life in Christ has 
its foundation in the Eucharistic banquet: "As the living Father sent 
me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats me will live 
because of me."224 

On the feasts of the Lord, when the faithful receive the Body of the 
Son, they proclaim to one another the Good News that the first fruits 
of life have been given, as when the angel said to Mary Magdalene, 
"Christ is risen!" Now too are life and resurrection conferred on 
whoever receives Christ.225 



1392 What material food produces in our bodily life, Holy 
Communion wonderfully achieves in our spiritual life. Communion 
with the flesh of the risen Christ, a flesh "given life and giving life 
through the Holy Spirit,"226 preserves, increases, and renews the life 
of grace received at Baptism. This growth in Christian life needs the 
nourishment of Eucharistic Communion, the bread for our pilgrimage 
until the moment of death, when it will be given to us as viaticum. 

1393 Holy Communion separates us from sin. the body of Christ we 
receive in Holy Communion is "given up for us," and the blood we 
drink "shed for the many for the forgiveness of sins." For this reason 
the Eucharist cannot unite us to Christ without at the same time 
cleansing us from past sins and preserving us from future sins: 

For as often as we eat this bread and drink the cup, we proclaim the 
death of the Lord. If we proclaim the Lord's death, we proclaim the 
forgiveness of sins. If, as often as his blood is poured out, it is poured 
for the forgiveness of sins, I should always receive it, so that it may 
always forgive my sins. Because I always sin, I should always have a 
remedy.227 

1394 As bodily nourishment restores lost strength, so the Eucharist 
strengthens our charity, which tends to be weakened in daily life; and 
this living charity wipes away venial sins.228 By giving himself to us 
Christ revives our love and enables us to break our disordered 
attachments to creatures and root ourselves in him: 

Since Christ died for us out of love, when we celebrate the memorial of 
his death at the moment of sacrifice we ask that love may be granted to 
us by the coming of the Holy Spirit. We humbly pray that in the 
strength of this love by which Christ willed to die for us, we, by 
receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit, may be able to consider the world 
as crucified for us, and to be ourselves as crucified to the world.... 
Having received the gift of love, let us die to sin and live for God.229 

1395 By the same charity that it enkindles in us, the Eucharist 
preserves us from future mortal sins. the more we share the life of 
Christ and progress in his friendship, the more difficult it is to break 
away from him by mortal sin. the Eucharist is not ordered to the 
forgiveness of mortal sins - that is proper to the sacrament of 



Reconciliation. the Eucharist is properly the sacrament of those who 
are in full communion with the Church. 

1396 The unity of the Mystical Body: the Eucharist makes the Church. 
Those who receive the Eucharist are united more closely to Christ. 
Through it Christ unites them to all the faithful in one body - the 
Church. Communion renews, strengthens, and deepens this 
incorporation into the Church, already achieved by Baptism. In 
Baptism we have been called to form but one body.230 The Eucharist 
fulfills this call: "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a 
participation in the blood of Christ? the bread which we break, is it not 
a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we 
who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread:"231 

If you are the body and members of Christ, then it is your sacrament 
that is placed on the table of the Lord; it is your sacrament that you 
receive. To that which you are you respond "Amen" ("yes, it is true!") 
and by responding to it you assent to it. For you hear the words, "the 
Body of Christ" and respond "Amen." Be then a member of the Body 
of Christ that your Amen may be true.232 

1397 The Eucharist commits us to the poor. To receive in truth the 
Body and Blood of Christ given up for us, we must recognize Christ in 
the poorest, his brethren: 

You have tasted the Blood of the Lord, yet you do not recognize your 
brother,.... You dishonor this table when you do not judge worthy of 
sharing your food someone judged worthy to take part in this meal.... 
God freed you from all your sins and invited you here, but you have 
not become more merciful.233 

1398 The Eucharist and the unity of Christians. Before the greatness of 
this mystery St. Augustine exclaims, "O sacrament of devotion! O sign 
of unity! O bond of charity!"234 The more painful the experience of 
the divisions in the Church which break the common participation in 
the table of the Lord, the more urgent are our prayers to the Lord that 
the time of complete unity among all who believe in him may return. 

1399 The Eastern churches that are not in full communion with the 
Catholic Church celebrate the Eucharist with great love. "These 
Churches, although separated from us, yet possess true sacraments, 



above all - by apostolic succession - the priesthood and the Eucharist, 
whereby they are still joined to us in closest intimacy." A certain 
communion in sacris, and so in the Eucharist, "given suitable 
circumstances and the approval of Church authority, is not merely 
possible but is encouraged."235 

1400 Ecclesial communities derived from the Reformation and 
separated from the Catholic Church, "have not preserved the proper 
reality of the Eucharistic mystery in its fullness, especially because of 
the absence of the sacrament of Holy Orders."236 It is for this reason 
that, for the Catholic Church, Eucharistic intercommunion with these 
communities is not possible. However these ecclesial communities, 
"when they commemorate the Lord's death and resurrection in the 
Holy Supper . . . profess that it signifies life in communion with Christ 
and await his coming in glory."237 

1401 When, in the Ordinary's judgment, a grave necessity arises, 
Catholic ministers may give the sacraments of Eucharist, Penance, and 
Anointing of the Sick to other Christians not in full communion with 
the Catholic Church, who ask for them of their own will, provided they 
give evidence of holding the Catholic faith regarding these sacraments 
and possess the required dispositions.238

VII. The Eucharist - "Pledge of the Glory To Come" 

1402 In an ancient prayer the Church acclaims the mystery of the 
Eucharist: "O sacred banquet in which Christ is received as food, the 
memory of his Passion is renewed, the soul is filled with grace and a 
pledge of the life to come is given to us." If the Eucharist is the 
memorial of the Passover of the Lord Jesus, if by our communion at 
the altar we are filled "with every heavenly blessing and grace,"239 
then the Eucharist is also an anticipation of the heavenly glory. 

1403 At the Last Supper the Lord himself directed his disciples' 
attention toward the fulfillment of the Passover in the kingdom of God: 
"I tell you I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day 
when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."240 Whenever 
the Church celebrates the Eucharist she remembers this promise and 
turns her gaze "to him who is to come." In her prayer she calls for his 
coming: "Marana tha!" "Come, Lord Jesus!"241 "May your grace come 
and this world pass away!"242 

1404 The Church knows that the Lord comes even now in his 
Eucharist and that he is there in our midst. However, his presence is 
veiled. Therefore we celebrate the Eucharist "awaiting the blessed hope 
and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ,"243 asking "to share in 
your glory when every tear will be wiped away. On that day we shall see 
you, our God, as you are. We shall become like you and praise you for 
ever through Christ our Lord."244 

1405 There is no surer pledge or dearer sign of this great hope in the 
new heavens and new earth "in which righteousness dwells,"245 than 
the Eucharist. Every time this mystery is celebrated, "the work of our 
redemption is carried on" and we "break the one bread that provides 
the medicine of immortality, the antidote for death, and the food that 
makes us live for ever in Jesus Christ."246

Article 3 THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST 

 

 

IN BRIEF 



1406 Jesus said: "I am the living bread that came down from heaven; if 
any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; . . . he who eats my flesh 
and drinks my blood has eternal life and . . . abides in me, and I in 
him" (? Jn 6:51, ? 54, ? 56). 

1407 The Eucharist is the heart and the summit of the Church's life, 
for in it Christ associates his Church and all her members with his 
sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving offered once for all on the cross to 
his Father; by this sacrifice he pours out the graces of salvation on his 
Body which is the Church. 

1408 The Eucharistic celebration always includes: the proclamation of 
the Word of God; thanksgiving to God the Father for all his benefits, 
above all the gift of his Son; the consecration of bread and wine; and 
participation in the liturgical banquet by receiving the Lord's body and 
blood. These elements constitute one single act of worship. 

1409 The Eucharist is the memorial of Christ's Passover, that is, of the 
work of salvation accomplished by the life, death, and resurrection of 
Christ, a work made present by the liturgical action. 

1410 It is Christ himself, the eternal high priest of the New Covenant 
who, acting through the ministry of the priests, offers the Eucharistic 
sacrifice. and it is the same Christ, really present under the species of 
bread and wine, who is the offering of the Eucharistic sacrifice. 

1411 Only validly ordained priests can preside at the Eucharist and 
consecrate the bread and the wine so that they become the Body and 
Blood of the Lord. 

1412 The essential signs of the Eucharistic sacrament are wheat bread 
and grape wine, on which the blessing of the Holy Spirit is invoked and 
the priest pronounces the words of consecration spoken by Jesus 
during the Last Supper: "This is my body which will be given up for 
you.... This is the cup of my blood...." 

1413 By the consecration the transubstantiation of the bread and wine 
into the Body and Blood of Christ is brought about. Under the 
consecrated species of bread and wine Christ himself, living and 
glorious, is present in a true, real, and substantial manner: his Body 



and his Blood, with his soul and his divinity (cf. Council of Trent: DS 
1640; 1651). 

1414 As sacrifice, the Eucharist is also offered in reparation for the sins 
of the living and the dead and to obtain spiritual or temporal benefits 
from God. 

1415 Anyone who desires to receive Christ in Eucharistic communion 
must be in the state of grace. Anyone aware of having sinned mortally 
must not receive communion without having received absolution in the 
sacrament of penance. 

1416 Communion with the Body and Blood of Christ increases the 
communicant's union with the Lord, forgives his venial sins, and 
preserves him from grave sins. Since receiving this sacrament 
strengthens the bonds of charity between the communicant and Christ, 
it also reinforces the unity of the Church as the Mystical Body of 
Christ. 

1417 The Church warmly recommends that the faithful receive Holy 
Communion when they participate in the celebration of the Eucharist; 
she obliges them to do so at least once a year. 

1418 Because Christ himself is present in the sacrament of the altar, he 
is to be honored with the worship of adoration. "To visit the Blessed 
Sacrament is . . . a proof of gratitude, an expression of love, and a duty 
of adoration toward Christ our Lord" (Paul VI, MF 66). 

1419 Having passed from this world to the Father, Christ gives us in 
the Eucharist the pledge of glory with him. Participation in the Holy 
Sacrifice identifies us with his Heart, sustains our strength along the 
pilgrimage of this life, makes us long for eternal life, and unites us even 
now to the Church in heaven, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the 
saints

CHAPTER TWO THE SACRAMENTS OF HEALING 

1420 Through the sacraments of Christian initiation, man receives the 
new life of Christ. Now we carry this life "in earthen vessels," and it 
remains "hidden with Christ in God."1 We are still in our "earthly 
tent," subject to suffering, illness, and death.2 This new life as a child 
of God can be weakened and even lost by sin. 

1421 The Lord Jesus Christ, physician of our souls and bodies, who 
forgave the sins of the paralytic and restored him to bodily health,3 has 
willed that his Church continue, in the power of the Holy Spirit, his 
work of healing and salvation, even among her own members. This is 
the purpose of the two sacraments of healing: the sacrament of 
Penance and the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick.

I. What is This Sacrament Called? 

1423 It is called the sacrament of conversion because it makes 
sacramentally present Jesus' call to conversion, the first step in 
returning to the Father5 from whom one has strayed by sin.  

It is called the sacrament of Penance, since it consecrates the Christian 
sinner's personal and ecclesial steps of conversion, penance, and 
satisfaction. 

1424 It is called the sacrament of confession, since the disclosure or 
confession of sins to a priest is an essential element of this sacrament. 
In a profound sense it is also a "confession" - acknowledgment and 
praise - of the holiness of God and of his mercy toward sinful man.  

It is called the sacrament of forgiveness, since by the priest's 
sacramental absolution God grants the penitent "pardon and peace."6  

It is called the sacrament of Reconciliation, because it imparts to the 
sinner the live of God who reconciles: "Be reconciled to God."7 He 
who lives by God's merciful love is ready to respond to the Lord's call: 
"Go; first be reconciled to your brother."8

II. Why a Sacrament of Reconciliation after Baptism? 

1425 "YOU were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God."9 One 
must appreciate the magnitude of the gift God has given us in the 
sacraments of Christian initiation in order to grasp the degree to which 
sin is excluded for him who has "put on Christ."10 But the apostle 
John also says: "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the 
truth is not in us."11 and the Lord himself taught us to pray: "Forgive 
us our trespasses,"12 linking our forgiveness of one another's offenses 
to the forgiveness of our sins that God will grant us. 

1426 Conversion to Christ, the new birth of Baptism, the gift of the 
Holy Spirit and the Body and Blood of Christ received as food have 
made us "holy and without blemish," just as the Church herself, the 
Bride of Christ, is "holy and without blemish."13 Nevertheless the new 
life received in Christian initiation has not abolished the frailty and 
weakness of human nature, nor the inclination to sin that tradition calls 
concupiscence, which remains in the baptized such that with the help 



of the grace of Christ they may prove themselves in the struggle of 
Christian life.14 This is the struggle of conversion directed toward 
holiness and eternal life to which the Lord never ceases to call us.15

III. The Conversion of the Baptized 

1427 Jesus calls to conversion. This call is an essential part of the 
proclamation of the kingdom: "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom 
of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel."16 In the Church's 
preaching this call is addressed first to those who do not yet know 
Christ and his Gospel. Also, Baptism is the principal place for the first 
and fundamental conversion. It is by faith in the Gospel and by 
Baptism17 that one renounces evil and gains salvation, that is, the 
forgiveness of all sins and the gift of new life. 

1428 Christ's call to conversion continues to resound in the lives of 
Christians. This second conversion is an uninterrupted task for the 
whole Church who, "clasping sinners to her bosom, (is) at once holy 
and always in need of purification, (and) follows constantly the path of 
penance and renewal."18 This endeavor of conversion is not just a 
human work. It is the movement of a "contrite heart," drawn and 
moved by grace to respond to the merciful love of God who loved us 
first.19 

1429 St. Peter's conversion after he had denied his master three times 
bears witness to this. Jesus' look of infinite mercy drew tears of 
repentance from Peter and, after the Lord's resurrection, a threefold 
affirmation of love for him.20 The second conversion also has a 
communitarian dimension, as is clear in the Lord's call to a whole 
Church: "Repent!"21 

St. Ambrose says of the two conversions that, in the Church, "there are 
water and tears: the water of Baptism and the tears of repentance."22

IV. Interior Penance 

1430 Jesus' call to conversion and penance, like that of the prophets 
before him, does not aim first at outward works, "sackcloth and ashes," 
fasting and mortification, but at the conversion of the heart, interior 
conversion. Without this, such penances remain sterile and false; 
however, interior conversion urges expression in visible signs, gestures 
and works of penance.23 

1431 Interior repentance is a radical reorientation of our whole life, a 
return, a conversion to God with all our heart, an end of sin, a turning 
away from evil, with repugnance toward the evil actions we have 
committed. At the same time it entails the desire and resolution to 
change one's life, with hope in God's mercy and trust in the help of his 
grace. This conversion of heart is accompanied by a salutary pain and 



sadness which the Fathers called animi cruciatus (affliction of spirit) 
and compunctio cordis (repentance of heart).24 

1432 The human heart is heavy and hardened. God must give man a 
new heart.25 Conversion is first of all a work of the grace of God who 
makes our hearts return to him: "Restore us to thyself, O LORD, that 
we may be restored!"26 God gives us the strength to begin anew. It is 
in discovering the greatness of God's love that our heart is shaken by 
the horror and weight of sin and begins to fear offending God by sin 
and being separated from him. the human heart is converted by 
looking upon him whom our sins have pierced:27 

Let us fix our eyes on Christ's blood and understand how precious it is 
to his Father, for, poured out for our salvation it has brought to the 
whole world the grace of repentance. 

1433 Since Easter, the Holy Spirit has proved "the world wrong about 
sin,"29 i.e., proved that the world has not believed in him whom the 
Father has sent. But this same Spirit who brings sin to light is also the 
Consoler who gives the human heart grace for repentance and 
conversion.30

V. The Many Forms of Penance in Christian Life 

1434 The interior penance of the Christian can be expressed in many 
and various ways. Scripture and the Fathers insist above all on three 
forms, fasting, prayer, and almsgiving,31 which express conversion in 
relation to oneself, to God, and to others. Alongside the radical 
purification brought about by Baptism or martyrdom they cite as 
means of obtaining forgiveness of sins: effort at reconciliation with 
one's neighbor, tears of repentance, concern for the salvation of one's 
neighbor, the intercession of the saints, and the practice of charity 
"which covers a multitude of sins."32 

1435 Conversion is accomplished in daily life by gestures of 
reconciliation, concern for the poor, the exercise and defense of justice 
and right,33 by the admission of faults to one's brethren, fraternal 
correction, revision of life, examination of conscience, spiritual 
direction, acceptance of suffering, endurance of persecution for the 
sake of righteousness. Taking up one's cross each day and following 
Jesus is the surest way of penance.34 

1436 Eucharist and Penance. Daily conversion and penance find their 
source and nourishment in the Eucharist, for in it is made present the 
sacrifice of Christ which has reconciled us with God. Through the 
Eucharist those who live from the life of Christ are fed and 



strengthened. "It is a remedy to free us from our daily faults and to 
preserve us from mortal sins."35 

1437 Reading Sacred Scripture, praying the Liturgy of the Hours and 
the Our Father - every sincere act of worship or devotion revives the 
spirit of conversion and repentance within us and contributes to the 
forgiveness of our sins. 

1438 The seasons and days of penance in the course of the liturgical 
year (Lent, and each Friday in memory of the death of the Lord) are 
intense moments of the Church's penitential practice.36 These times 
are particularly appropriate for spiritual exercises, penitential liturgies, 
pilgrimages as signs of penance, voluntary self-denial such as fasting 
and almsgiving, and fraternal sharing (charitable and missionary 
works). 

1439 The process of conversion and repentance was described by Jesus 
in the parable of the prodigal son, the center of which is the merciful 
father:37 The fascination of illusory freedom, the abandonment of the 
father's house; the extreme misery in which the son finds himself after 
squandering his fortune; his deep humiliation at finding himself 
obliged to feed swine, and still worse, at wanting to feed on the husks 
the pigs ate; his reflection on all he has lost; his repentance and 
decision to declare himself guilty before his father; the journey back; 
the father's generous welcome; the father's joy - all these are 
characteristic of the process of conversion. the beautiful robe, the ring, 
and the festive banquet are symbols of that new life - pure worthy, and 
joyful - of anyone who returns to God and to the bosom of his family, 
which is the Church. Only the heart of Christ Who knows the depths 
of his Father's love could reveal to us the abyss of his mercy in so 
simple and beautiful a way.

Article 4 THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE AND 
RECONCILIATION 

 

 

VI. The Sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation 

1440 Sin is before all else an offense against God, a rupture of 
communion with him. At the same time it damages communion with 
the Church. For this reason conversion entails both God's forgiveness 
and reconciliation with the Church, which are expressed and 
accomplished liturgically by the sacrament of Penance and 
Reconciliation.38 

Only God forgives sin 

1441 Only God forgives sins.39 Since he is the Son of God, Jesus says 
of himself, "The Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins" and 
exercises this divine power: "Your sins are forgiven."40 Further, by 



virtue of his divine authority he gives this power to men to exercise in 
his name.41 

1442 Christ has willed that in her prayer and life and action his whole 
Church should be the sign and instrument of the forgiveness and 
reconciliation that he acquired for us at the price of his blood. But he 
entrusted the exercise of the power of absolution to the apostolic 
ministry which he charged with the "ministry of reconciliation."42 The 
apostle is sent out "on behalf of Christ" with "God making his appeal" 
through him and pleading: "Be reconciled to God."43 

Reconciliation with the Church 

1443 During his public life Jesus not only forgave sins, but also made 
plain the effect of this forgiveness: he reintegrated forgiven sinners into 
the community of the People of God from which sin had alienated or 
even excluded them. A remarkable sign of this is the fact that Jesus 
receives sinners at his table, a gesture that expresses in an astonishing 
way both God's forgiveness and the return to the bosom of the People 
of God.44 

1444 In imparting to his apostles his own power to forgive sins the 
Lord also gives them the authority to reconcile sinners with the 
Church. This ecclesial dimension of their task is expressed most 
notably in Christ's solemn words to Simon Peter: "I will give you the 
keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall 
be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in 
heaven."45 "The office of binding and loosing which was given to Peter 
was also assigned to the college of the apostles united to its head."46 

1445 The words bind and loose mean: whomever you exclude from 
your communion, will be excluded from communion with God; 
whomever you receive anew into your communion, God will welcome 
back into his. Reconciliation with the Church is inseparable from 
reconciliation with God. 

The sacrament of forgiveness 

1446 Christ instituted the sacrament of Penance for all sinful members 
of his Church: above all for those who, since Baptism, have fallen into 
grave sin, and have thus lost their baptismal grace and wounded 



ecclesial communion. It is to them that the sacrament of Penance 
offers a new possibility to convert and to recover the grace of 
justification. the Fathers of the Church present this sacrament as "the 
second plank [of salvation] after the shipwreck which is the loss of 
grace."47 

1447 Over the centuries the concrete form in which the Church has 
exercised this power received from the Lord has varied considerably. 
During the first centuries the reconciliation of Christians who had 
committed particularly grave sins after their Baptism (for example, 
idolatry, murder, or adultery) was tied to a very rigorous discipline, 
according to which penitents had to do public penance for their sins, 
often for years, before receiving reconciliation. To this "order of 
penitents" (which concerned only certain grave sins), one was only 
rarely admitted and in certain regions only once in a lifetime. During 
the seventh century Irish missionaries, inspired by the Eastern 
monastic tradition, took to continental Europe the "private" practice of 
penance, which does not require public and prolonged completion of 
penitential works before reconciliation with the Church. From that 
time on, the sacrament has been performed in secret between penitent 
and priest. This new practice envisioned the possibility of repetition 
and so opened the way to a regular frequenting of this sacrament. It 
allowed the forgiveness of grave sins and venial sins to be integrated 
into one sacramental celebration. In its main lines this is the form of 
penance that the Church has practiced down to our day. 

1448 Beneath the changes in discipline and celebration that this 
sacrament has undergone over the centuries, the same fundamental 
structure is to be discerned. It comprises two equally essential 
elements: on the one hand, the acts of the man who undergoes 
conversion through the action of the Holy Spirit: namely, contrition, 
confession, and satisfaction; on the other, God's action through the 
intervention of the Church. the Church, who through the bishop and 
his priests forgives sins in the name of Jesus Christ and determines the 
manner of satisfaction, also prays for the sinner and does penance with 
him. Thus the sinner is healed and re-established in ecclesial 
communion. 



1449 The formula of absolution used in the Latin Church expresses 
the essential elements of this sacrament: the Father of mercies is the 
source of all forgiveness. He effects the reconciliation of sinners 
through the Passover of his Son and the gift of his Spirit, through the 
prayer and ministry of the Church: 

God, the Father of mercies, 

through the death and the resurrection of his Son 

has reconciled the world to himself 

and sent the Holy Spirit among us 

for the forgiveness of sins; 

 through the ministry of the Church 

may God give you pardon and peace, 

and I absolve you from your sins in the name of the Father, and of the 
Son and of the Holy Spirit.48

VII. The Acts of the Penitent 

1450 "Penance requires . . . the sinner to endure all things willingly, be 
contrite of heart, confess with the lips, and practice complete humility 
and fruitful satisfaction."49 



Contrition 

1451 Among the penitent's acts contrition occupies first place. 
Contrition is "sorrow of the soul and detestation for the sin committed, 
together with the resolution not to sin again."50 

1452 When it arises from a love by which God is loved above all else, 
contrition is called "perfect" (contrition of charity). Such contrition 
remits venial sins; it also obtains forgiveness of mortal sins if it includes 
the firm resolution to have recourse to sacramental confession as soon 
as possible.51 

1453 The contrition called "imperfect" (or "attrition") is also a gift of 
God, a prompting of the Holy Spirit. It is born of the consideration of 
sin's ugliness or the fear of eternal damnation and the other penalties 
threatening the sinner (contrition of fear). Such a stirring of conscience 
can initiate an interior process which, under the prompting of grace, 
will be brought to completion by sacramental absolution. By itself 
however, imperfect contrition cannot obtain the forgiveness of grave 
sins, but it disposes one to obtain forgiveness in the sacrament of 
Penance.52 

1454 The reception of this sacrament ought to be prepared for by an 
examination of conscience made in the light of the Word of God. The 
passages best suited to this can be found in the Ten Commandments, 
moral catechesis of the Gospels and the apostolic Letters, such as the 
Sermon on the Mount and the apostolic teachings.53 

The confession of sins 

1455 The confession (or disclosure) of sins, even from a simply human 
point of view, frees us and facilitates our reconciliation with others. 
Through such an admission man looks squarely at the sins he is guilty 
of, takes responsibility for them, and thereby opens himself again to 
God and to the communion of the Church in order to make a new 
future possible. 

1456 Confession to a priest is an essential part of the sacrament of 
Penance: "All mortal sins of which penitents after a diligent self-
examination are conscious must be recounted by them in confession, 
even if they are most secret and have been committed against the last 



two precepts of the Decalogue; for these sins sometimes wound the 
soul more grievously and are more dangerous than those which are 
committed openly."54 

When Christ's faithful strive to confess all the sins that they can 
remember, they undoubtedly place all of them before the divine mercy 
for pardon. But those who fail to do so and knowingly withhold some, 
place nothing before the divine goodness for remission through the 
mediation of the priest, "for if the sick person is too ashamed to show 
his wound to the doctor, the medicine cannot heal what it does not 
know."55 

1457 According to the Church's command, "after having attained the 
age of discretion, each of the faithful is bound by an obligation 
faithfully to confess serious sins at least once a year."56 Anyone who is 
aware of having committed a mortal sin must not receive Holy 
Communion, even if he experiences deep contrition, without having 
first received sacramental absolution, unless he has a grave reason for 
receiving Communion and there is no possibility of going to 
confession.57 Children must go to the sacrament of Penance before 
receiving Holy Communion for the first time.58 

1458 Without being strictly necessary, confession of everyday faults 
(venial sins) is nevertheless strongly recommended by the Church.59 
Indeed the regular confession of our venial sins helps us form our 
conscience, fight against evil tendencies, let ourselves be healed by 
Christ and progress in the life of the Spirit. By receiving more 
frequently through this sacrament the gift of the Father's mercy, we are 
spurred to be merciful as he is merciful:60 

Whoever confesses his sins . . . is already working with God. God 
indicts your sins; if you also indict them, you are joined with God. Man 
and sinner are, so to speak, two realities: when you hear "man" - this is 
what God has made; when you hear "sinner" - this is what man himself 
has made. Destroy what you have made, so that God may save what he 
has made .... When you begin to abhor what you have made, it is then 
that your good works are beginning, since you are accusing yourself of 
your evil works. the beginning of good works is the confession of evil 
works. You do the truth and come to the light.61 



Satisfaction 

1459 Many sins wrong our neighbor. One must do what is possible in 
order to repair the harm (e.g., return stolen goods, restore the 
reputation of someone slandered, pay compensation for injuries). 
Simple justice requires as much. But sin also injures and weakens the 
sinner himself, as well as his relationships with God and neighbor. 
Absolution takes away sin, but it does not remedy all the disorders sin 
has caused.62 Raised up from sin, the sinner must still recover his full 
spiritual health by doing something more to make amends for the sin: 
he must "make satisfaction for" or "expiate" his sins. This satisfaction is 
also called "penance." 

1460 The penance the confessor imposes must take into account the 
penitent's personal situation and must seek his spiritual good. It must 
correspond as far as possible with the gravity and nature of the sins 
committed. It can consist of prayer, an offering, works of mercy, 
service of neighbor, voluntary self-denial, sacrifices, and above all the 
patient acceptance of the cross we must bear. Such penances help 
configure us to Christ, who alone expiated our sins once for all. They 
allow us to become co-heirs with the risen Christ, "provided we suffer 
with him."63 

The satisfaction that we make for our sins, however, is not so much 
ours as though it were not done through Jesus Christ. We who can do 
nothing ourselves, as if just by ourselves, can do all things with the 
cooperation of "him who strengthens" us. Thus man has nothing of 
which to boast, but all our boasting is in Christ . . . in whom we make 
satisfaction by bringing forth "fruits that befit repentance." These fruits 
have their efficacy from him, by him they are offered to the Father, and 
through him they are accepted by the Father.64

VIII. The Minister of This Sacrament 

1461 Since Christ entrusted to his apostles the ministry of 
reconciliation,65 bishops who are their successors, and priests, the 
bishops' collaborators, continue to exercise this ministry. Indeed 



bishops and priests, by virtue of the sacrament of Holy Orders, have 
the power to forgive all sins "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, 
and of the Holy Spirit." 

1462 Forgiveness of sins brings reconciliation with God, but also with 
the Church. Since ancient times the bishop, visible head of a particular 
Church, has thus rightfully been considered to be the one who 
principally has the power and ministry of reconciliation: he is the 
moderator of the penitential discipline.66 Priests, his collaborators, 
exercise it to the extent that they have received the commission either 
from their bishop (or religious superior) or the Pope, according to the 
law of the Church.67 

1463 Certain particularly grave sins incur excommunication, the most 
severe ecclesiastical penalty, which impedes the reception of the 
sacraments and the exercise of certain ecclesiastical acts, and for which 
absolution consequently cannot be granted, according to canon law, 
except by the Pope, the bishop of the place or priests authorized by 
them.68 In danger of death any priest, even if deprived of faculties for 
hearing confessions, can absolve from every sin and 
excommunication.69 

1464 Priests must encourage the faithful to come to the sacrament of 
Penance and must make themselves available to celebrate this 
sacrament each time Christians reasonably ask for it.70 

1465 When he celebrates the sacrament of Penance, the priest is 
fulfilling the ministry of the Good Shepherd who seeks the lost sheep, 
of the Good Samaritan who binds up wounds, of the Father who 
awaits the prodigal son and welcomes him on his return, and of the 
just and impartial judge whose judgment is both just and merciful. the 
priest is the sign and the instrument of God's merciful love for the 
sinner. 

1466 The confessor is not the master of God's forgiveness, but its 
servant. the minister of this sacrament should unite himself to the 
intention and charity of Christ.71 He should have a proven knowledge 
of Christian behavior, experience of human affairs, respect and 
sensitivity toward the one who has fallen; he must love the truth, be 
faithful to the Magisterium of the Church, and lead the penitent with 



patience toward healing and full maturity. He must pray and do 
penance for his penitent, entrusting him to the Lord's mercy. 

1467 Given the delicacy and greatness of this ministry and the respect 
due to persons, the Church declares that every priest who hears 
confessions is bound under very severe penalties to keep absolute 
secrecy regarding the sins that his penitents have confessed to him. He 
can make no use of knowledge that confession gives him about 
penitents' lives.72 This secret, which admits of no exceptions, is called 
the "sacramental seal," because what the penitent has made known to 
the priest remains "sealed" by the sacrament.

IX. The Effects of This Sacrament 

1468 "The whole power of the sacrament of Penance consists in 
restoring us to God's grace and joining us with him in an intimate 
friendship."73 Reconciliation with God is thus the purpose and effect 
of this sacrament. For those who receive the sacrament of Penance 
with contrite heart and religious disposition, reconciliation "is usually 
followed by peace and serenity of conscience with strong spiritual 
consolation."74 Indeed the sacrament of Reconciliation with God 
brings about a true "spiritual resurrection," restoration of the dignity 
and blessings of the life of the children of God, of which the most 
precious is friendship with God.75 

1469 This sacrament reconciles us with the Church. Sin damages or 
even breaks fraternal communion. the sacrament of Penance repairs or 
restores it. In this sense it does not simply heal the one restored to 
ecclesial communion, but has also a revitalizing effect on the life of the 
Church which suffered from the sin of one of her members.76 Re-
established or strengthened in the communion of saints, the sinner is 
made stronger by the exchange of spiritual goods among all the living 
members of the Body of Christ, whether still on pilgrimage or already 
in the heavenly homeland:77 

It must be recalled that . . . this reconciliation with God leads, as it 
were, to other reconciliations, which repair the other breaches caused 
by sin. the forgiven penitent is reconciled with himself in his inmost 
being, where he regains his innermost truth. He is reconciled with his 



brethren whom he has in some way offended and wounded. He is 
reconciled with the Church. He is reconciled with all creation.78 

1470 In this sacrament, the sinner, placing himself before the merciful 
judgment of God, anticipates in a certain way the judgment to which 
he will be subjected at the end of his earthly life. For it is now, in this 
life, that we are offered the choice between life and death, and it is only 
by the road of conversion that we can enter the Kingdom, from which 
one is excluded by grave sin.79 In converting to Christ through 
penance and faith, the sinner passes from death to life and "does not 
come into judgment."80

X. Indulgences 

1471 The doctrine and practice of indulgences in the Church are 
closely linked to the effects of the sacrament of Penance. 

What is an indulgence? 

"An indulgence is a remission before God of the temporal punishment 
due to sins whose guilt has already been forgiven, which the faithful 
Christian who is duly disposed gains under certain prescribed 
conditions through the action of the Church which, as the minister of 
redemption, dispenses and applies with authority the treasury of the 
satisfactions of Christ and the saints."81  

"An indulgence is partial or plenary according as it removes either part 
or all of the temporal punishment due to sin."82 The faithful can gain 
indulgences for themselves or apply them to the dead.82B 

The punishments of sin 

1472 To understand this doctrine and practice of the Church, it is 
necessary to understand that sin has a double consequence. Grave sin 
deprives us of communion with God and therefore makes us incapable 
of eternal life, the privation of which is called the "eternal punishment" 
of sin. On the other hand every sin, even venial, entails an unhealthy 
attachment to creatures, which must be purified either here on earth, 
or after death in the state called Purgatory. This purification frees one 
from what is called the "temporal punishment" of sin. These two 
punishments must not be conceived of as a kind of vengeance inflicted 
by God from without, but as following from the very nature of sin. A 



conversion which proceeds from a fervent charity can attain the 
complete purification of the sinner in such a way that no punishment 
would remain.83 

1473 The forgiveness of sin and restoration of communion with God 
entail the remission of the eternal punishment of sin, but temporal 
punishment of sin remains. While patiently bearing sufferings and trials 
of all kinds and, when the day comes, serenely facing death, the 
Christian must strive to accept this temporal punishment of sin as a 
grace. He should strive by works of mercy and charity, as well as by 
prayer and the various practices of penance, to put off completely the 
"old man" and to put on the "new man."84 

In the Communion of Saints 

1474 The Christian who seeks to purify himself of his sin and to 
become holy with the help of God's grace is not alone. "The life of 
each of God's children is joined in Christ and through Christ in a 
wonderful way to the life of all the other Christian brethren in the 
supernatural unity of the Mystical Body of Christ, as in a single 
mystical person."85 

1475 In the communion of saints, "a perennial link of charity exists 
between the faithful who have already reached their heavenly home, 
those who are expiating their sins in purgatory and those who are still 
pilgrims on earth. between them there is, too, an abundant exchange of 
all good things."86 In this wonderful exchange, the holiness of one 
profits others, well beyond the harm that the sin of one could cause 
others. Thus recourse to the communion of saints lets the contrite 
sinner be more promptly and efficaciously purified of the punishments 
for sin. 

1476 We also call these spiritual goods of the communion of saints the 
Church's treasury, which is "not the sum total of the material goods 
which have accumulated during the course of the centuries. On the 
contrary the 'treasury of the Church' is the infinite value, which can 
never be exhausted, which Christ's merits have before God. They were 
offered so that the whole of mankind could be set free from sin and 
attain communion with the Father. In Christ, the Redeemer himself, 



the satisfactions and merits of his Redemption exist and find their 
effficacy."87 

1477 "This treasury includes as well the prayers and good works of the 
Blessed Virgin Mary. They are truly immense, unfathomable, and even 
pristine in their value before God. In the treasury, too, are the prayers 
and good works of all the saints, all those who have followed in the 
footsteps of Christ the Lord and by his grace have made their lives holy 
and carried out the mission the Father entrusted to them. In this way 
they attained their own salvation and at the same time cooperated in 
saving their brothers in the unity of the Mystical Body."88 

Obtaining indulgence from God through the Church 

1478 An indulgence is obtained through the Church who, by virtue of 
the power of binding and loosing granted her by Christ Jesus, 
intervenes in favor of individual Christians and opens for them the 
treasury of the merits of Christ and the saints to obtain from the 
Father of mercies the remission of the temporal punishments due for 
their sins. Thus the Church does not want simply to come to the aid of 
these Christians, but also to spur them to works of devotion, penance, 
and charity.89 

1479 Since the faithful departed now being purified are also members 
of the same communion of saints, one way we can help them is to 
obtain indulgences for them, so that the temporal punishments due for 
their sins may be remitted.

XI. The Celebration of the Sacrament of Penance 

1480 Like all the sacraments, Penance is a liturgical action. the 
elements of the celebration are ordinarily these: a greeting and blessing 
from the priest, reading the word of God to illuminate the conscience 



and elicit contrition, and an exhortation to repentance; the confession, 
which acknowledges sins and makes them known to the priest; the 
imposition and acceptance of a penance; the priest's absolution; a 
prayer of thanksgiving and praise and dismissal with the blessing of the 
priest. 

1481 The Byzantine Liturgy recognizes several formulas of absolution, 
in the form of invocation, which admirably express the mystery of 
forgiveness: "May the same God, who through the Prophet Nathan 
forgave David when he confessed his sins, who forgave Peter when he 
wept bitterly, the prostitute when she washed his feet with her tears, 
the publican, and the prodigal son, through me, a sinner, forgive you 
both in this life and in the next and enable you to appear before his 
awe-inspiring tribunal without condemnation, he who is blessed for 
ever and ever. Amen." 

1482 The sacrament of Penance can also take place in the framework 
of a communal celebration in which we prepare ourselves together for 
confession and give thanks together for the forgiveness received. Here, 
the personal confession of sins and individual absolution are inserted 
into a liturgy of the word of God with readings and a homily, an 
examination of conscience conducted in common, a communal 
request for forgiveness, the Our Father and a thanksgiving in common. 
This communal celebration expresses more clearly the ecclesial 
character of penance. However, regardless of its manner of celebration 
the sacrament of Penance is always, by its very nature, a liturgical 
action, and therefore an ecclesial and public action.90 

1483 In case of grave necessity recourse may be had to a communal 
celebration of reconciliation with general confession and general 
absolution. Grave necessity of this sort can arise when there is 
imminent danger of death without sufficient time for the priest or 
priests to hear each penitent's confession. Grave necessity can also exist 
when, given the number of penitents, there are not enough confessors 
to hear individual confessions properly in a reasonable time, so that the 
penitents through no fault of their own would be deprived of 
sacramental grace or Holy Communion for a long time. In this case, 
for the absolution to be valid the faithful must have the intention of 
individually confessing their grave sins in the time required.91 The 



diocesan bishop is the judge of whether or not the conditions required 
for general absolution exist.92 A large gathering of the faithful on the 
occasion of major feasts or pilgrimages does not constitute a case of 
grave necessity.93 

1484 "Individual, integral confession and absolution remain the only 
ordinary way for the faithful to reconcile themselves with God and the 
Church, unless physical or moral impossibility excuses from this kind 
of confession."94 There are profound reasons for this. Christ is at work 
in each of the sacraments. He personally addresses every sinner: "My 
son, your sins are forgiven."95 He is the physician tending each one of 
the sick who need him to cure them.96 He raises them up and 
reintegrates them into fraternal communion. Personal confession is 
thus the form most expressive of reconciliation with God and with the 
Church.

Article 4 THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE AND 
RECONCILIATION 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

1485 "On the evening of that day, the first day of the week," Jesus 
showed himself to his apostles. "He breathed on them, and said to 
them: 'Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are 
forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained"' (Jn 20:19, 22-
23). 

1486 The forgiveness of sins committed after Baptism is conferred by a 
particular sacrament called the sacrament of conversion, confession, 
penance, or reconciliation. 

1487 The sinner wounds God's honor and love, his own human dignity 
as a man called to be a son of God, and the spiritual well-being of the 
Church, of which each Christian ought to be a living stone. 

1488 To the eyes of faith no evil is graver than sin and nothing has 
worse consequences for sinners themselves, for the Church, and for the 
whole world. 

1489 To return to communion with God after having lost it through 
sin is a process born of the grace of God who is rich in mercy and 
solicitous for the salvation of men. One must ask for this precious gift 
for oneself and for others. 

1490 The movement of return to God, called conversion and 
repentance, entails sorrow for and abhorrence of sins committed, and 
the firm purpose of sinning no more in the future. Conversion touches 
the past and the future and is nourished by hope in God's mercy. 

1491 The sacrament of Penance is a whole consisting in three actions 
of the penitent and the priest's absolution. the penitent's acts are 



repentance, confession or disclosure of sins to the priest, and the 
intention to make reparation and do works of reparation. 

1492 Repentance (also called contrition) must be inspired by motives 
that arise from faith. If repentance rises from love of charity for God, it 
is called "perfect" contrition; if it is founded on other motives, it is 
called "imperfect." 

1493 One who desires to obtain reconciliation with God and with the 
Church, must confess to a priest all the unconfessed grave sins he 
remembers after having carefully examined his conscience. the 
confession of venial faults, without being necessary in itself, is 
nevertheless strongly recommended by the Church. 

1494 The confessor proposes the performance of certain acts of 
"satisfaction" or "penance" to be performed by the penitent in order to 
repair the harm caused by sin and to re-establish habits befitting a 
disciple of Christ. 

1495 Only priests who have received the faculty of absolving from the 
authority of the Church can forgive sins in the name of Christ. 

1496 The spiritual effects of the sacrament of Penance are:  

- reconciliation with God by which the penitent recovers grace;  

- reconciliation with the Church;  

- remission of the eternal punishment incurred by mortal sins;  

- remission, at least in part, of temporal punishments resulting from 
sin;  

- peace and serenity of conscience, and spiritual consolation;  

- an increase of spiritual strength for the Christian battle. 

1497 Individual and integral confession of grave sins followed by 
absolution remains the only ordinary means of reconciliation with God 
and with the Church. 

1498 Through indulgences the faithful can obtain the remission of 
temporal punishment resulting from sin for themselves and also for the 
souls in Purgatory.

I. Its Foundations in the Economy of Salvation 

Illness in human life 

1500 Illness and suffering have always been among the gravest 
problems confronted in human life. In illness, man experiences his 
powerlessness, his limitations, and his finitude. Every illness can make 
us glimpse death. 

1501 Illness can lead to anguish, self-absorption, sometimes even 
despair and revolt against God. It can also make a person more 
mature, helping him discern in his life what is not essential so that he 
can turn toward that which is. Very often illness provokes a search for 
God and a return to him. 

The sick person before God 

1502 The man of the Old Testament lives his sickness in the presence 
of God. It is before God that he laments his illness, and it is of God, 
Master of life and death, that he implores healing.98 Illness becomes a 
way to conversion; God's forgiveness initiates the healing.99 It is the 
experience of Israel that illness is mysteriously linked to sin and evil, 
and that faithfulness to God according to his law restores life: "For I 
am the Lord, your healer."100 The prophet intuits that suffering can 
also have a redemptive meaning for the sins of others.101 Finally 
Isaiah announces that God will usher in a time for Zion when he will 
pardon every offense and heal every illness.102 

Christ the physician 

1503 Christ's compassion toward the sick and his many healings of 
every kind of infirmity are a resplendent sign that "God has visited his 
people"103 and that the Kingdom of God is close at hand. Jesus has 



the power not only to heal, but also to forgive sins;104 he has come to 
heal the whole man, soul and body; he is the physician the sick have 
need of.105 His compassion toward all who suffer goes so far that he 
identifies himself with them: "I was sick and you visited me."106 His 
preferential love for the sick has not ceased through the centuries to 
draw the very special attention of Christians toward all those who 
suffer in body and soul. It is the source of tireless efforts to comfort 
them. 

1504 Often Jesus asks the sick to believe.107 He makes use of signs to 
heal: spittle and the laying on of hands,108 mud and washing.109 The 
sick try to touch him, "for power came forth from him and healed 
them all."110 and so in the sacraments Christ continues to "touch" us 
in order to heal us. 

1505 Moved by so much suffering Christ not only allows himself to be 
touched by the sick, but he makes their miseries his own: "He took our 
infirmities and bore our diseases."111 But he did not heal all the sick. 
His healings were signs of the coming of the Kingdom of God. They 
announced a more radical healing: the victory over sin and death 
through his Passover. On the cross Christ took upon himself the whole 
weight of evil and took away the "sin of the world,"112 of which illness 
is only a consequence. By his passion and death on the cross Christ has 
given a new meaning to suffering: it can henceforth configure us to 
him and unite us with his redemptive Passion. 

"Heal the sick . . ." 

1506 Christ invites his disciples to follow him by taking up their cross 
in their turn.113 By following him they acquire a new outlook on 
illness and the sick. Jesus associates them with his own life of poverty 
and service. He makes them share in his ministry of compassion and 
healing: "So they went out and preached that men should repent. and 
they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick 
and healed them."114 

1507 The risen Lord renews this mission ("In my name . . . they will 
lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover."115) and confirms it 
through the signs that the Church performs by invoking his name.116 



These signs demonstrate in a special way that Jesus is truly "God who 
saves."117 

1508 The Holy Spirit gives to some a special charism of healing118 so 
as to make manifest the power of the grace of the risen Lord. But even 
the most intense prayers do not always obtain the healing of all 
illnesses. Thus St. Paul must learn from the Lord that "my grace is 
sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness," and that 
the sufferings to be endured can mean that "in my flesh I complete 
what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his Body, that is, 
the Church."119 

1509 "Heal the sick!"120 The Church has received this charge from 
the Lord and strives to carry it out by taking care of the sick as well as 
by accompanying them with her prayer of intercession. She believes in 
the life-giving presence of Christ, the physician of souls and bodies. 
This presence is particularly active through the sacraments, and in an 
altogether special way through the Eucharist, the bread that gives 
eternal life and that St. Paul suggests is connected with bodily 
health.121 

1510 However, the apostolic Church has its own rite for the sick, 
attested to by St. James: "Is any among you sick? Let him call for the 
elders [presbyters] of the Church and let them pray over him, 
anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith 
will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has 
committed sins, he will be forgiven."122 Tradition has recognized in 
this rite one of the seven sacraments.123 

A sacrament of the sick 

1511 The Church believes and confesses that among the seven 
sacraments there is one especially intended to strengthen those who 
are being tried by illness, the Anointing of the Sick: 

This sacred anointing of the sick was instituted by Christ our Lord as a 
true and proper sacrament of the New Testament. It is alluded to 
indeed by Mark, but is recommended to the faithful and promulgated 
by James the apostle and brother of the Lord.124 



1512 From ancient times in the liturgical traditions of both East and 
West, we have testimonies to the practice of anointings of the sick with 
blessed oil. Over the centuries the Anointing of the Sick was conferred 
more and more exclusively on those at the point of death. Because of 
this it received the name "Extreme Unction." Notwithstanding this 
evolution the liturgy has never failed to beg the Lord that the sick 
person may recover his health if it would be conducive to his 
salvation.125 

1513 The Apostolic Constitution Sacram unctionem infirmorum,126 
following upon the Second Vatican Council,127 established that 
henceforth, in the Roman Rite, the following be observed: 

The sacrament of Anointing of the Sick is given to those who are 
seriously ill by anointing them on the forehead and hands with duly 
blessed oil - pressed from olives or from other plants - saying, only 
once: "Through this holy anointing may the Lord in his love and mercy 
help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit. May the Lord who frees you 
from sin save you and raise you up."128

II. Who Receives and Who Administers This Sacrament? 

In case of grave illness . . . 

1514 The Anointing of the Sick "is not a sacrament for those only who 
are at the point of death. Hence, as soon as anyone of the faithful 
begins to be in danger of death from sickness or old age, the fitting 
time for him to receive this sacrament has certainly already 
arrived."129 

1515 If a sick person who received this anointing recovers his health, 
he can in the case of another grave illness receive this sacrament again. 
If during the same illness the person's condition becomes more serious, 
the sacrament may be repeated. It is fitting to receive the Anointing of 
the Sick just prior to a serious operation. the same holds for the elderly 
whose frailty becomes more pronounced. 

" . . . let him call for the presbyters of the Church" 

1516 Only priests (bishops and presbyters) are ministers of the 
Anointing of the Sick.130 It is the duty of pastors to instruct the 
faithful on the benefits of this sacrament. the faithful should encourage 
the sick to call for a priest to receive this sacrament. the sick should 
prepare themselves to receive it with good dispositions, assisted by 
their pastor and the whole ecclesial community, which is invited to 
surround the sick in a special way through their prayers and fraternal 
attention.

III. How is This Sacrament Celebrated? 

1517 Like all the sacraments the Anointing of the Sick is a liturgical 
and communal celebration,131 whether it takes place in the family 
home, a hospital or church, for a single sick person or a whole group of 
sick persons. It is very fitting to celebrate it within the Eucharist, the 
memorial of the Lord's Passover. If circumstances suggest it, the 
celebration of the sacrament can be preceded by the sacrament of 
Penance and followed by the sacrament of the Eucharist. As the 
sacrament of Christ's Passover the Eucharist should always be the last 
sacrament of the earthly journey, the "viaticum" for "passing over" to 
eternal life. 

1518 Word and sacrament form an indivisible whole. the Liturgy of the 
Word, preceded by an act of repentance, opens the celebration. the 
words of Christ, the witness of the apostles, awaken the faith of the sick 
person and of the community to ask the Lord for the strength of his 
Spirit. 

1519 The celebration of the sacrament includes the following principal 
elements: the "priests of the Church"132 - in silence - lay hands on the 
sick; they pray over them in the faith of the Church133 - this is the 
epiclesis proper to this sacrament; they then anoint them with oil 
blessed, if possible, by the bishop.  

These liturgical actions indicate what grace this sacrament confers 
upon the sick.

IV. The Effects of the Celebration of This Sacrament 

1520 A particular gift of the Holy Spirit. the first grace of this 
sacrament is one of strengthening, peace and courage to overcome the 
difficulties that go with the condition of serious illness or the frailty of 
old age. This grace is a gift of the Holy Spirit, who renews trust and 
faith in God and strengthens against the temptations of the evil one, 
the temptation to discouragement and anguish in the face of death.134 
This assistance from the Lord by the power of his Spirit is meant to 
lead the sick person to healing of the soul, but also of the body if such 
is God's will.135 Furthermore, "if he has committed sins, he will be 
forgiven."136 

1521 Union with the passion of Christ. By the grace of this sacrament 
the sick person receives the strength and the gift of uniting himself 
more closely to Christ's Passion: in a certain way he is consecrated to 
bear fruit by configuration to the Savior's redemptive Passion. 
Suffering, a consequence of original sin, acquires a new meaning; it 
becomes a participation in the saving work of Jesus. 

1522 An ecclesial grace. the sick who receive this sacrament, "by freely 
uniting themselves to the passion and death of Christ," "contribute to 
the good of the People of God."137 By celebrating this sacrament the 
Church, in the communion of saints, intercedes for the benefit of the 
sick person, and he, for his part, though the grace of this sacrament, 
contributes to the sanctification of the Church and to the good of all 
men for whom the Church suffers and offers herself through Christ to 
God the Father. 

1523 A preparation for the final journey. If the sacrament of anointing 
of the sick is given to all who suffer from serious illness and infirmity, 
even more rightly is it given to those at the point of departing this life; 



so it is also called sacramentum exeuntium (the sacrament of those 
departing).138 The Anointing of the Sick completes our conformity to 
the death and Resurrection of Christ, just as Baptism began it. It 
completes the holy anointings that mark the whole Christian life: that 
of Baptism which sealed the new life in us, and that of Confirmation 
which strengthened us for the combat of this life. This last anointing 
fortifies the end of our earthly life like a solid rampart for the final 
struggles before entering the Father's house.139

Article 5 THE ANOINTING OF THE SICK 

 

 

V. Viaticum, the Last Sacrament of the Christian 



1524 In addition to the Anointing of the Sick, the Church offers those 
who are about to leave this life the Eucharist as viaticum. Communion 
in the body and blood of Christ, received at this moment of "passing 
over" to the Father, has a particular significance and importance. It is 
the seed of eternal life and the power of resurrection, according to the 
words of the Lord: "He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has 
eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day."140 The sacrament 
of Christ once dead and now risen, the Eucharist is here the sacrament 
of passing over from death to life, from this world to the Father.141 

1525 Thus, just as the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and the 
Eucharist form a unity called "the sacraments of Christian initiation," 
so too it can be said that Penance, the Anointing of the Sick and the 
Eucharist as viaticum constitute at the end of Christian life "the 
sacraments that prepare for our heavenly homeland" or the sacraments 
that complete the earthly pilgrimage.

IN BRIEF 

1526 "Is any among you sick? Let him call for the presbyters of the 
Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the 
name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and 
the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be 
forgiven" (Jas 5:14-15). 

1527 The sacrament of Anointing of the Sick has as its purpose the 
conferral of a special grace on the Christian experiencing the 
difficulties inherent in the condition of grave illness or old age. 



1528 The proper time for receiving this holy anointing has certainly 
arrived when the believer begins to be in danger of death because of 
illness or old age. 

1529 Each time a Christian falls seriously ill, he may receive the 
Anointing of the Sick, and also when, after he has received it, the 
illness worsens. 

1530 Only priests (presbyters and bishops) can give the sacrament of 
the Anointing of the Sick, using oil blessed by the bishop, or if 
necessary by the celebrating presbyter himself. 

1531 The celebration of the Anointing of the Sick consists essentially 
in the anointing of the forehead and hands of the sick person (in the 
Roman Rite) or of other parts of the body (in the Eastern rite), the 
anointing being accompanied by the liturgical prayer of the celebrant 
asking for the special grace of this sacrament. 

1532 The special grace of the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick 
has as its effects:  

- the uniting of the sick person to the passion of Christ, for his own 
good and that of the whole Church;  

- the strengthening, peace, and courage to endure in a Christian 
manner the sufferings of illness or old age;  

- the forgiveness of sins, if the sick person was not able to obtain it 
through the sacrament of Penance;  

- the restoration of health, if it is conducive to the salvation of his soul;  

- the preparation for passing over to eternal life.

CHAPTER THREE THE SACRAMENTS AT THE SERVICE OF 
COMMUNION 

1533 Baptism, Confirmation, and Eucharist are sacraments of 
Christian initiation. They ground the common vocation of all Christ's 
disciples, a vocation to holiness and to the mission of evangelizing the 
world. They confer the graces needed for the life according to the 
Spirit during this life as pilgrims on the march towards the homeland. 

1534 Two other sacraments, Holy Orders and Matrimony, are directed 
towards the salvation of others; if they contribute as well to personal 
salvation, it is through service to others that they do so. They confer a 
particular mission in the Church and serve to build up the People of 
God. 

1535 Through these sacraments those already consecrated by Baptism 
and Confirmation1 for the common priesthood of all the faithful can 
receive particular consecrations. Those who receive the sacrament of 
Holy Orders are consecrated in Christ's name "to feed the Church by 
the word and grace of God."2 On their part, "Christian spouses are 
fortified and, as it were, consecrated for the duties and dignity of their 
state by a special sacrament."3

ARTICLE 6 THE SACRAMENT OF HOLY ORDERS 

1536 Holy Orders is the sacrament through which the mission 
entrusted by Christ to his apostles continues to be exercised in the 
Church until the end of time: thus it is the sacrament of apostolic

I. Why Is This Sacrament Called "Orders"? 

1537 The word order in Roman antiquity designated an established 
civil body, especially a governing body. Ordinatio means incorporation 
into an ordo. In the Church there are established bodies which 
Tradition, not without a basis in Sacred Scripture,4 has since ancient 
times called taxeis (Greek) or ordines. And so the liturgy speaks of the 
ordo episcoporum, the ordo presbyterorum, the ordo diaconorum. 
Other groups also receive this name of ordo: catechumens, virgins, 
spouses, widows,.... 

1538 Integration into one of these bodies in the Church was 
accomplished by a rite called ordinatio, a religious and liturgical act 
which was a consecration, a blessing or a sacrament. Today the word 
"ordination" is reserved for the sacramental act which integrates a man 
into the order of bishops, presbyters, or deacons, and goes beyond a 
simple election, designation, delegation, or institution by the 



community, for it confers a gift of the Holy Spirit that permits the 
exercise of a "sacred power" (sacra potestas)5 which can come only 
from Christ himself through his Church. Ordination is also called 
consecratio, for it is a setting apart and an investiture by Christ himself 
for his Church. the laying on of hands by the bishop, with the 
consecratory prayer, constitutes the visible sign of this ordination.

II. The Sacrament of Holy Orders in the Economy of Salvation 

The priesthood of the Old Covenant 

1539 The chosen people was constituted by God as "a kingdom of 
priests and a holy nation."6 But within the people of Israel, God chose 
one of the twelve tribes, that of Levi, and set it apart for liturgical 
service; God himself is its inheritance.7 A special rite consecrated the 
beginnings of the priesthood of the Old Covenant. the priests are 
"appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and 
sacrifices for sins."8 

1540 Instituted to proclaim the Word of God and to restore 
communion with God by sacrifices and prayer,9 this priesthood 
nevertheless remains powerless to bring about salvation, needing to 
repeat its sacrifices ceaselessly and being unable to achieve a definitive 
sanctification, which only the sacrifice of Christ would accomplish.10 

1541 The liturgy of the Church, however, sees in the priesthood of 
Aaron and the service of the Levites, as in the institution of the seventy 
elders,11 a prefiguring of the ordained ministry of the New Covenant. 
Thus in the Latin Rite the Church prays in the consecratory preface of 
the ordination of bishops: 



God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

by your gracious word 

you have established the plan of your Church. 

  

From the beginning, 

you chose the descendants of Abraham to be your holy nation. 

You established rulers and priests 

and did not leave your sanctuary without ministers to serve you....12 

1542 At the ordination of priests, the Church prays: 

Lord, holy Father, . . . 

when you had appointed high priests to rule your people, 

you chose other men next to them in rank and dignity 

to be with them and to help them in their task.... 

  

you extended the spirit of Moses to seventy wise men.... 

You shared among the sons of Aaron 

the fullness of their father's power.13 

1543 In the consecratory prayer for ordination of deacons, the Church 
confesses: 

Almighty God . . .. 

You make the Church, Christ's body, 

grow to its full stature as a new and greater temple. 

You enrich it with every kind of grace 

and perfect it with a diversity of members 

to serve the whole body in a wonderful pattern of unity. 

  



You established a threefold ministry of worship and service, 

for the glory of your name. 

As ministers of your tabernacle you chose the sons of Levi 

and gave them your blessing as their everlasting inheritance.14 

The one priesthood of Christ 

1544 Everything that the priesthood of the Old Covenant prefigured 
finds its fulfillment in Christ Jesus, the "one mediator between God 
and men."15 The Christian tradition considers Melchizedek, "priest of 
God Most High," as a prefiguration of the priesthood of Christ, the 
unique "high priest after the order of Melchizedek";16 "holy, 
blameless, unstained,"17 "by a single offering he has perfected for all 
time those who are sanctified,"18 that is, by the unique sacrifice of the 
cross. 

1545 The redemptive sacrifice of Christ is unique, accomplished once 
for all; yet it is made present in the Eucharistic sacrifice of the Church. 
the same is true of the one priesthood of Christ; it is made present 
through the ministerial priesthood without diminishing the uniqueness 
of Christ's priesthood: "Only Christ is the true priest, the others being 
only his ministers."19 

Two participations in the one priesthood of Christ 

1546 Christ, high priest and unique mediator, has made of the Church 
"a kingdom, priests for his God and Father."20 The whole community 
of believers is, as such, priestly. the faithful exercise their baptismal 
priesthood through their participation, each according to his own 
vocation, in Christ's mission as priest, prophet, and king. Through the 
sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation the faithful are "consecrated 
to be . . . a holy priesthood."21 

1547 The ministerial or hierarchical priesthood of bishops and priests, 
and the common priesthood of all the faithful participate, "each in its 
own proper way, in the one priesthood of Christ." While being 
"ordered one to another," they differ essentially.22 In what sense? 
While the common priesthood of the faithful is exercised by the 
unfolding of baptismal grace - a life of faith, hope, and charity, a life 



according to the Spirit - ,the ministerial priesthood is at the service of 
the common priesthood. It is directed at the unfolding of the baptismal 
grace of all Christians. the ministerial priesthood is a means by which 
Christ unceasingly builds up and leads his Church. For this reason it is 
transmitted by its own sacrament, the sacrament of Holy Orders. 
 

In the person of Christ the Head . . . 

1548 In the ecclesial service of the ordained minister, it is Christ 
himself who is present to his Church as Head of his Body, Shepherd of 
his flock, high priest of the redemptive sacrifice, Teacher of Truth. This 
is what the Church means by saying that the priest, by virtue of the 
sacrament of Holy Orders, acts in persona Christi Capitis:23 

It is the same priest, Christ Jesus, whose sacred person his minister 
truly represents. Now the minister, by reason of the sacerdotal 
consecration which he has received, is truly made like to the high priest 
and possesses the authority to act in the power and place of the person 
of Christ himself (virtute ac persona ipsius Christi).24  

Christ is the source of all priesthood: the priest of the old law was a 
figure of Christ, and the priest of the new law acts in the person of 
Christ.25 

1549 Through the ordained ministry, especially that of bishops and 
priests, the presence of Christ as head of the Church is made visible in 
the midst of the community of believers.26 In the beautiful expression 
of St. Ignatius of Antioch, the bishop is typos tou Patros: he is like the 
living image of God the Father.27 

1550 This presence of Christ in the minister is not to be understood as 
if the latter were preserved from all human weaknesses, the spirit of 
domination, error, even sin. the power of the Holy Spirit does not 
guarantee all acts of ministers in the same way. While this guarantee 
extends to the sacraments, so that even the minister's sin cannot 
impede the fruit of grace, in many other acts the minister leaves human 
traces that are not always signs of fidelity to the Gospel and 
consequently can harm the apostolic fruitfulness of the Church. 



1551 This priesthood is ministerial. "That office . . . which the Lord 
committed to the pastors of his people, is in the strict sense of the term 
a service."28 It is entirely related to Christ and to men. It depends 
entirely on Christ and on his unique priesthood; it has been instituted 
for the good of men and the communion of the Church. the sacrament 
of Holy Orders communicates a "sacred power" which is none other 
than that of Christ. the exercise of this authority must therefore be 
measured against the model of Christ, who by love made himself the 
least and the servant of all.29 "The Lord said clearly that concern for 
his flock was proof of love for him."30 

. . . "in the name of the whole Church" 

1552 The ministerial priesthood has the task not only of representing 
Christ - Head of the Church - before the assembly of the faithful, but 
also of acting in the name of the whole Church when presenting to 
God the prayer of the Church, and above all when offering the 
Eucharistic sacrifice.31 

1553 "In the name of the whole Church" does not mean that priests 
are the delegates of the community. the prayer and offering of the 
Church are inseparable from the prayer and offering of Christ, her 
head; it is always the case that Christ worships in and through his 
Church. the whole Church, the Body of Christ, prays and offers herself 
"through him, with him, in him," in the unity of the Holy Spirit, to 
God the Father. the whole Body, caput et membra, prays and offers 
itself, and therefore those who in the Body are especially his ministers 
are called ministers not only of Christ, but also of the Church. It is 
because the ministerial priesthood represents Christ that it can 
represent the Church.

III. The Three Degrees of the Sacrament of Holy Orders 

1554 "The divinely instituted ecclesiastical ministry is exercised in 
different degrees by those who even from ancient times have been 
called bishops, priests, and deacons."32 Catholic doctrine, expressed in 



the liturgy, the Magisterium, and the constant practice of the Church, 
recognizes that there are two degrees of ministerial participation in the 
priesthood of Christ: the episcopacy and the presbyterate . the 
diaconate is intended to help and serve them. For this reason the term 
sacerdos in current usage denotes bishops and priests but not deacons. 
Yet Catholic doctrine teaches that the degrees of priestly participation 
(episcopate and presbyterate) and the degree of service (diaconate) are 
all three conferred by a sacramental act called "ordination," that is, by 
the sacrament of Holy Orders: 

Let everyone revere the deacons as Jesus Christ, the bishop as the 
image of the Father, and the presbyters as the senate of God and the 
assembly of the apostles. For without them one cannot speak of the 
Church.33 

Episcopal ordination - fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders 

1555 "Amongst those various offices which have been exercised in the 
Church from the earliest times the chief place, according to the witness 
of tradition, is held by the function of those who, through their 
appointment to the dignity and responsibility of bishop, and in virtue 
consequently of the unbroken succession going back to the beginning, 
are regarded as transmitters of the apostolic line."34 

1556 To fulfil their exalted mission, "the apostles were endowed by 
Christ with a special outpouring of the Holy Spirit coming upon them, 
and by the imposition of hands they passed on to their auxiliaries the 
gift of the Spirit, which is transmitted down to our day through 
episcopal consecration."35 

1557 The Second Vatican Council "teaches . . . that the fullness of the 
sacrament of Holy Orders is conferred by episcopal consecration, that 
fullness namely which, both in the liturgical tradition of the Church 
and the language of the Fathers of the Church, is called the high 
priesthood, the acme (summa) of the sacred ministry."36 

1558 "Episcopal consecration confers, together with the office of 
sanctifying, also the offices of teaching and ruling.... In fact ... by the 
imposition of hands and through the words of the consecration, the 
grace of the Holy Spirit is given, and a sacred character is impressed in 
such wise that bishops, in an eminent and visible manner, take the 



place of Christ himself, teacher, shepherd, and priest, and act as his 
representative (in Eius persona agant)."37 "By virtue, therefore, of the 
Holy Spirit who has been given to them, bishops have been constituted 
true and authentic teachers of the faith and have been made pontiffs 
and pastors."38 

1559 "One is constituted a member of the episcopal body in virtue of 
the sacramental consecration and by the hierarchical communion with 
the head and members of the college."39 The character and collegial 
nature of the episcopal order are evidenced among other ways by the 
Church's ancient practice which calls for several bishops to participate 
in the consecration of a new bishop.40 In our day, the lawful 
ordination of a bishop requires a special intervention of the Bishop of 
Rome, because he is the supreme visible bond of the communion of 
the particular Churches in the one Church and the guarantor of their 
freedom. 

1560 As Christ's vicar, each bishop has the pastoral care of the 
particular Church entrusted to him, but at the same time he bears 
collegially with all his brothers in the episcopacy the solicitude for all 
the Churches: "Though each bishop is the lawful pastor only of the 
portion of the flock entrusted to his care, as a legitimate successor of 
the apostles he is, by divine institution and precept, responsible with 
the other bishops for the apostolic mission of the Church."41 

1561 The above considerations explain why the Eucharist celebrated 
by the bishop has a quite special significance as an expression of the 
Church gathered around the altar, with the one who represents Christ, 
the Good Shepherd and Head of his Church, presiding.42 

The ordination of priests - co-workers of the bishops 

1562 "Christ, whom the Father hallowed and sent into the world, has, 
through his apostles, made their successors, the bishops namely, 
sharers in his consecration and mission; and these, in their turn, duly 
entrusted in varying degrees various members of the Church with the 
office of their ministry."43 "The function of the bishops' ministry was 
handed over in a subordinate degree to priests so that they might be 
appointed in the order of the priesthood and be co-workers of the 



episcapal order for the proper fulfillment of the apostolic mission that 
had been entrusted to it by Christ."44 

1563 "Because it is joined with the episcopal order the office of priests 
shares in the authority by which Christ himself builds up and sanctifies 
and rules his Body. Hence the priesthood of priests, while 
presupposing the sacraments of initiation, is nevertheless conferred by 
its own particular sacrament. Through that sacrament priests by the 
anointing of the Holy Spirit are signed with a special character and so 
are configured to Christ the priest in such a way that they are able to 
act in the person of Christ the head."45 

1564 "Whilst not having the supreme degree of the pontifical office, 
and notwithstanding the fact that they depend on the bishops in the 
exercise of their own proper power, the priests are for all that 
associated with them by reason of their sacerdotal dignity; and in 
virtue of the sacrament of Holy Orders, after the image of Christ, the 
supreme and eternal priest, they are consecrated in order to preach the 
Gospel and shepherd the faithful as well as to celebrate divine worship 
as true priests of the New Testament."46 

1565 Through the sacrament of Holy Orders priests share in the 
universal dimensions of the mission that Christ entrusted to the 
apostles. the spiritual gift they have received in ordination prepares 
them, not for a limited and restricted mission, "but for the fullest, in 
fact the universal mission of salvation 'to the end of the earth,"'47 
"prepared in spirit to preach the Gospel everywhere."48 

1566 "It is in the Eucharistic cult or in the Eucharistic assembly of the 
faithful (synaxis) that they exercise in a supreme degree their sacred 
office; there, acting in the person of Christ and proclaiming his 
mystery, they unite the votive offerings of the faithful to the sacrifice of 
Christ their head, and in the sacrifice of the Mass they make present 
again and apply, until the coming of the Lord, the unique sacrifice of 
the New Testament, that namely of Christ offering himself once for all 
a spotless victim to the Father."49 From this unique sacrifice their 
whole priestly ministry draws its strength.50 

1567 "The priests, prudent cooperators of the episcopal college and its 
support and instrument, called to the service of the People of God, 



constitute, together with their bishop, a unique sacerdotal college 
(presbyterium) dedicated, it is, true to a variety of distinct duties. In 
each local assembly of the faithful they represent, in a certain sense, 
the bishop, with whom they are associated in all trust and generosity; 
in part they take upon themselves his duties and solicitude and in their 
daily toils discharge them."51 priests can exercise their ministry only in 
dependence on the bishop and in communion with him. the promise of 
obedience they make to the bishop at the moment of ordination and 
the kiss of peace from him at the end of the ordination liturgy mean 
that the bishop considers them his co-workers, his sons, his brothers 
and his friends, and that they in return owe him love and obedience. 

1568 "All priests, who are constituted in the order of priesthood by the 
sacrament of Order, are bound together by an intimate sacramental 
brotherhood, but in a special way they form one priestly body in the 
diocese to which they are attached under their own bishop. . ;"52 The 
unity of the presbyterium finds liturgical expression in the custom of 
the presbyters' imposing hands, after the bishop, during the Ate of 
ordination. 

The ordination of deacons - "in order to serve" 

1569 "At a lower level of the hierarchy are to be found deacons, who 
receive the imposition of hands 'not unto the priesthood, but unto the 
ministry."'53 At an ordination to the diaconate only the bishop lays 
hands on the candidate, thus signifying the deacon's special attachment 
to the bishop in the tasks of his "diakonia."54 

1570 Deacons share in Christ's mission and grace in a special way.55 
The sacrament of Holy Orders marks them with an imprint 
(“character") which cannot be removed and which configures them to 
Christ, who made himself the "deacon" or servant of all.56 Among 
other tasks, it is the task of deacons to assist the bishop and priests in 
the celebration of the divine mysteries, above all the Eucharist, in the 
distribution of Holy Communion, in assisting at and blessing 
marriages, in the proclamation of the Gospel and preaching, in 
presiding over funerals, and in dedicating themselves to the various 
ministries of charity.57 



1571 Since the Second Vatican Council the Latin Church has restored 
the diaconate "as a proper and permanent rank of the hierarchy,"58 
while the Churches of the East had always maintained it. This 
permanent diaconate, which can be conferred on married men, 
constitutes an important enrichment for the Church's mission. Indeed 
it is appropriate and useful that men who carry out a truly diaconal 
ministry in the Church, whether in its liturgical and pastoral life or 
whether in its social and charitable works, should "be strengthened by 
the imposition of hands which has come down from the apostles. They 
would be more closely bound to the altar and their ministry would be 
made more fruitful through the sacramental grace of the diaconate."59

IV. The Celebration of This Sacrament 

1572 Given the importance that the ordination of a bishop, a priest, or 
a deacon has for the life of the particular Church, its celebration calls 
for as many of the faithful as possible to take part. It should take place 
preferably on Sunday, in the cathedral, with solemnity appropriate to 
the occasion. All three ordinations, of the bishop, of the pRiest, and of 
the deacon, follow the same movement. Their proper place is within 
the Eucharistic liturgy. 

1573 The essential rite of the sacrament of Holy Orders for all three 
degrees consists in the bishop's imposition of hands on the head of the 
ordinand and in the bishop's specific consecratory prayer asking God 
for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and his gifts proper to the 
ministry to which the candidate is being ordained.60 



1574 As in all the sacraments additional rites surround the celebration. 
Varying greatly among the different liturgical traditions, these rites 
have in common the expression of the multiple aspects of sacramental 
grace. Thus in the Latin Church, the initial rites - presentation and 
election of the ordinand, instruction by the bishop, examination of the 
candidate, litany of the saints - attest that the choice of the candidate is 
made in keeping with the practice of the Church and prepare for the 
solemn act of consecration, after which several rites syrnbolically 
express and complete the mystery accomplished: for bishop and priest, 
an anointing with holy chrism, a sign of the special anointing of the 
Holy Spirit who makes their ministry fruitful; giving the book of the 
Gospels, the ring, the miter, and the crosier to the bishop as the sign of 
his apostolic mission to proclaim the Word of God, of his fidelity to the 
Church, the bride of Christ, and his office as shepherd of the Lord's 
flock; presentation to the priest of the paten and chalice, "the offering 
of the holy people" which he is called to present to God; giving the 
book of the Gospels to the deacon who has just received the mission to 
proclaim the Gospel of Christ.

V. Who Can Confer This Sacrament? 

1575 Christ himself chose the apostles and gave them a share in his 
mission and authority. Raised to the Father's right hand, he has not 
forsaken his flock but he keeps it under his constant protection 
through the apostles, and guides it still through these same pastors 
who continue his work today.61 Thus, it is Christ whose gift it is that 
some be apostles, others pastors. He continues to act through the 
bishops.62 

1576 Since the sacrament of Holy Orders is the sacrament of the 
apostolic ministry, it is for the bishops as the successors of the apostles 
to hand on the "gift of the Spirit,"63 The "apostolic line."64 Validly 



ordained bishops, i.e., those who are in the line of apostolic succession, 
validly confer the three degrees of the sacrament of Holy Orders.65

VI. Who Can Receive This Sacrament? 

1577 "Only a baptized man (vir) validly receives sacred ordination."66 
The Lord Jesus chose men (viri) to form the college of the twelve 
apostles, and the apostles did the same when they chose collaborators 
to succeed them in their ministry.67 The college of bishops, with 
whom the priests are united in the priesthood, makes the college of the 
twelve an ever-present and ever-active reality until Christ's return. the 
Church recognizes herself to be bound by this choice made by the 
Lord himself. For this reason the ordination of women is not 
possible.68 



1578 No one has a right to receive the sacrament of Holy Orders. 
Indeed no one claims this office for himself; he is called to it by 
God.69 Anyone who thinks he recognizes the signs of God's call to the 
ordained ministry must humbly submit his desire to the authority of 
the Church, who has the responsibility and right to call someone to 
receive orders. Like every grace this sacrament can be received only as 
an unmerited gift. 

1579 All the ordained ministers of the Latin Church, with the 
exception of permanent deacons, are normally chosen from among 
men of faith who live a celibate life and who intend to remain celibate 
"for the sake of the kingdom of heaven."70 Called to consecrate 
themselves with undivided heart to the Lord and to "the affairs of the 
Lord,"71 they give themselves entirely to God and to men. Celibacy is 
a sign of this new life to the service of which the Church's minister is 
consecrated; accepted with a joyous heart celibacy radiantly proclaims 
the Reign of God.72 

1580 In the Eastern Churches a different discipline has been in force 
for many centuries: while bishops are chosen solely from among 
celibates, married men can be ordained as deacons and priests. This 
practice has long been considered legitimate; these priests exercise a 
fruitful ministry within their communities.73 Moreover, priestly 
celibacy is held in great honor in the Eastern Churches and many 
priests have freely chosen it for the sake of the Kingdom of God. In the 
East as in the West a man who has already received the sacrament of 
Holy Orders can no longer marry.

VII. The Effects of the Sacrament of Holy Orders 

The indelible character 

1581 This sacrament configures the recipient to Christ by a special 
grace of the Holy Spirit, so that he may serve as Christ's instrument for 
his Church. By ordination one is enabled to act as a representative of 
Christ, Head of the Church, in his triple office of priest, prophet, and 
king. 



1582 As in the case of Baptism and Confirmation this share in Christ's 
office is granted once for all. the sacrament of Holy Orders, like the 
other two, confers an indelible spiritual character and cannot be 
repeated or conferred temporarily.74 

1583 It is true that someone validly ordained can, for grave reason, be 
discharged from the obligations and functions linked to ordination, or 
can be forbidden to exercise them; but he cannot become a layman 
again in the strict sense,75 because the character imprinted by 
ordination is for ever. The vocation and mission received on the day of 
his ordination mark him permanently. 

1584 Since it is ultimately Christ who acts and effects salvation 
through the ordained minister, the unworthiness of the latter does not 
prevent Christ from acting.76 St. Augustine states this forcefully: 

As for the proud minister, he is to be ranked with the devil. Christ's gift 
is not thereby profaned: what flows through him keeps its purity, and 
what passes through him remains dear and reaches the fertile earth.... 
the spiritual power of the sacrament is indeed comparable to light: 
those to be enlightened receive it in its purity, and if it should pass 
through defiled beings, it is not itself defiled.77 

The grace of the Holy Spirit 

1585 The grace of the Holy Spirit proper to this sacrament is 
configuration to Christ as Priest, Teacher, and Pastor, of whom the 
ordained is made a minister. 

1586 For the bishop, this is first of all a grace of strength (“the 
governing spirit": Prayer of Episcopal Consecration in the Latin 
rite):78 The grace to guide and defend his Church with strength and 
prudence as a father and pastor, with gratuitous love for all and a 
preferential love for the poor, the sick, and the needy. This grace impels 
him to proclaim the Gospel to all, to be the model for his flock, to go 
before it on the way of sanctification by identifying himself in the 
Eucharist with Christ the priest and victim, not fearing to give his life 
for his sheep: 

Father, you know all hearts. 

You have chosen your servant for the office of bishop. 



May he be a shepherd to your holy flock, 

and a high priest blameless in your sight, 

ministering to you night and day; 

may he always gain the blessing of your favor 

and offer the gifts of your holy Church. 

Through the Spirit who gives the grace of high priesthood grant him 
the power 

to forgive sins as you have commanded 

to assign ministries as you have decreed 

and to loose from every bond by the authority which you 

gave to your apostles. May he be pleasing to you by his gentleness and 
purity of heart, 

presenting a fragrant offering to you, 

through Jesus Christ, your Son....79 

1587 The spiritual gift conferred by presbyteral ordination is expressed 
by this prayer of the Byzantine Rite. the bishop, while laying on his 
hand, says among other things: 

Lord, fill with the gift of the Holy Spirit 

him whom you have deigned to raise to the rank of the priesthood, 

that he may be worthy to stand without reproach before your altar 

to proclaim the Gospel of your kingdom, 

to fulfill the ministry of your word of truth, 

to offer you spiritual gifts and sacrifices, 

to renew your people by the bath of rebirth; 

so that he may go out to meet our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, 
your only Son, 

on the day of his second coming, 



and may receive from your vast goodness 

the recompense for a faithful administration of his order.80 

1588 With regard to deacons, "strengthened by sacramental grace they 
are dedicated to the People of God, in conjunction with the bishop and 
his body of priests, in the service (diakonia) of the liturgy, of the 
Gospel, and of works of charity."81 

1589 Before the grandeur of the priestly grace and office, the holy 
doctors felt an urgent call to conversion in order to conform their 
whole lives to him whose sacrament had made them ministers. Thus 
St. Gregory of Nazianzus, as a very young priest, exclaimed: 

We must begin by purifying ourselves before purifying others; we must 
be instructed to be able to instruct, become light to illuminate, draw 
close to God to bring him close to others, be sanctified to sanctify, lead 
by the hand and counsel prudently. I know whose ministers we are, 
where we find ourselves and to where we strive. I know God's greatness 
and man's weakness, but also his potential. [Who then is the priest? He 
is] the defender of truth, who stands with angels, gives glory with 
archangels, causes sacrifices to rise to the altar on high, shares Christ's 
priesthood, refashions creation, restores it in God's image, recreates it 
for the world on high and, even greater, is divinized and divinizes.82  

and the holy Cure of Ars: "The priest continues the work of 
redemption on earth.... If we really understood the priest on earth, we 
would die not of fright but of love.... the Priesthood is the love of the 
heart of Jesus."83

IN BRIEF 

1590 St. Paul said to his disciple Timothy: "I remind you to rekindle 
the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands" 
(2Tim 1:6), and "If any one aspires to the office of bishop, he desires a 
noble task." (1 Tim 3:1) To Titus he said: "This is why I left you in 
Crete, that you amend what was defective, and appoint presbyters in 
every town, as I directed you" (Titus 1:5). 

1591 The whole Church is a priestly people. Through Baptism all the 
faithful share in the priesthood of Christ. This participation is called 
the "common priesthood of the faithful." Based on this common 
priesthood and ordered to its service, there exists another participation 
in the mission of Christ: the ministry conferred by the sacrament of 
Holy Orders, where the task is to serve in the name and in the person 
of Christ the Head in the midst of the community. 

1592 The ministerial priesthood differs in essence from the common 
priesthood of the faithful because it confers a sacred power for the 
service of the faithful. the ordained ministers exercise their service for 
the People of God by teaching (munus docendi), divine worship 
(munus liturgicum) and pastoral governance (munus regendi). 

1593 Since the beginning, the ordained ministry has been conferred 
and exercised in three degrees: that of bishops, that of presbyters, and 
that of deacons. the ministries conferred by ordination are 
irreplaceable for the organic structure of the Church: without the 
bishop, presbyters, and deacons, one cannot speak of the Church (cf 
St. Ignatius of Antioch, Ad Trall. 3,1). 

1594 The bishop receives the fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders, 
which integrates him into the episcopal college and makes him the 
visible head of the particular Church entrusted to him. As successors 
of the apostles and members of the college, the bishops share in the 
apostolic responsibility and mission of the whole Church under the 
authority of the Pope, successor of St. Peter. 

1595 Priests are united with the bishops in sacerdotal dignity and at 
the same time depend on them in the exercise of their pastoral 



functions; they are called to be the bishops' prudent co-workers. They 
form around their bishop the presbyterium which bears responsibility 
with him for the particular Church. They receive from the bishop the 
charge of a parish community or a determinate ecclesial office. 

1596 Deacons are ministers ordained for tasks of service of the 
Church; they do not receive the ministerial priesthood, but ordination 
confers on them important functions in the ministry of the word, 
divine worship, pastoral governance, and the service of charity, tasks 
which they must carry out under the pastoral authority of their bishop. 

1597 The sacrament of Holy Orders is conferred by the laying on of 
hands followed by a solemn prayer of consecration asking God to grant 
the ordinand the graces of the Holy Spirit required for his ministry. 
Ordination imprints an indelible sacramental character. 

1598 The Church confers the sacrament of Holy Orders only on 
baptized men (viri), whose suitability for the exercise of the ministry 
has been duly recognized. Church authority alone has the 
responsibility and right to call someone to receive the sacrament of 
Holy Orders. 

1599 In the Latin Church the sacrament of Holy Orders for the 
presbyterate is normally conferred only on candidates who are ready to 
embrace celibacy freely and who publicly manifest their intention of 
staying celibate for the love of God's kingdom and the service of men. 

1600 It is bishops who confer the sacrament of Holy Orders in the 
three degrees.

Article 7 THE SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY 

 

 

I. Marriage in God's Plan 

1602 Sacred Scripture begins with the creation of man and woman in 
the image and likeness of God and concludes with a vision of "the 
wedding-feast of the Lamb."85 Scripture speaks throughout of 
marriage and its "mystery," its institution and the meaning God has 
given it, its origin and its end, its various realizations throughout the 



history of salvation, the difficulties arising from sin and its renewal "in 
the Lord" in the New Covenant of Christ and the Church.86 

Marriage in the order of creation 

1603 "The intimate community of life and love which constitutes the 
married state has been established by the Creator and endowed by him 
with its own proper laws.... God himself is the author of marriage."87 
The vocation to marriage is written in the very nature of man and 
woman as they came from the hand of the Creator. Marriage is not a 
purely human institution despite the many variations it may have 
undergone through the centuries in different cultures, social structures, 
and spiritual attitudes. These differences should not cause us to forget 
its common and permanent characteristics. Although the dignity of this 
institution is not transparent everywhere with the same clarity,88 some 
sense of the greatness of the matrimonial union exists in all cultures. 
"The well-being of the individual person and of both human and 
Christian society is closely bound up with the healthy state of conjugal 
and family life."89 

1604 God who created man out of love also calls him to love the 
fundamental and innate vocation of every human being. For man is 
created in the image and likeness of God who is himself love.90 Since 
God created him man and woman, their mutual love becomes an 
image of the absolute and unfailing love with which God loves man. It 
is good, very good, in the Creator's eyes. and this love which God 
blesses is intended to be fruitful and to be realized in the common 
work of watching over creation: "and God blessed them, and God said 
to them: 'Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it.'"91 

1605 Holy Scripture affirms that man and woman were created for one 
another: "It is not good that the man should be alone."92 The woman, 
"flesh of his flesh," his equal, his nearest in all things, is given to him by 
God as a "helpmate"; she thus represents God from whom comes our 
help.93 "Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves 
to his wife, and they become one flesh."94 The Lord himself shows 
that this signifies an unbreakable union of their two lives by recalling 
what the plan of the Creator had been "in the beginning": "So they are 
no longer two, but one flesh."95 



Marriage under the regime of sin 

1606 Every man experiences evil around him and within himself. This 
experience makes itself felt in the relationships between man and 
woman. Their union has always been threatened by discord, a spirit of 
domination, infidelity, jealousy, and conflicts that can escalate into 
hatred and separation. This disorder can manifest itself more or less 
acutely, and can be more or less overcome according to the 
circumstances of cultures, eras, and individuals, but it does seem to 
have a universal character. 

1607 According to faith the disorder we notice so painfully does not 
stem from the nature of man and woman, nor from the nature of their 
relations, but from sin. As a break with God, the first sin had for its 
first consequence the rupture of the original communion between man 
and woman. Their relations were distorted by mutual 
recriminations;96 their mutual attraction, the Creator's own gift, 
changed into a relationship of domination and lust;97 and the 
beautiful vocation of man and woman to be fruitful, multiply, and 
subdue the earth was burdened by the pain of childbirth and the toil of 
work.98 

1608 Nevertheless, the order of creation persists, though seriously 
disturbed. To heal the wounds of sin, man and woman need the help of 
the grace that God in his infinite mercy never refuses them.99 Without 
his help man and woman cannot achieve the union of their lives for 
which God created them "in the beginning." 

Marriage under the pedagogy of the Law 

1609 In his mercy God has not forsaken sinful man. the punishments 
consequent upon sin, "pain in childbearing" and toil "in the sweat of 
your brow,"100 also embody remedies that limit the damaging effects 
of sin. After the fall, marriage helps to overcome self-absorption, 
egoism, pursuit of one's own pleasure, and to open oneself to the other, 
to mutual aid and to self-giving. 

1610 Moral conscience concerning the unity and indissolubility of 
marriage developed under the pedagogy of the old law. In the Old 
Testament the polygamy of patriarchs and kings is not yet explicitly 
rejected. Nevertheless, the law given to Moses aims at protecting the 



wife from arbitrary domination by the husband, even though according 
to the Lord's words it still carries traces of man's "hardness of heart" 
which was the reason Moses permitted men to divorce their wives.101 

1611 Seeing God's covenant with Israel in the image of exclusive and 
faithful married love, the prophets prepared the Chosen People's 
conscience for a deepened understanding of the unity and 
indissolubility of marriage.102 The books of Ruth and Tobit bear 
moving witness to an elevated sense of marriage and to the fidelity and 
tenderness of spouses. Tradition has always seen in the Song of 
Solomon a unique expression of human love, insofar as it is a reflection 
of God's love - a love "strong as death" that "many waters cannot 
quench."103 

Marriage in the Lord 

1612 The nuptial covenant between God and his people Israel had 
prepared the way for the new and everlasting covenant in which the 
Son of God, by becoming incarnate and giving his life, has united to 
himself in a certain way all mankind saved by him, thus preparing for 
"the wedding-feast of the Lamb."104 

1613 On the threshold of his public life Jesus performs his first sign - 
at his mother's request - during a wedding feast.105 The Church 
attaches great importance to Jesus' presence at the wedding at Cana. 
She sees in it the confirmation of the goodness of marriage and the 
proclamation that thenceforth marriage will be an efficacious sign of 
Christ's presence. 

1614 In his preaching Jesus unequivocally taught the original meaning 
of the union of man and woman as the Creator willed it from the 
beginning permission given by Moses to divorce one's wife was a 
concession to the hardness of hearts.106 The matrimonial union of 
man and woman is indissoluble: God himself has determined it "what 
therefore God has joined together, let no man put asunder."107 

1615 This unequivocal insistence on the indissolubility of the marriage 
bond may have left some perplexed and could seem to be a demand 
impossible to realize. However, Jesus has not placed on spouses a 
burden impossible to bear, or too heavy - heavier than the Law of 
Moses.108 By coming to restore the original order of creation 



disturbed by sin, he himself gives the strength and grace to live 
marriage in the new dimension of the Reign of God. It is by following 
Christ, renouncing themselves, and taking up their crosses that spouses 
will be able to "receive" the original meaning of marriage and live it 
with the help of Christ.109 This grace of Christian marriage is a fruit 
of Christ's cross, the source of all Christian life. 

1616 This is what the Apostle Paul makes clear when he says: 
"Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave 
himself up for her, that he might sanctify her," adding at once: "'For 
this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his 
wife, and the two shall become one. This is a great mystery, and I mean 
in reference to Christ and the Church."110 

1617 The entire Christian life bears the mark of the spousal love of 
Christ and the Church. Already Baptism, the entry into the People of 
God, is a nuptial mystery; it is so to speak the nuptial bath111 which 
precedes the wedding feast, the Eucharist. Christian marriage in its 
turn becomes an efficacious sign, the sacrament of the covenant of 
Christ and the Church. Since it signifies and communicates grace, 
marriage between baptized persons is a true sacrament of the New 
Covenant.112 

Virginity for the sake of the Kingdom 

1618 Christ is the center of all Christian life. the bond with him takes 
precedence over all other bonds, familial or social.113 From the very 
beginning of the Church there have been men and women who have 
renounced the great good of marriage to follow the Lamb wherever he 
goes, to be intent on the things of the Lord, to seek to please him, and 
to go out to meet the Bridegroom who is coming.114 Christ himself 
has invited certain persons to follow him in this way of life, of which he 
remains the model: 

"For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are 
eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs 
who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of 
heaven. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it."115 

1619 Virginity for the sake of the kingdom of heaven is an unfolding of 
baptismal grace, a powerful sign of the supremacy of the bond with 



Christ and of the ardent expectation of his return, a sign which also 
recalls that marriage is a reality of this present age which is passing 
away.116 

1620 Both the sacrament of Matrimony and virginity for the Kingdom 
of God come from the Lord himself. It is he who gives them meaning 
and grants them the grace which is indispensable for living them out in 
conformity with his will.117 Esteem of virginity for the sake of the 
kingdom118 and the Christian understanding of marriage are 
inseparable, and they reinforce each other: 

Whoever denigrates marriage also diminishes the glory of virginity. 
Whoever praises it makes virginity more admirable and resplendent. 
What appears good only in comparison with evil would not be truly 
good. the most excellent good is something even better than what is 
admitted to be good.119

II. The Celebration of Marriage 

1621 In the Latin Rite the celebration of marriage between two 
Catholic faithful normally takes place during Holy Mass, because of 
the connection of all the sacraments with the Paschal mystery of 
Christ.120 In the Eucharist the memorial of the New Covenant is 
realized, the New Covenant in which Christ has united himself for ever 
to the Church, his beloved bride for whom he gave himself up.121 It is 
therefore fitting that the spouses should seal their consent to give 
themselves to each other through the offering of their own lives by 
uniting it to the offering of Christ for his Church made present in the 
Eucharistic sacrifice, and by receiving the Eucharist so that, 
communicating in the same Body and the same Blood of Christ, they 
may form but "one body" in Christ.122 

1622 "Inasmuch as it is a sacramental action of sanctification, the 
liturgical celebration of marriage . . . must be, per se, valid, worthy, and 
fruitful."123 It is therefore appropriate for the bride and groom to 
prepare themselves for the celebration of their marriage by receiving 
the sacrament of penance. 



1623 According to the Latin tradition, the spouses, as ministers of 
Christ's grace, mutually confer upon each other the sacrament of 
Matrimony by expressing their consent before the Church. In the 
traditions of the Eastern Churches, the priests (bishops or presbyters) 
are witnesses to the mutual consent given by the spouses, 123B but for 
the validity of the sacrament their blessing is also necessary..123T 

1624 The various liturgies abound in prayers of blessing and epiclesis 
asking God's grace and blessing on the new couple, especially the 
bride. In the epiclesis of this sacrament the spouses receive the Holy 
Spirit as the communion of love of Christ and the Church.124 The 
Holy Spirit is the seal of their covenant, the ever available source of 
their love and the strength to renew their fidelity.

III. Matrimonial Consent 

1625 The parties to a marriage covenant are a baptized man and 
woman, free to contract marriage, who freely express their consent; "to 
be free" means:  

- not being under constraint;  

- not impeded by any natural or ecclesiastical law. 

1626 The Church holds the exchange of consent between the spouses 
to be the indispensable element that "makes the marriage."125 If 
consent is lacking there is no marriage. 

1627 The consent consists in a "human act by which the partners 
mutually give themselves to each other": "I take you to be my wife" - "I 
take you to be my husband."126 This consent that binds the spouses to 
each other finds its fulfillment in the two "becoming one flesh."127 

1628 The consent must be an act of the will of each of the contracting 
parties, free of coercion or grave external fear.128 No human power 
can substitute for this consent.129 If this freedom is lacking the 
marriage is invalid. 

1629 For this reason (or for other reasons that render the marriage 
null and void) the Church, after an examination of the situation by the 
competent ecclesiastical tribunal, can declare the nullity of a marriage, 
i.e., that the marriage never existed.130 In this case the contracting 
parties are free to marry, provided the natural obligations of a previous 
union are discharged.131 

1630 The priest (or deacon) who assists at the celebration of a 
marriage receives the consent of the spouses in the name of the 



Church and gives the blessing of the Church. the presence of the 
Church's minister (and also of the witnesses) visibly expresses the fact 
that marriage is an ecclesial reality. 

1631 This is the reason why the Church normally requires that the 
faithful contract marriage according to the ecclesiastical form. Several 
reasons converge to explain this requirement:132  

- Sacramental marriage is a liturgical act. It is therefore appropriate 
that it should be celebrated in the public liturgy of the Church;  

- Marriage introduces one into an ecclesial order, and creates rights 
and duties in the Church between the spouses and towards their 
children; - Since marriage is a state of life in the Church, certainty 
about it is necessary (hence the obligation to have witnesses);  

- the public character of the consent protects the "I do" once given and 
helps the spouses remain faithful to it. 

1632 So that the "I do" of the spouses may be a free and responsible 
act and so that the marriage covenant may have solid and lasting 
human and Christian foundations, preparation for marriage is of prime 
importance. 

The example and teaching given by parents and families remain the 
special form of this preparation.  

The role of pastors and of the Christian community as the "family of 
God" is indispensable for the transmission of the human and Christian 
values of marriage and family,133 and much more so in our era when 
many young people experience broken homes which no longer 
sufficiently assure this initiation: 

 

It is imperative to give suitable and timely instruction to young people, 
above all in the heart of their own families, about the dignity of 
married love, its role and its exercise, so that, having learned the value 
of chastity, they will be able at a suitable age to engage in honorable 
courtship and enter upon a marriage of their own.134 

Mixed marriages and disparity of cult 



1633 In many countries the situation of a mixed marriage (marriage 
between a Catholic and a baptized non-Catholic) often arises. It 
requires particular attention on the part of couples and their pastors. A 
case of marriage with disparity of cult (between a Catholic and a 
nonbaptized person) requires even greater circumspection. 

1634 Difference of confession between the spouses does not constitute 
an insurmountable obstacle for marriage, when they succeed in placing 
in common what they have received from their respective communities, 
and learn from each other the way in which each lives in fidelity to 
Christ. But the difficulties of mixed marriages must not be 
underestimated. They arise from the fact that the separation of 
Christians has not yet been overcome. the spouses risk experiencing 
the tragedy of Christian disunity even in the heart of their own home. 
Disparity of cult can further aggravate these difficulties. Differences 
about faith and the very notion of marriage, but also different religious 
mentalities, can become sources of tension in marriage, especially as 
regards the education of children. the temptation to religious 
indifference can then arise. 

1635 According to the law in force in the Latin Church, a mixed 
marriage needs for liceity the express permission of ecclesiastical 
authority.135 In case of disparity of cult an express dispensation from 
this impediment is required for the validity of the marriage.136 This 
permission or dispensation presupposes that both parties know and do 
not exclude the essential ends and properties of marriage, and 
furthermore that the Catholic party confirms the obligations, which 
have been made known to the non-Catholic party, of preserving his or 
her own faith and ensuring the baptism and education of the children 
in the Catholic Church.137 

1636 Through ecumenical dialogue Christian communities in many 
regions have been able to put into effect a common pastoral practice 
for mixed marriages. Its task is to help such couples live out their 
particular situation in the light of faith, overcome the tensions between 
the couple's obligations to each other and towards their ecclesial 
communities, and encourage the flowering of what is common to them 
in faith and respect for what separates them. 



1637 In marriages with disparity of cult the Catholic spouse has a 
particular task: "For the unbelieving husband is consecrated through 
his wife, and the unbelieving wife is consecrated through her 
husband."138 It is a great joy for the Christian spouse and for the 
Church if this "consecration" should lead to the free conversion of the 
other spouse to the Christian faith.139 Sincere married love, the 
humble and patient practice of the family virtues, and perseverance in 
prayer can prepare the non-believing spouse to accept the grace of 
conversion.

IV. The Effects of the Sacrament of Matrimony 

1638 "From a valid marriage arises a bond between the spouses which 
by its very nature is perpetual and exclusive; furthermore, in a 
Christian marriage the spouses are strengthened and, as it were, 
consecrated for the duties and the dignity of their state by a special 
sacrament."140 

The marriage bond 

1639 The consent by which the spouses mutually give and receive one 
another is sealed by God himself.141 From their covenant arises "an 
institution, confirmed by the divine law, . . . even in the eyes of 
society."142 The covenant between the spouses is integrated into God's 
covenant with man: "Authentic married love is caught up into divine 
love."143 

1640 Thus the marriage bond has been established by God himself in 
such a way that a marriage concluded and consummated between 
baptized persons can never be dissolved. This bond, which results from 
the free human act of the spouses and their consummation of the 
marriage, is a reality, henceforth irrevocable, and gives rise to a 
covenant guaranteed by God's fidelity. the Church does not have the 
power to contravene this disposition of divine wisdom.144 

The grace of the sacrament of Matrimony 

1641 "By reason of their state in life and of their order, [Christian 
spouses] have their own special gifts in the People of God."145 This 
grace proper to the sacrament of Matrimony is intended to perfect the 
couple's love and to strengthen their indissoluble unity. By this grace 
they "help one another to attain holiness in their married life and in 
welcoming and educating their children."146 

1642 Christ is the source of this grace. "Just as of old God 
encountered his people with a covenant of love and fidelity, so our 
Savior, the spouse of the Church, now encounters Christian spouses 
through the sacrament of Matrimony."147 Christ dwells with them, 



gives them the strength to take up their crosses and so follow him, to 
rise again after they have fallen, to forgive one another, to bear one 
another's burdens, to "be subject to one another out of reverence for 
Christ,"148 and to love one another with supernatural, tender, and 
fruitful love. In the joys of their love and family life he gives them here 
on earth a foretaste of the wedding feast of the Lamb: 

How can I ever express the happiness of a marriage joined by the 
Church, strengthened by an offering, sealed by a blessing, announced 
by angels, and ratified by the Father? . . . How wonderful the bond 
between two believers, now one in hope, one in desire, one in 
discipline, one in the same service! They are both children of one 
Father and servants of the same Master, undivided in spirit and flesh, 
truly two in one flesh. Where the flesh is one, one also is the spirit.149

V. The Goods and Requirements of Conjugal Love 

1643 "Conjugal love involves a totality, in which all the elements of the 
person enter - appeal of the body and instinct, power of feeling and 
affectivity, aspiration of the spirit and of will. It aims at a deeply 
personal unity, a unity that, beyond union in one flesh, leads to 
forming one heart and soul; it demands indissolubility and faithfulness 
in definitive mutual giving; and it is open to fertility. In a word it is a 
question of the normal characteristics of all natural conjugal love, but 
with a new significance which not only purifies and strengthens them, 
but raises them to the extent of making them the expression of 
specifically Christian values."150 

The unity and indissolubility of marriage 

1644 The love of the spouses requires, of its very nature, the unity and 
indissolubility of the spouses' community of persons, which embraces 
their entire life: "so they are no longer two, but one flesh."151 They 
"are called to grow continually in their communion through day-to-day 



fidelity to their marriage promise of total mutual self-giving."152 This 
human communion is confirmed, purified, and completed by 
communion in Jesus Christ, given through the sacrament of 
Matrimony. It is deepened by lives of the common faith and by the 
Eucharist received together. 

1645 "The unity of marriage, distinctly recognized by our Lord, is 
made clear in the equal personal dignity which must be accorded to 
man and wife in mutual and unreserved affection."153 Polygamy is 
contrary to conjugal love which is undivided and exclusive.154 

The fidelity of conjugal love 

1646 By its very nature conjugal love requires the inviolable fidelity of 
the spouses. This is the consequence of the gift of themselves which 
they make to each other. Love seeks to be definitive; it cannot be an 
arrangement "until further notice." the "intimate union of marriage, as 
a mutual giving of two persons, and the good of the children, demand 
total fidelity from the spouses and require an unbreakable union 
between them."155 

1647 The deepest reason is found in the fidelity of God to his 
covenant, in that of Christ to his Church. Through the sacrament of 
Matrimony the spouses are enabled to represent this fidelity and 
witness to it. Through the sacrament, the indissolubility of marriage 
receives a new and deeper meaning. 

1648 It can seem difficult, even impossible, to bind oneself for life to 
another human being. This makes it all the more important to 
proclaim the Good News that God loves us with a definitive and 
irrevocable love, that married couples share in this love, that it 
supports and sustains them, and that by their own faithfulness they can 
be witnesses to God's faithful love. Spouses who with God's grace give 
this witness, often in very difficult conditions, deserve the gratitude 
and support of the ecclesial community.156 

1649 Yet there are some situations in which living together becomes 
practically impossible for a variety of reasons. In such cases the Church 
permits the physical separation of the couple and their living apart. the 
spouses do not cease to be husband and wife before God and so are 
not free to contract a new union. In this difficult situation, the best 



solution would be, if possible, reconciliation. the Christian community 
is called to help these persons live out their situation in a Christian 
manner and in fidelity to their marriage bond which remains 
indissoluble.157 

1650 Today there are numerous Catholics in many countries who have 
recourse to civil divorce and contract new civil unions. In fidelity to the 
words of Jesus Christ - "Whoever divorces his wife and marries 
another, commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband 
and marries another, she commits adultery"158 The Church maintains 
that a new union cannot be recognized as valid, if the first marriage 
was. If the divorced are remarried civilly, they find themselves in a 
situation that objectively contravenes God's law. Consequently, they 
cannot receive Eucharistic communion as long as this situation 
persists. For the same reason, they cannot exercise certain ecclesial 
responsibilities. Reconciliation through the sacrament of Penance can 
be granted only to those who have repented for having violated the sign 
of the covenant and of fidelity to Christ, and who are committed to 
living in complete continence. 

1651 Toward Christians who live in this situation, and who often keep 
the faith and desire to bring up their children in a Christian manner, 
priests and the whole community must manifest an attentive solicitude, 
so that they do not consider themselves separated from the Church, in 
whose life they can and must participate as baptized persons: 

They should be encouraged to listen to the Word of God, to attend the 
Sacrifice of the Mass, to persevere in prayer, to contribute to works of 
charity and to community efforts for justice, to bring up their children 
in the Christian faith, to cultivate the spirit and practice of penance 
and thus implore, day by day, God's grace.159 

The openness to fertility 

1652 "By its very nature the institution of marriage and married love is 
ordered to the procreation and education of the offspring and it is in 
them that it finds its crowning glory."160 

Children are the supreme gift of marriage and contribute greatly to the 
good of the parents themselves. God himself said: "It is not good that 
man should be alone," and "from the beginning (he) made them male 



and female"; wishing to associate them in a special way in his own 
creative work, God blessed man and woman with the words: "Be 
fruitful and multiply." Hence, true married love and the whole 
structure of family life which results from it, without diminishment of 
the other ends of marriage, are directed to disposing the spouses to 
cooperate valiantly with the love of the Creator and Savior, who 
through them will increase and enrich his family from day to day.161 

1653 The fruitfulness of conjugal love extends to the fruits of the 
moral, spiritual, and supernatural life that parents hand on to their 
children by education. Parents are the principal and first educators of 
their children.162 In this sense the fundamental task of marriage and 
family is to be at the service of life.163 

1654 Spouses to whom God has not granted children can nevertheless 
have a conjugal life full of meaning, in both human and Christian 
terms. Their marriage can radiate a fruitfulness of charity, of 
hospitality, and of sacrifice.

VI. The Domestic Church 

1655 Christ chose to be born and grow up in the bosom of the holy 
family of Joseph and Mary. the Church is nothing other than "the 
family of God." From the beginning, the core of the Church was often 
constituted by those who had become believers "together with all 
[their] household."164 When they were converted, they desired that 
"their whole household" should also be saved.165 These families who 
became believers were islands of Christian life in an unbelieving world. 

1656 In our own time, in a world often alien and even hostile to faith, 
believing families are of primary importance as centers of living, 
radiant faith. For this reason the Second Vatican Council, using an 
ancient expression, calls the family the Ecclesia domestica.166 It is in 
the bosom of the family that parents are "by word and example . . . the 
first heralds of the faith with regard to their children. They should 
encourage them in the vocation which is proper to each child, fostering 
with special care any religious vocation."167 

1657 It is here that the father of the family, the mother, children, and 
all members of the family exercise the priesthood of the baptized in a 
privileged way "by the reception of the sacraments, prayer and 
thanksgiving, the witness of a holy life, and self-denial and active 
charity."168 Thus the home is the first school of Christian life and "a 
school for human enrichment."169 Here one learns endurance and the 
joy of work, fraternal love, generous - even repeated - forgiveness, and 
above all divine worship in prayer and the offering of one's life. 

1658 We must also remember the great number of single persons who, 
because of the particular circumstances in which they have to live - 
often not of their choosing - are especially close to Jesus' heart and 
therefore deserve the special affection and active solicitude of the 
Church, especially of pastors. Many remain without a human family 
often due to conditions of poverty. Some live their situation in the 



spirit of the Beatitudes, serving God and neighbor in exemplary 
fashion. the doors of homes, the "domestic churches," and of the great 
family which is the Church must be open to all of them. "No one is 
without a family in this world: the Church is a home and family for 
everyone, especially those who 'labor and are heavy laden.'"170

CHAPTER THREE THE SACRAMENTS AT THE SERVICE OF 
COMMUNION 

 

 

 

Article 7 THE SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY 

 

 

IN BRIEF 



1659 St. Paul said: "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the 
Church.... This is a great mystery, and I mean in reference to Christ 
and the Church" (Eph 5:25, 32). 

1660 The marriage covenant, by which a man and a woman form with 
each other an intimate communion of life and love, has been founded 
and endowed with its own special laws by the Creator. By its very 
nature it is ordered to the good of the couple, as well as to the 
generation and education of children. Christ the Lord raised marriage 
between the baptized to the dignity of a sacrament (cf CIC, can. 1055 
# 1; cf. GS 48 # 1). 

1661 The sacrament of Matrimony signifies the union of Christ and 
the Church. It gives spouses the grace to love each other with the love 
with which Christ has loved his Church; the grace of the sacrament 
thus perfects the human love of the spouses, strengthens their 
indissoluble unity, and sanctifies them on the way to eternal life (cf 
Council of Trent: DS 1799). 

1662 Marriage is based on the consent of the contracting parties, that 
is, on their will to give themselves, each to the other, mutually and 
definitively, in order to live a covenant of faithful and fruitful love. 

1663 Since marriage establishes the couple in a public state of life in 
the Church, it is fitting that its celebration be public, in the framework 
of a liturgical celebration, before the priest (or a witness authorized by 
the Church), the witnesses, and the assembly of the faithful. 

1664 Unity, indissolubility, and openness to fertility are essential to 
marriage. Polygamy is incompatible with the unity of marriage; divorce 
separates what God has joined together; the refusal of fertility turns 
married life away from its "supreme gift," the child (GS 50 # 1). 

1665 The remarriage of persons divorced from a living, lawful spouse 
contravenes the plan and law of God as taught by Christ. They are not 
separated from the Church, but they cannot receive Eucharistic 
communion. They will lead Christian lives especially by educating their 
children in the faith. 

1666 The Christian home is the place where children receive the first 
proclamation of the faith. For this reason the family home is rightly 



called "the domestic church," a community of grace and prayer, a 
school of human virtues and of Christian charity.

MYSTERY 

 

 

 

SECTION TWO THE SEVEN SACRAMENTS OF THE CHURCH 

 

 

CHAPTER FOUR OTHER LITURGICAL CELEBRATIONS 

Article 1 

SACRAMENTALS 

1667 "Holy Mother Church has, moreover, instituted sacramentals. 
These are sacred signs which bear a resemblance to the sacraments. 
They signify effects, particularly of a spiritual nature, which are 
obtained through the intercession of the Church. By them men are 



disposed to receive the chief effect of the sacraments, and various 
occasions in life are rendered holy."171 

The characteristics of sacramentals 

1668 Sacramentals are instituted for the sanctification of certain 
ministries of the Church, certain states of life, a great variety of 
circumstances in Christian life, and the use of many things helpful to 
man. In accordance with bishops' pastoral decisions, they can also 
respond to the needs, culture, and special history of the Christian 
people of a particular region or time. They always include a prayer, 
often accompanied by a specific sign, such as the laying on of hands, 
the sign of the cross, or the sprinkling of holy water (which recalls 
Baptism). 

1669 Sacramentals derive from the baptismal priesthood: every 
baptized person is called to be a "blessing," and to bless.172 Hence lay 
people may preside at certain blessings; the more a blessing concerns 
ecclesial and sacramental life, the more is its administration reserved to 
the ordained ministry (bishops, priests, or deacons).173 

1670 Sacramentals do not confer the grace of the Holy Spirit in the 
way that the sacraments do, but by the Church's prayer, they prepare 
us to receive grace and dispose us to cooperate with it. "For well-
disposed members of the faithful, the liturgy of the sacraments and 
sacramentals sanctifies almost every event of their lives with the divine 
grace which flows from the Paschal mystery of the Passion, Death, and 
Resurrection of Christ. From this source all sacraments and 
sacramentals draw their power. There is scarcely any proper use of 
material things which cannot be thus directed toward the sanctification 
of men and the praise of God."174 

Various forms of sacramentals 

1671 Among sacramentals blessings (of persons, meals, objects, and 
places) come first. Every blessing praises God and prays for his gifts. In 
Christ, Christians are blessed by God the Father "with every spiritual 
blessing."175 This is why the Church imparts blessings by invoking the 
name of Jesus, usually while making the holy sign of the cross of 
Christ. 



1672 Certain blessings have a lasting importance because they 
consecrate persons to God, or reserve objects and places for liturgical 
use. Among those blessings which are intended for persons - not to be 
confused with sacramental ordination - are the blessing of the abbot or 
abbess of a monastery, the consecration of virgins and widows, the rite 
of religious profession and the blessing of certain ministries of the 
Church (readers, acolytes, catechists, etc.). The dedication or blessing 
of a church or an altar, the blessing of holy oils, vessels, and vestments, 
bells, etc., can be mentioned as examples of blessings that concern 
objects. 

1673 When the Church asks publicly and authoritatively in the name 
of Jesus Christ that a person or object be protected against the power 
of the Evil One and withdrawn from his dominion, it is called 
exorcism. Jesus performed exorcisms and from him the Church has 
received the power and office of exorcizing.176 In a simple form, 
exorcism is performed at the celebration of Baptism. the solemn 
exorcism, called "a major exorcism," can be performed only by a priest 
and with the permission of the bishop. the priest must proceed with 
prudence, strictly observing the rules established by the Church. 
Exorcism is directed at the expulsion of demons or to the liberation 
from demonic possession through the spiritual authority which Jesus 
entrusted to his Church. Illness, especially psychological illness, is a 
very different matter; treating this is the concern of medical science. 
Therefore, before an exorcism is performed, it is important to ascertain 
that one is dealing with the presence of the Evil One, and not an 
illness.177 

Popular piety 

1674 Besides sacramental liturgy and sacramentals, catechesis must 
take into account the forms of piety and popular devotions among the 
faithful. the religious sense of the Christian people has always found 
expression in various forms of piety surrounding the Church's 
sacramental life, such as the veneration of relics, visits to sanctuaries, 
pilgrimages, processions, the stations of the cross, religious dances, the 
rosary, medals,178 etc. 

1675 These expressions of piety extend the liturgical life of the 
Church, but do not replace it. They "should be so drawn up that they 



harmonize with the liturgical seasons, accord with the sacred liturgy, 
are in some way derived from it and lead the people to it, since in fact 
the liturgy by its very nature is far superior to any of them."179 

1676 Pastoral discernment is needed to sustain and support popular 
piety and, if necessary, to purify and correct the religious sense which 
underlies these devotions so that the faithful may advance in 
knowledge of the mystery of Christ.180 Their exercise is subject to the 
care and judgment of the bishops and to the general norms of the 
Church. 

At its core the piety of the people is a storehouse of values that offers 
answers of Christian wisdom to the great questions of life. the Catholic 
wisdom of the people is capable of fashioning a vital synthesis.... It 
creatively combines the divine and the human, Christ and Mary, spirit 
and body, communion and institution, person and community, faith 
and homeland, intelligence and emotion. This wisdom is a Christian 
humanism that radically affirms the dignity of every person as a child 
of God, establishes a basic fraternity, teaches people to encounter 
nature and understand work, provides reasons for joy and humor even 
in the midst of a very hard life. For the people this wisdom is also a 
principle of discernment and an evangelical instinct through which 
they spontaneously sense when the Gospel is served in the Church and 
when it is emptied of its content and stifled by other interests.181

Article 1 SACRAMENTALS 

 

 

IN BRIEF 



1677 Sacramentals are sacred signs instituted by the Church. They 
prepare men to receive the fruit of the sacraments and sanctify 
different circumstances of life. 

1678 Among the sacramentals blessings occupy an important place. 
They include both praise of God for his works and gifts, and the 
Church's intercession for men that they may be able to use God's gifts 
according to the spirit of the Gospel. 

1679 In addition to the liturgy, Christian life is nourished by various 
forms of popular piety, rooted in the different cultures. While carefully 
clarifying them in the light of faith, the Church fosters the forms of 
popular piety that express an evangelical instinct and a human wisdom 
and that enrich Christian life.

Article 2 CHRISTIAN FUNERALS 

1680 All the sacraments, and principally those of Christian initiation, 
have as their goal the last Passover of the child of God which, through 
death, leads him into the life of the Kingdom. Then what he confessed 
in faith and hope will be fulfilled: "I look for the resurrection of the 
dead, and the life of the world to come."182

Article 2 CHRISTIAN FUNERALS 

 

 

I. The Christian's Last Passover 

1681 The Christian meaning of death is revealed in the light of the 
Paschal mystery of the death and resurrection of Christ in whom 
resides our only hope. the Christian who dies in Christ Jesus is "away 
from the body and at home with the Lord."183 

1682 For the Christian the day of death inaugurates, at the end of his 
sacramental life, the fulfillment of his new birth begun at Baptism, the 
definitive "conformity" to "the image of the Son" conferred by the 
anointing of the Holy Spirit, and participation in the feast of the 
Kingdom which was anticipated in the Eucharist - even if final 
purifications are still necessary for him in order to be clothed with the 
nuptial garment. 

1683 The Church who, as Mother, has borne the Christian 
sacramentally in her womb during his earthly pilgrimage, accompanies 
him at his journey's end, in order to surrender him "into the Father's 
hands." She offers to the Father, in Christ, the child of his grace, and 
she commits to the earth, in hope, the seed of the body that will rise in 
glory.184 This offering is fully celebrated in the Eucharistic sacrifice; 
the blessings before and after Mass are sacramentals.

Article 2 CHRISTIAN FUNERALS 

 

 

II. The Celebration of Funerals 

1684 The Christian funeral is a liturgical celebration of the Church. 
The ministry of the Church in this instance aims at expressing 
efficacious communion with the deceased, at the participation in that 
communion of the community gathered for the funeral, and at the 
proclamation of eternal life to the community. 

1685 The different funeral rites express the Paschal character of 
Christian death and are in keeping with the situations and traditions of 
each region, even as to the color of the liturgical vestments worn.186 

1686 The Order of Christian Funerals (Ordo exsequiarum) of the 
Roman liturgy gives three types of funeral celebrations, corresponding 
to the three places in which they are conducted (the home, the church, 
and the cemetery), and according to the importance attached to them 
by the family, local customs, the culture, and popular piety. This order 
of celebration is common to all the liturgical traditions and comprises 
four principal elements: 

1687 The greeting of the community. A greeting of faith begins the 
celebration. Relatives and friends of the deceased are welcomed with a 
word of "consolation" (in the New Testament sense of the Holy Spirit's 
power in hope).187 The community of prayer assembling in prayer 
also awaits the "words of eternal life." The death of a member of the 
community (or the anniversary of a death, or the seventh or thirtieth 
day after death) is an event that should lead beyond the perspectives of 
"this world" and should draw the faithful into the true perspective of 
faith in the risen Christ. 

1688 The liturgy of the Word during funerals demands very careful 
preparation because the assembly present for the funeral may include 
some faithful who rarely attend the liturgy, and friends of the deceased 



who are not Christians. the homily in particular must "avoid the 
literary genre of funeral eulogy"188 and illumine the mystery of 
Christian death in the light of the risen Christ. 

1689 The Eucharistic Sacrifice. When the celebration takes place in 
church the Eucharist is the heart of the Paschal reality of Christian 
death.189 In the Eucharist, the Church expresses her efficacious 
communion with the departed: offering to the Father in the Holy Spirit 
the sacrifice of the death and resurrection of Christ, she asks to purify 
his child of his sins and their consequences, and to admit him to the 
Paschal fullness of the table of the Kingdom.190 It is by the Eucharist 
thus celebrated that the community of the faithful, especially the family 
of the deceased, learn to live in communion with the one who "has 
fallen asleep in the Lord," by communicating in the Body of Christ of 
which he is a living member and, then, by praying for him and with 
him. 

1690 A farewell to the deceased is his final "commendation to God" by 
the Church. It is "the last farewell by which the Christian community 
greets one of its members before his body is brought to its tomb."191 
The Byzantine tradition expresses this by the kiss of farewell to the 
deceased: 

By this final greeting "we sing for his departure from this life and 
separation from us, but also because there is a communion and a 
reunion. For even dead, we are not at all separated from one another, 
because we all run the same course and we will find one another again 
in the same place. We shall never be separated, for we live for Christ, 
and now we are united with Christ as we go toward him . . . we shall all 
be together in Christ."192

PART THREE: LIFE IN CHRIST 

1691 "Christian, recognize your dignity and, now that you share in 
God's own nature, do not return to your former base condition by 
sinning. Remember who is your head and of whose body you are a 
member. Never forget that you have been rescued from the power of 
darkness and brought into the light of the Kingdom of God."1 

1692 The Symbol of the faith confesses the greatness of God's gifts to 
man in his work of creation, and even more in redemption and 
sanctification. What faith confesses, the sacraments communicate: by 
the sacraments of rebirth, Christians have become "children of God,"2 
"partakers of the divine nature."3 Coming to see in the faith their new 
dignity, Christians are called to lead henceforth a life "worthy of the 
gospel of Christ."4 They are made capable of doing so by the grace of 
Christ and the gifts of his Spirit, which they receive through the 
sacraments and through prayer. 

1693 Christ Jesus always did what was pleasing to the Father,5 and 
always lived in perfect communion with him. Likewise Christ's 
disciples are invited to live in the sight of the Father "who sees in 
secret,"6 in order to become "perfect as your heavenly Father is 
perfect."7 

1694 Incorporated into Christ by Baptism, Christians are "dead to sin 
and alive to God in Christ Jesus" and so participate in the life of the 
Risen Lord.8 Following Christ and united with him,9 Christians can 
strive to be "imitators of God as beloved children, and walk in love"10 
by conforming their thoughts, words and actions to the "mind . . . 
which is yours in Christ Jesus,"11 and by following his example.12 

1695 "Justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit 
of our God,"13 "sanctified . . . (and) called to be saints,"14 Christians 
have become the temple of the Holy Spirit.15 This "Spirit of the Son" 
teaches them to pray to the Father16 and, having become their life, 
prompts them to act so as to bear "the fruit of the Spirit"17 by charity 
in action. Healing the wounds of sin, the Holy Spirit renews us 
interiorly through a spiritual transformation.18 He enlightens and 



strengthens us to live as "children of light" through "all that is good 
and right and true."19 

1696 The way of Christ "leads to life"; a contrary way "leads to 
destruction."20 The Gospel parable of the two ways remains ever 
present in the catechesis of the Church; it shows the importance of 
moral decisions for our salvation: "There are two ways, the one of life, 
the other of death; but between the two, there is a great difference."21 

1697 Catechesis has to reveal in all clarity the joy and the demands of 
the way of Christ.22 Catechesis for the "newness of life"23 in him 
should be:  

-a catechesis of the Holy Spirit, the interior Master of life according to 
Christ, a gentle guest and friend who inspires, guides, corrects, and 
strengthens this life;  

-a catechesis of grace, for it is by grace that we are saved and again it is 
by grace that our works can bear fruit for eternal life;  

-a catechesis of the beatitudes, for the way of Christ is summed up in 
the beatitudes, the only path that leads to the eternal beatitude for 
which the human heart longs;  

-a catechesis of sin and forgiveness, for unless man acknowledges that 
he is a sinner he cannot know the truth about himself, which is a 
condition for acting justly; and without the offer of forgiveness he 
would not be able to bear this truth;  

-a catechesis of the human virtues which causes one to grasp the 
beauty and attraction of right dispositions towards goodness;  

-a catechesis of the Christian virtues of faith, hope, and charity, 
generously inspired by the example of the saints; -a catechesis of the 
twofold commandment of charity set forth in the Decalogue;  

-an ecclesial catechesis, for it is through the manifold exchanges of 
"spiritual goods" in the "communion of saints" that Christian life can 
grow, develop, and be communicated. 

1698 The first and last point of reference of this catechesis will always 
be Jesus Christ himself, who is "the way, and the truth, and the life."24 
It is by looking to him in faith that Christ's faithful can hope that he 



himself fulfills his promises in them, and that, by loving him with the 
same love with which he has loved them, they may perform works in 
keeping with their dignity: 

I ask you to consider that our Lord Jesus Christ is your true head, and 
that you are one of his members. He belongs to you as the head 
belongs to its members; all that is his is yours: his spirit, his heart, his 
body and soul, and all his faculties. You must make use of all these as 
of your own, to serve, praise, love, and glorify God. You belong to him, 
as members belong to their head. and so he longs for you to use all that 
is in you, as if it were his own, for the service and glory of the 
Father.25 

  

For to me, to live is Christ.26

CHAPTER ONE THE DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN PERSON 

1700 The dignity of the human person is rooted in his creation in the 
image and likeness of God (article 1); it is fulfilled in his vocation to 
divine beatitude (article 2). It is essential to a human being freely to 
direct himself to this fulfillment (article 3). By his deliberate actions 
(article 4), the human person does, or does not, conform to the good 
promised by God and attested by moral conscience (article 5). Human 
beings make their own contribution to their interior growth; they make 
their whole sentient and spiritual lives into means of this growth 
(article 6). With the help of grace they grow in virtue (article 7), avoid 
sin, and if they sin they entrust themselves as did the prodigal son1 to 



the mercy of our Father in heaven (article 8). In this way they attain to 
the perfection of charity.

Article 1 MAN: THE IMAGE OF GOD 



1701 "Christ, . . . in the very revelation of the mystery of the Father 
and of his love, makes man fully manifest to himself and brings to light 
his exalted vocation."2 It is in Christ, "the image of the invisible 
God,"3 that man has been created "in the image and likeness" of the 
Creator. It is in Christ, Redeemer and Savior, that the divine image, 
disfigured in man by the first sin, has been restored to its original 
beauty and ennobled by the grace of God.4 

1702 The divine image is present in every man. It shines forth in the 
communion of persons, in the likeness of the unity of the divine 
persons among themselves (cf chapter two). 

1703 Endowed with "a spiritual and immortal" soul,5 The human 
person is "the only creature on earth that God has willed for its own 
sake."6 From his conception, he is destined for eternal beatitude. 

1704 The human person participates in the light and power of the 
divine Spirit. By his reason, he is capable of understanding the order of 
things established by the Creator. By free will, he is capable of 
directing himself toward his true good. He finds his perfection "in 
seeking and loving what is true and good."7 

1705 By virtue of his soul and his spiritual powers of intellect and will, 
man is endowed with freedom, an "outstanding manifestation of the 
divine image."8 

1706 By his reason, man recognizes the voice of God which urges him 
"to do what is good and avoid what is evil."9 Everyone is obliged to 
follow this law, which makes itself heard in conscience and is fulfilled 
in the love of God and of neighbor. Living a moral life bears witness to 
the dignity of the person. 

1707 "Man, enticed by the Evil One, abused his freedom at the very 
beginning of history."10 He succumbed to temptation and did what 
was evil. He still desires the good, but his nature bears the wound of 
original sin. He is now inclined to evil and subject to error:  

Man is divided in himself. As a result, the whole life of men, both 
individual and social, shows itself to be a struggle, and a dramatic one, 
between good and evil, between light and darkness.11 



1708 By his Passion, Christ delivered us from Satan and from sin. He 
merited for us the new life in the Holy Spirit. His grace restores what 
sin had damaged in us. 

1709 He who believes in Christ becomes a son of God. This filial 
adoption transforms him by giving him the ability to follow the 
example of Christ. It makes him capable of acting rightly and doing 
good. In union with his Savior, the disciple attains the perfection of 
charity which is holiness. Having matured in grace, the moral life 
blossoms into eternal life in the glory of heaven.

IN BRIEF 

1710 "Christ . . . makes man fully manifest to man himself and brings 
to light his exalted vocation" (GS 22 # 1). 

1711 Endowed with a spiritual soul, with intellect and with free will, 
the human person is from his very conception ordered to God and 
destined for eternal beatitude. He pursues his perfection in "seeking 
and loving what is true and good" (GS 15 # 2). 

1712 In man, true freedom is an "outstanding manifestation of the 
divine image" (GS 17). 

1713 Man is obliged to follow the moral law, which urges him "to do 
what is good and avoid what is evil" (cf GS 16). This law makes itself 
heard in his conscience. 

1714 Man, having been wounded in his nature by original sin, is 
subject to error and inclined to evil in exercising his freedom. 

1715 He who believes in Christ has new life in the Holy Spirit. the 
moral life, increased and brought to maturity in grace, is to reach its 
fulfillment in the glory of heaven.

Article 2 OUR VOCATION TO BEATITUDE 

I. The Beatitudes 

1716 The Beatitudes are at the heart of Jesus' preaching. They take up 
the promises made to the chosen people since Abraham. the Beatitudes 
fulfill the promises by ordering them no longer merely to the 
possession of a territory, but to the Kingdom of heaven: 

Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  

Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.  

Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.  



Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they 
shall be satisfied.  

Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.  

Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.  

Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.  

Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs 
is the kingdom of heaven.  

Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all 
kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.  

Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven.12 

1717 The Beatitudes depict the countenance of Jesus Christ and 
portray his charity. They express the vocation of the faithful associated 
with the glory of his Passion and Resurrection; they shed light on the 
actions and attitudes characteristic of the Christian life; they are the 
paradoxical promises that sustain hope in the midst of tribulations; 
they proclaim the blessings and rewards already secured, however 
dimly, for Christ's disciples; they have begun in the lives of the Virgin 
Mary and all the saints.

II. The Desire for Happiness 

1718 The Beatitudes respond to the natural desire for happiness. This 
desire is of divine origin: God has placed it in the human heart in order 
to draw man to the One who alone can fulfill it: 

We all want to live happily; in the whole human race there is no one 
who does not assent to this proposition, even before it is fully 
articulated.13 

  

How is it, then, that I seek you, Lord? Since in seeking you, my God, I 
seek a happy life, let me seek you so that my soul may live, for my body 
draws life from my soul and my soul draws life from you.14 

  



God alone satisfies.15 

1719 The Beatitudes reveal the goal of human existence, the ultimate 
end of human acts: God calls us to his own beatitude. This vocation is 
addressed to each individual personally, but also to the Church as a 
whole, the new people made up of those who have accepted the 
promise and live from it in faith.

Article 2 OUR VOCATION TO BEATITUDE 

 

 

III. Christian Beatitude 

1720 The New Testament uses several expressions to characterize the 
beatitude to which God calls man:  

- the coming of the Kingdom of God;16  

- the vision of God: "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see 
God"17  

- entering into the joy of the Lord;18  

- entering into God's rest:19 

There we shall rest and see, we shall see and love, we shall love and 
praise. Behold what will be at the end without end. For what other end 
do we have, if not to reach the kingdom which has no end?20 

1721 God put us in the world to know, to love, and to serve him, and 
so to come to paradise. Beatitude makes us "partakers of the divine 
nature" and of eternal life.21 With beatitude, man enters into the glory 
of Christ22 and into the joy of the Trinitarian life. 



1722 Such beatitude surpasses the understanding and powers of man. 
It comes from an entirely free gift of God: whence it is called 
supernatural, as is the grace that disposes man to enter into the divine 
joy. 

"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." 

It is true, because of the greatness and inexpressible glory of God, that 
"man shall not see me and live," for the Father cannot be grasped. But 
because of God's love and goodness toward us, and because he can do 
all things, he goes so far as to grant those who love him the privilege of 
seeing him.... For "what is impossible for men is possible for God."23 

1723 The beatitude we are promised confronts us with decisive moral 
choices. It invites us to purify our hearts of bad instincts and to seek 
the love of God above all else. It teaches us that true happiness is not 
found in riches or well-being, in human fame or power, or in any 
human achievement - however beneficial it may be - such as science, 
technology, and art, or indeed in any creature, but in God alone, the 
source of every good and of all love: 

All bow down before wealth. Wealth is that to which the multitude of 
men pay an instinctive homage. They measure happiness by wealth; 
and by wealth they measure respectability.... It is a homage resulting 
from a profound faith ... that with wealth he may do all things. Wealth 
is one idol of the day and notoriety is a second.... Notoriety, or the 
making of a noise in the world - it may be called "newspaper fame" - 
has come to be considered a great good in itself, and a ground of 
veneration.24 

1724 The Decalogue, the Sermon on the Mount, and the apostolic 
catechesis describe for us the paths that lead to the Kingdom of 
heaven. Sustained by the grace of the Holy Spirit, we tread them, step 
by step, by everyday acts. By the working of the Word of Christ, we 
slowly bear fruit in the Church to the glory of God.25

IN BRIEF 

1725 The Beatitudes take up and fulfill God's promises from Abraham 
on by ordering them to the Kingdom of heaven. They respond to the 
desire for happiness that God has placed in the human heart. 

1726 The Beatitudes teach us the final end to which God calls us: the 
Kingdom, the vision of God, participation in the divine nature, eternal 
life, filiation, rest in God. 

1727 The beatitude of eternal life is a gratuitous gift of God. It is 
supernatural, as is the grace that leads us there. 

1728 The Beatitudes confront us with decisive choices concerning 
earthly goods; they purify our hearts in order to teach us to love God 
above all things. 

1729 The beatitude of heaven sets the standards for discernment in the 
use of earthly goods in keeping with the law of God.

Article 3 MAN'S FREEDOM 

1730 God created man a rational being, conferring on him the dignity 
of a person who can initiate and control his own actions. "God willed 
that man should be 'left in the hand of his own counsel,' so that he 
might of his own accord seek his Creator and freely attain his full and 
blessed perfection by cleaving to him."26 

Man is rational and therefore like God; he is created with free will and 
is master over his acts.27

Article 3 MAN'S FREEDOM 

 

 

I. Freedom and Responsibility 

1731 Freedom is the power, rooted in reason and will, to act or not to 
act, to do this or that, and so to perform deliberate actions on one's 
own responsibility. By free will one shapes one's own life. Human 
freedom is a force for growth and maturity in truth and goodness; it 
attains its perfection when directed toward God, our beatitude. 



1732 As long as freedom has not bound itself definitively to its 
ultimate good which is God, there is the possibility of choosing 
between good and evil, and thus of growing in perfection or of failing 
and sinning. This freedom characterizes properly human acts. It is the 
basis of praise or blame, merit or reproach. 

1733 The more one does what is good, the freer one becomes. There is 
no true freedom except in the service of what is good and just. the 
choice to disobey and do evil is an abuse of freedom and leads to "the 
slavery of sin."28 

1734 Freedom makes man responsible for his acts to the extent that 
they are voluntary. Progress in virtue, knowledge of the good, and 
ascesis enhance the mastery of the will over its acts. 

1735 Imputability and responsibility for an action can be diminished 
or even nullified by ignorance, inadvertence, duress, fear, habit, 
inordinate attachments, and other psychological or social factors. 

1736 Every act directly willed is imputable to its author: 

Thus the Lord asked Eve after the sin in the garden: "What is this that 
you have done?"29 He asked Cain the same question.30 The prophet 
Nathan questioned David in the same way after he committed adultery 
with the wife of Uriah and had him murdered.31  

An action can be indirectly voluntary when it results from negligence 
regarding something one should have known or done: for example, an 
accident arising from ignorance of traffic laws. 

1737 An effect can be tolerated without being willed by its agent; for 
instance, a mother's exhaustion from tending her sick child. A bad 
effect is not imputable if it was not willed either as an end or as a 
means of an action, e.g., a death a person incurs in aiding someone in 
danger. For a bad effect to be imputable it must be foreseeable and the 
agent must have the possibility of avoiding it, as in the case of 
manslaughter caused by a drunken driver. 

1738 Freedom is exercised in relationships between human beings. 
Every human person, created in the image of God, has the natural 
right to be recognized as a free and responsible being. All owe to each 
other this duty of respect. the right to the exercise of freedom, 



especially in moral and religious matters, is an inalienable requirement 
of the dignity of the human person. This right must be recognized and 
protected by civil authority within the limits of the common good and 
public order.32

Article 3 MAN'S FREEDOM 

 

 

II. Human Freedom in the Economy of Salvation 

1739 Freedom and sin. Man's freedom is limited and fallible. In fact, 
man failed. He freely sinned. By refusing God's plan of love, he 
deceived himself and became a slave to sin. This first alienation 
engendered a multitude of others. From its outset, human history 
attests the wretchedness and oppression born of the human heart in 
consequence of the abuse of freedom. 

1740 Threats to freedom. the exercise of freedom does not imply a 
right to say or do everything. It is false to maintain that man, "the 
subject of this freedom," is "an individual who is fully self-sufficient 
and whose finality is the satisfaction of his own interests in the 
enjoyment of earthly goods."33 Moreover, the economic, social, 
political, and cultural conditions that are needed for a just exercise of 



freedom are too often disregarded or violated. Such situations of 
blindness and injustice injure the moral life and involve the strong as 
well as the weak in the temptation to sin against charity. By deviating 
from the moral law man violates his own freedom, becomes 
imprisoned within himself, disrupts neighborly fellowship, and rebels 
against divine truth. 

1741 Liberation and salvation. By his glorious Cross Christ has won 
salvation for all men. He redeemed them from the sin that held them 
in bondage. "For freedom Christ has set us free."34 In him we have 
communion with the "truth that makes us free."35 The Holy Spirit has 
been given to us and, as the Apostle teaches, "Where the Spirit of the 
Lord is, there is freedom."36 Already we glory in the "liberty of the 
children of God."37 

1742 Freedom and grace. the grace of Christ is not in the slightest way 
a rival of our freedom when this freedom accords with the sense of the 
true and the good that God has put in the human heart. On the 
contrary, as Christian experience attests especially in prayer, the more 
docile we are to the promptings of grace, the more we grow in inner 
freedom and confidence during trials, such as those we face in the 
pressures and constraints of the outer world. By the working of grace 
the Holy Spirit educates us in spiritual freedom in order to make us 
free collaborators in his work in the Church and in the world: 

Almighty and merciful God, 

in your goodness take away from us all that is harmful, 

so that, made ready both in mind and body, 

we may freely accomplish your will.38

IN BRIEF 

1743 "God willed that man should be left in the hand of his own 
counsel (cf Sir 15:14), so that he might of his own accord seek his 
creator and freely attain his full and blessed perfection by cleaving to 
him" (GS 17 # 1). 

1744 Freedom is the power to act or not to act, and so to perform 
deliberate acts of one's own. Freedom attains perfection in its acts 
when directed toward God, the sovereign Good. 

1745 Freedom characterizes properly human acts. It makes the human 
being responsible for acts of which he is the voluntary agent. His 
deliberate acts properly belong to him. 

1746 The imputability or responsibility for an action can be diminished 
or nullified by ignorance, duress, fear, and other psychological or social 
factors. 



1747 The right to the exercise of freedom, especially in religious and 
moral matters, is an inalienable requirement of the dignity of man. But 
the exercise of freedom does not entail the putative right to say or do 
anything.

1749 Freedom makes man a moral subject. When he acts deliberately, 
man is, so to speak, the father of his acts. Human acts, that is, acts that 
are freely chosen in consequence of a judgment of conscience, can be 
morally evaluated. They are either good or evil.

Article 4 THE MORALITY OF HUMAN ACTS 



 

 

I. The Sources of Morality 

1750 The morality of human acts depends on:  

- the object chosen;  

- the end in view or the intention;  

- the circumstances of the action.  

The object, the intention, and the circumstances make up the 
"sources," or constitutive elements, of the morality of human acts. 

1751 The object chosen is a good toward which the will deliberately 
directs itself. It is the matter of a human act. the object chosen morally 
specifies the act of the will, insofar as reason recognizes and judges it to 
be or not to be in conformity with the true good. Objective norms of 
morality express the rational order of good and evil, attested to by 
conscience. 

1752 In contrast to the object, the intention resides in the acting 
subject. Because it lies at the voluntary source of an action and 
determines it by its end, intention is an element essential to the moral 
evaluation of an action. the end is the first goal of the intention and 
indicates the purpose pursued in the action. the intention is a 
movement of the will toward the end: it is concerned with the goal of 
the activity. It aims at the good anticipated from the action undertaken. 
Intention is not limited to directing individual actions, but can guide 
several actions toward one and the same purpose; it can orient one's 
whole life toward its ultimate end. For example, a service done with 
the end of helping one's neighbor can at the same time be inspired by 
the love of God as the ultimate end of all our actions. One and the 
same action can also be inspired by several intentions, such as 
performing a service in order to obtain a favor or to boast about it. 

1753 A good intention (for example, that of helping one's neighbor) 
does not make behavior that is intrinsically disordered, such as lying 
and calumny, good or just. the end does not justify the means. Thus 
the condemnation of an innocent person cannot be justified as a 



legitimate means of saving the nation. On the other hand, an added 
bad intention (such as vainglory) makes an act evil that, in and of 
itself, can be good (such as almsgiving).39 

1754 The circumstances, including the consequences, are secondary 
elements of a moral act. They contribute to increasing or diminishing 
the moral goodness or evil of human acts (for example, the amount of 
a theft). They can also diminish or increase the agent's responsibility 
(such as acting out of a fear of death). Circumstances of themselves 
cannot change the moral quality of acts themselves; they can make 
neither good nor right an action that is in itself evil.

Article 4 THE MORALITY OF HUMAN ACTS 

 

 

II. Good Acts and Evil Acts 

1755 A morally good act requires the goodness of the object, of the 
end, and of the circumstances together. An evil end corrupts the 
action, even if the object is good in itself (such as praying and fasting 
"in order to be seen by men").  

The object of the choice can by itself vitiate an act in its entirety. There 
are some concrete acts - such as fornication - that it is always wrong to 
choose, because choosing them entails a disorder of the will, that is, a 
moral evil. 

1756 It is therefore an error to judge the morality of human acts by 
considering only the intention that inspires them or the circumstances 
(environment, social pressure, duress or emergency, etc.) which supply 
their context. There are acts which, in and of themselves, 
independently of circumstances and intentions, are always gravely illicit 
by reason of their object; such as blasphemy and perjury, murder and 
adultery. One may not do evil so that good may result from it.

Article 4 THE MORALITY OF HUMAN ACTS 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

1757 The object, the intention, and the circumstances make up the 
three "sources" of the morality of human acts. 

1758 The object chosen orally specifies the act of willing accordingly as 
reason recognizes and judges it good or evil. 



1759 "An evil action cannot be justified by reference to a good 
intention" (cf St. Thomas Aquinas, Dec. praec. 6). the end does not 
justify the means. 

1760 A morally good act requires the goodness of its object, of its end, 
and of its circumstances together. 

1761 There are concrete acts that it is always wrong to choose, because 
their choice entails a disorder of the will, i.e., a moral evil. One may 
not do evil so that good may result from it.

Article 5 THE MORALITY OF THE PASSIONS 

 

 

I. Passions 

1763 The term "passions" belongs to the Christian patrimony. Feelings 
or passions are emotions or movements of the sensitive appetite that 
incline us to act or not to act in regard to something felt or imagined to 
be good or evil. 

1764 The passions are natural components of the human psyche; they 
form the passageway and ensure the connection between the life of the 
senses and the life of the mind. Our Lord called man's heart the source 
from which the passions spring.40 

1765 There are many passions. the most fundamental passion is love, 
aroused by the attraction of the good. Love causes a desire for the 
absent good and the hope of obtaining it; this movement finds 
completion in the pleasure and joy of the good possessed. the 
apprehension of evil causes hatred, aversion, and fear of the impending 
evil; this movement ends in sadness at some present evil, or in the 
anger that resists it. 

1766 "To love is to will the good of another."41 All other affections 
have their source in this first movement of the human heart toward the 
good. Only the good can be loved.42 Passions "are evil if love is evil 
and good if it is good."43

Article 5 THE MORALITY OF THE PASSIONS 

 

 

II. Passions and Moral Life 

1767 In themselves passions are neither good nor evil. They are 
morally qualified only to the extent that they effectively engage reason 
and will. Passions are said to be voluntary, "either because they are 
commanded by the will or because the will does not place obstacles in 
their way."44 It belongs to the perfection of the moral or human good 
that the passions be governed by reason.45 

1768 Strong feelings are not decisive for the morality or the holiness of 
persons; they are simply the inexhaustible reservoir of images and 
affections in which the moral life is expressed. Passions are morally 
good when they contribute to a good action, evil in the opposite case. 
the upright will orders the movements of the senses it appropriates to 
the good and to beatitude; an evil will succumbs to disordered passions 
and exacerbates them. Emotions and feelings can be taken up into the 
virtues or perverted by the vices. 

1769 In the Christian life, the Holy Spirit himself accomplishes his 
work by mobilizing the whole being, with all its sorrows, fears and 
sadness, as is visible in the Lord's agony and passion. In Christ human 
feelings are able to reach their consummation in charity and divine 
beatitude. 

1770 Moral perfection consists in man's being moved to the good not 
by his will alone, but also by his sensitive appetite, as in the words of 
the psalm: "My heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God."46

Article 5 THE MORALITY OF THE PASSIONS 



 

 

IN BRIEF 

1771 The term "passions" refers to the affections or the feelings. By his 
emotions man intuits the good and suspects evil. 

1772 The principal passions are love and hatred, desire and fear, joy, 
sadness, and anger. 

1773 In the passions, as movements of the sensitive appetite, there is 
neither moral good nor evil. But insofar as they engage reason and will, 
there is moral good or evil in them. 

1774 Emotions and feelings can be taken up in the virtues or perverted 
by the vices. 

1775 The perfection of the moral good consists in man's being moved 
to the good not only by his will but also by his "heart."

Article 6 MORAL CONSCIENCE 

1776 "Deep within his conscience man discovers a law which he has 
not laid upon himself but which he must obey. Its voice, ever calling 
him to love and to do what is good and to avoid evil, sounds in his 
heart at the right moment.... For man has in his heart a law inscribed 
by God.... His conscience is man's most secret core and his sanctuary. 
There he is alone with God whose voice echoes in his depths."47

Article 6 MORAL CONSCIENCE 

 

 

I. The Judgment of Conscience 

1777 Moral conscience,48 present at the heart of the person, enjoins 
him at the appropriate moment to do good and to avoid evil. It also 
judges particular choices, approving those that are good and 
denouncing those that are evil.49 It bears witness to the authority of 
truth in reference to the supreme Good to which the human person is 
drawn, and it welcomes the commandments. When he listens to his 
conscience, the prudent man can hear God speaking. 

1778 Conscience is a judgment of reason whereby the human person 
recognizes the moral quality of a concrete act that he is going to 
perform, is in the process of performing, or has already completed. In 
all he says and does, man is obliged to follow faithfully what he knows 
to be just and right. It is by the judgment of his conscience that man 
perceives and recognizes the prescriptions of the divine law: 

Conscience is a law of the mind; yet [Christians] would not grant that 
it is nothing more; I mean that it was not a dictate, nor conveyed the 



notion of responsibility, of duty, of a threat and a promise.... 
[Conscience] is a messenger of him, who, both in nature and in grace, 
speaks to us behind a veil, and teaches and rules us by his 
representatives. Conscience is the aboriginal Vicar of Christ.50 

1779 It is important for every person to be sufficiently present to 
himself in order to hear and follow the voice of his conscience. This 
requirement of interiority is all the more necessary as life often 
distracts us from any reflection, self-examination or introspection: 

Return to your conscience, question it.... Turn inward, brethren, and in 
everything you do, see God as your witness.51 

1780 The dignity of the human person implies and requires 
uprightness of moral conscience. Conscience includes the perception 
of the principles of morality (synderesis); their application in the given 
circumstances by practical discernment of reasons and goods; and 
finally judgment about concrete acts yet to be performed or already 
performed. the truth about the moral good, stated in the law of reason, 
is recognized practically and concretely by the prudent judgment of 
conscience. We call that man prudent who chooses in conformity with 
this judgment. 

1781 Conscience enables one to assume responsibility for the acts 
performed. If man commits evil, the just judgment of conscience can 
remain within him as the witness to the universal truth of the good, at 
the same time as the evil of his particular choice. the verdict of the 
judgment of conscience remains a pledge of hope and mercy. In 
attesting to the fault committed, it calls to mind the forgiveness that 
must be asked, the good that must still be practiced, and the virtue that 
must be constantly cultivated with the grace of God: 

We shall . . . reassure our hearts before him whenever our hearts 
condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows 
everything.52 

1782 Man has the right to act in conscience and in freedom so as 
personally to make moral decisions. "He must not be forced to act 
contrary to his conscience. Nor must he be prevented from acting 
according to his conscience, especially in religious matters."53

II. The Formation of Conscience 

1783 Conscience must be informed and moral judgment enlightened. 
A well-formed conscience is upright and truthful. It formulates its 
judgments according to reason, in conformity with the true good 
willed by the wisdom of the Creator. the education of conscience is 
indispensable for human beings who are subjected to negative 
influences and tempted by sin to prefer their own judgment and to 
reject authoritative teachings. 

1784 The education of the conscience is a lifelong task. From the 
earliest years, it awakens the child to the knowledge and practice of the 



interior law recognized by conscience. Prudent education teaches 
virtue; it prevents or cures fear, selfishness and pride, resentment 
arising from guilt, and feelings of complacency, born of human 
weakness and faults. the education of the conscience guarantees 
freedom and engenders peace of heart. 

1785 In the formation of conscience the Word of God is the light for 
our path,54 we must assimilate it in faith and prayer and put it into 
practice. We must also examine our conscience before the Lord's Cross. 
We are assisted by the gifts of the Holy Spirit, aided by the witness or 
advice of others and guided by the authoritative teaching of the 
Church.55

III. To Choose in Accord With Conscience 

1786 Faced with a moral choice, conscience can make either a right 
judgment in accordance with reason and the divine law or, on the 
contrary, an erroneous judgment that departs from them. 

1787 Man is sometimes confronted by situations that make moral 
judgments less assured and decision difficult. But he must always 
seriously seek what is right and good and discern the will of God 
expressed in divine law. 

1788 To this purpose, man strives to interpret the data of experience 
and the signs of the times assisted by the virtue of prudence, by the 
advice of competent people, and by the help of the Holy Spirit and his 
gifts. 

1789 Some rules apply in every case:  

- One may never do evil so that good may result from it;  



- the Golden Rule: "Whatever you wish that men would do to you, do 
so to them."56  

- charity always proceeds by way of respect for one's neighbor and his 
conscience: "Thus sinning against your brethren and wounding their 
conscience . . . you sin against Christ."57 Therefore "it is right not to . . 
. do anything that makes your brother stumble."58

IV. Erroneous Judgment 

1790 A human being must always obey the certain judgment of his 
conscience. If he were deliberately to act against it, he would condemn 
himself. Yet it can happen that moral conscience remains in ignorance 
and makes erroneous judgments about acts to be performed or already 
committed. 

1791 This ignorance can often be imputed to personal responsibility. 
This is the case when a man "takes little trouble to find out what is 
true and good, or when conscience is by degrees almost blinded 
through the habit of committing sin."59 In such cases, the person is 
culpable for the evil he commits. 

1792 Ignorance of Christ and his Gospel, bad example given by others, 
enslavement to one's passions, assertion of a mistaken notion of 
autonomy of conscience, rejection of the Church's authority and her 
teaching, lack of conversion and of charity: these can be at the source 
of errors of judgment in moral conduct. 

1793 If - on the contrary - the ignorance is invincible, or the moral 
subject is not responsible for his erroneous judgment, the evil 



committed by the person cannot be imputed to him. It remains no less 
an evil, a privation, a disorder. One must therefore work to correct the 
errors of moral conscience. 

1794 A good and pure conscience is enlightened by true faith, for 
charity proceeds at the same time "from a pure heart and a good 
conscience and sincere faith."60 

The more a correct conscience prevails, the more do persons and 
groups turn aside from blind choice and try to be guided by objective 
standards of moral conduct.61

1796 Conscience is a judgment of reason by which the human person 
recognizes the moral quality of a concrete act. 

1797 For the man who has committed evil, the verdict of his 
conscience remains a pledge of conversion and of hope. 

1798 A well-formed conscience is upright and truthful. It formulates 
its judgments according to reason, in conformity with the true good 
willed by the wisdom of the Creator. Everyone must avail himself of 
the means to form his conscience. 



1799 Faced with a moral choice, conscience can make either a right 
judgment in accordance with reason and the divine law or, on the 
contrary, an erroneous judgment that departs from them. 

1800 A human being must always obey the certain judgment of his 
conscience. 

1801 Conscience can remain in ignorance or make erroneous 
judgments. Such ignorance and errors are not always free of guilt.

is formed.

1803 "Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, 
whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if there is any 
excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these 
things."62  

A virtue is an habitual and firm disposition to do the good. It allows 
the person not only to perform good acts, but to give the best of 
himself. the virtuous person tends toward the good with all his sensory 
and spiritual powers; he pursues the good and chooses it in concrete 
actions. 

The goal of a virtuous life is to become like God.63

Article 7 THE VIRTUES 

 

 

I. The Human Virtues 

1804 Human virtues are firm attitudes, stable dispositions, habitual 
perfections of intellect and will that govern our actions, order our 
passions, and guide our conduct according to reason and faith. They 
make possible ease, self-mastery, and joy in leading a morally good life. 
the virtuous man is he who freely practices the good.  

The moral virtues are acquired by human effort. They are the fruit and 
seed of morally good acts; they dispose all the powers of the human 
being for communion with divine love. 

The cardinal virtues 

1805 Four virtues play a pivotal role and accordingly are called 
"cardinal"; all the others are grouped around them. They are: 



prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. "If anyone loves 
righteousness, [Wisdom's] labors are virtues; for she teaches 
temperance and prudence, justice, and courage."64 These virtues are 
praised under other names in many passages of Scripture. 

1806 Prudence is the virtue that disposes practical reason to discern 
our true good in every circumstance and to choose the right means of 
achieving it; "the prudent man looks where he is going."65 "Keep sane 
and sober for your prayers."66 Prudence is "right reason in action," 
writes St. Thomas Aquinas, following Aristotle.67 It is not to be 
confused with timidity or fear, nor with duplicity or dissimulation. It is 
called auriga virtutum (the charioteer of the virtues); it guides the 
other virtues by setting rule and measure. It is prudence that 
immediately guides the judgment of conscience. the prudent man 
determines and directs his conduct in accordance with this judgment. 
With the help of this virtue we apply moral principles to particular 
cases without error and overcome doubts about the good to achieve 
and the evil to avoid. 

1807 Justice is the moral virtue that consists in the constant and firm 
will to give their due to God and neighbor. Justice toward God is called 
the "virtue of religion." Justice toward men disposes one to respect the 
rights of each and to establish in human relationships the harmony that 
promotes equity with regard to persons and to the common good. the 
just man, often mentioned in the Sacred Scriptures, is distinguished by 
habitual right thinking and the uprightness of his conduct toward his 
neighbor. "You shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great, but 
in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor."68 "Masters, treat your 
slaves justly and fairly, knowing that you also have a Master in 
heaven."69 

1808 Fortitude is the moral virtue that ensures firmness in difficulties 
and constancy in the pursuit of the good. It strengthens the resolve to 
resist temptations and to overcome obstacles in the moral life. the 
virtue of fortitude enables one to conquer fear, even fear of death, and 
to face trials and persecutions. It disposes one even to renounce and 
sacrifice his life in defense of a just cause. "The Lord is my strength 
and my song."70 "In the world you have tribulation; but be of good 
cheer, I have overcome the world."71 



1809 Temperance is the moral virtue that moderates the attraction of 
pleasures and provides balance in the use of created goods. It ensures 
the will's mastery over instincts and keeps desires within the limits of 
what is honorable. the temperate person directs the sensitive appetites 
toward what is good and maintains a healthy discretion: "Do not follow 
your inclination and strength, walking according to the desires of your 
heart."72 Temperance is often praised in the Old Testament: "Do not 
follow your base desires, but restrain your appetites."73 In the New 
Testament it is called "moderation" or "sobriety." We ought "to live 
sober, upright, and godly lives in this world."74 

To live well is nothing other than to love God with all one's heart, with 
all one's soul and with all one's efforts; from this it comes about that 
love is kept whole and uncorrupted (through temperance). No 
misfortune can disturb it (and this is fortitude). It obeys only (God) 
(and this is justice), and is careful in discerning things, so as not to be 
surprised by deceit or trickery (and this is prudence).75 

The virtues and grace 

1810 Human virtues acquired by education, by deliberate acts and by 
a perseverance ever-renewed in repeated efforts are purified and 
elevated by divine grace. With God's help, they forge character and give 
facility in the practice of the good. the virtuous man is happy to 
practice them. 

1811 It is not easy for man, wounded by sin, to maintain moral 
balance. Christ's gift of salvation offers us the grace necessary to 
persevere in the pursuit of the virtues. Everyone should always ask for 
this grace of light and strength, frequent the sacraments, cooperate 
with the Holy Spirit, and follow his calls to love what is good and shun 
evil.

Article 7 THE VIRTUES 

 

 

II. The Theological Virtues 

1812 The human virtues are rooted in the theological virtues, which 
adapt man's faculties for participation in the divine nature:76 for the 
theological virtues relate directly to God. They dispose Christians to 
live in a relationship with the Holy Trinity. They have the One and 
Triune God for their origin, motive, and object. 

1813 The theological virtues are the foundation of Christian moral 
activity; they animate it and give it its special character. They inform 
and give life to all the moral virtues. They are infused by God into the 
souls of the faithful to make them capable of acting as his children and 
of meriting eternal life. They are the pledge of the presence and action 
of the Holy Spirit in the faculties of the human being. There are three 
theological virtues: faith, hope, and charity.77 

Faith 

1814 Faith is the theological virtue by which we believe in God and 
believe all that he has said and revealed to us, and that Holy Church 
proposes for our belief, because he is truth itself. By faith "man freely 
commits his entire self to God."78 For this reason the believer seeks to 
know and do God's will. "The righteous shall live by faith." Living faith 
"work(s) through charity."79 

1815 The gift of faith remains in one who has not sinned against it.80 
But "faith apart from works is dead":81 when it is deprived of hope 
and love, faith does not fully unite the believer to Christ and does not 
make him a living member of his Body. 

1816 The disciple of Christ must not only keep the faith and live on it, 
but also profess it, confidently bear witness to it, and spread it: "All 
however must be prepared to confess Christ before men and to follow 
him along the way of the Cross, amidst the persecutions which the 
Church never lacks."82 Service of and witness to the faith are 
necessary for salvation: "So every one who acknowledges me before 



men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven; but 
whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who 
is in heaven."83 

Hope 

1817 Hope is the theological virtue by which we desire the kingdom of 
heaven and eternal life as our happiness, placing our trust in Christ's 
promises and relying not on our own strength, but on the help of the 
grace of the Holy Spirit. "Let us hold fast the confession of our hope 
without wavering, for he who promised is faithful."84 "The Holy Spirit 
. . . he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so 
that we might be justified by his grace and become heirs in hope of 
eternal life."85 

1818 The virtue of hope responds to the aspiration to happiness which 
God has placed in the heart of every man; it takes up the hopes that 
inspire men's activities and purifies them so as to order them to the 
Kingdom of heaven; it keeps man from discouragement; it sustains him 
during times of abandonment; it opens up his heart in expectation of 
eternal beatitude. Buoyed up by hope, he is preserved from selfishness 
and led to the happiness that flows from charity. 

1819 Christian hope takes up and fulfills the hope of the chosen 
people which has its origin and model in the hope of Abraham, who 
was blessed abundantly by the promises of God fulfilled in Isaac, and 
who was purified by the test of the sacrifice.86 "Hoping against hope, 
he believed, and thus became the father of many nations."87 

1820 Christian hope unfolds from the beginning of Jesus' preaching in 
the proclamation of the beatitudes. the beatitudes raise our hope 
toward heaven as the new Promised Land; they trace the path that 
leads through the trials that await the disciples of Jesus. But through 
the merits of Jesus Christ and of his Passion, God keeps us in the 
"hope that does not disappoint."88 Hope is the "sure and steadfast 
anchor of the soul . . . that enters . . . where Jesus has gone as a 
forerunner on our behalf."89 Hope is also a weapon that protects us in 
the struggle of salvation: "Let us . . . put on the breastplate of faith and 
charity, and for a helmet the hope of salvation."90 It affords us joy 
even under trial: "Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation."91 



Hope is expressed and nourished in prayer, especially in the Our 
Father, the summary of everything that hope leads us to desire. 

1821 We can therefore hope in the glory of heaven promised by God to 
those who love him and do his will.92 In every circumstance, each one 
of us should hope, with the grace of God, to persevere "to the end"93 
and to obtain the joy of heaven, as God's eternal reward for the good 
works accomplished with the grace of Christ. In hope, the Church 
prays for "all men to be saved."94 She longs to be united with Christ, 
her Bridegroom, in the glory of heaven: 

Hope, O my soul, hope. You know neither the day nor the hour. Watch 
carefully, for everything passes quickly, even though your impatience 
makes doubtful what is certain, and turns a very short time into a long 
one. Dream that the more you struggle, the more you prove the love 
that you bear your God, and the more you will rejoice one day with 
your Beloved, in a happiness and rapture that can never end.95 

Charity 

1822 Charity is the theological virtue by which we love God above all 
things for his own sake, and our neighbor as ourselves for the love of 
God. 

1823 Jesus makes charity the new commandment.96 By loving his own 
"to the end,"97 he makes manifest the Father's love which he receives. 
By loving one another, the disciples imitate the love of Jesus which they 
themselves receive. Whence Jesus says: "As the Father has loved me, so 
have I loved you; abide in my love." and again: "This is my 
commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you."98 

1824 Fruit of the Spirit and fullness of the Law, charity keeps the 
commandments of God and his Christ: "Abide in my love. If you keep 
my commandments, you will abide in my love."99 

1825 Christ died out of love for us, while we were still "enemies."100 
The Lord asks us to love as he does, even our enemies, to make 
ourselves the neighbor of those farthest away, and to love children and 
the poor as Christ himself.101 

The Apostle Paul has given an incomparable depiction of charity: 
"charity is patient and kind, charity is not jealous or boastful; it is not 



arrogant or rude. Charity does not insist on its own way; it is not 
irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the 
right. Charity bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, 
endures all things."102 

1826 "If I . . . have not charity," says the Apostle, "I am nothing." 
Whatever my privilege, service, or even virtue, "if I . . . have not charity, 
I gain nothing."103 Charity is superior to all the virtues. It is the first 
of the theological virtues: "So faith, hope, charity abide, these three. 
But the greatest of these is charity."104 

1827 The practice of all the virtues is animated and inspired by charity, 
which "binds everything together in perfect harmony";105 it is the 
form of the virtues; it articulates and orders them among themselves; it 
is the source and the goal of their Christian practice. Charity upholds 
and purifies our human ability to love, and raises it to the supernatural 
perfection of divine love. 

1828 The practice of the moral life animated by charity gives to the 
Christian the spiritual freedom of the children of God. He no longer 
stands before God as a slave, in servile fear, or as a mercenary looking 
for wages, but as a son responding to the love of him who "first loved 
us":106 

If we turn away from evil out of fear of punishment, we are in the 
position of slaves. If we pursue the enticement of wages, . . . we 
resemble mercenaries. Finally if we obey for the sake of the good itself 
and out of love for him who commands . . . we are in the position of 
children.107 

1829 The fruits of charity are joy, peace, and mercy; charity demands 
beneficence and fraternal correction; it is benevolence; it fosters 
reciprocity and remains disinterested and generous; it is friendship and 
communion:  

Love is itself the fulfillment of all our works. There is the goal; that is 
why we run: we run toward it, and once we reach it, in it we shall find 
rest.108

III. The Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit 

1830 The moral life of Christians is sustained by the gifts of the Holy 
Spirit. These are permanent dispositions which make man docile in 
following the promptings of the Holy Spirit. 

1831 The seven gifts of the Holy Spirit are wisdom, understanding, 
counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord. They belong 
in their fullness to Christ, Son of David.109 They complete and perfect 
the virtues of those who receive them. They make the faithful docile in 
readily obeying divine inspirations. 

Let your good spirit lead me on a level path.110 



For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God . . . If 
children, then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ.111 

1832 The fruits of the Spirit are perfections that the Holy Spirit forms 
in us as the first fruits of eternal glory. the tradition of the Church lists 
twelve of them: "charity, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, 
generosity, gentleness, faithfulness, modesty, self-control, chastity."112

Article 7 THE VIRTUES 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

1833 Virtue is a habitual and firm disposition to do good. 

1834 The human virtues are stable dispositions of the intellect and the 
will that govern our acts, order our passions, and guide our conduct in 
accordance with reason and faith. They can be grouped around the 
four cardinal virtues: prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. 

1835 Prudence disposes the practical reason to discern, in every 
circumstance, our true good and to choose the right means for 
achieving it. 

1836 Justice consists in the firm and constant will to give God and 
neighbor their due. 



1837 Fortitude ensures firmness in difficulties and constancy in the 
pursuit of the good. 

1838 Temperance moderates the attraction of the pleasures of the 
senses and provides balance in the use of created goods. 

1839 The moral virtues grow through education, deliberate acts, and 
perseverance in struggle. Divine grace purifies and elevates them. 

1840 The theological virtues dispose Christians to live in a relationship 
with the Holy Trinity. They have God for their origin, their motive, and 
their object - God known by faith, God hoped in and loved for his own 
sake. 

1841 There are three theological virtues: faith, hope, and charity. They 
inform all the moral virtues and give life to them. 

1842 By faith, we believe in God and believe all that he has revealed to 
us and that Holy Church proposes for our belief. 

1843 By hope we desire, and with steadfast trust await from God, 
eternal life and the graces to merit it. 

1844 By charity, we love God above all things and our neighbor as 
ourselves for love of God. Charity, the form of all the virtues, "binds 
everything together in perfect harmony" (Col 3:14). 

1845 The seven gifts of the Holy Spirit bestowed upon Christians are 
wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear 
of the Lord.

Article 8 SIN 

I. Mercy and Sin 

1846 The Gospel is the revelation in Jesus Christ of God's mercy to 
sinners.113 The angel announced to Joseph: "You shall call his name 
Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."114 The same is true 
of the Eucharist, the sacrament of redemption: "This is my blood of 
the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of 
sins."115 

1847 "God created us without us: but he did not will to save us 
without us."116 To receive his mercy, we must admit our faults. "If we 
say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If 
we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, and will forgive our sins and 
cleanse us from all unrighteousness."117 

1848 As St. Paul affirms, "Where sin increased, grace abounded all the 
more."118 But to do its work grace must uncover sin so as to convert 
our hearts and bestow on us "righteousness to eternal life through 
Jesus Christ ourLord."119 Like a physician who probes the wound 



before treating it, God, by his Word and by his Spirit, casts a living 
light on sin: 

Conversion requires convincing of sin; it includes the interior 
judgment of conscience, and this, being a proof of the action of the 
Spirit of truth in man's inmost being, becomes at the same time the 
start of a new grant of grace and love: "Receive the Holy Spirit." Thus 
in this "convincing concerning sin" we discover a double gift: the gift of 
the truth of conscience and the gift of the certainty of redemption. the 
Spirit of truth is the Consoler.120

II. The Definition of Sin 

1849 Sin is an offense against reason, truth, and right conscience; it is 
failure in genuine love for God and neighbor caused by a perverse 
attachment to certain goods. It wounds the nature of man and injures 
human solidarity. It has been defined as "an utterance, a deed, or a 
desire contrary to the eternal law."121 

1850 Sin is an offense against God: "Against you, you alone, have I 
sinned, and done that which is evil in your sight."122 Sin sets itself 
against God's love for us and turns our hearts away from it. Like the 
first sin, it is disobedience, a revolt against God through the will to 
become "like gods,"123 knowing and determining good and evil. Sin is 
thus "love of oneself even to contempt of God."124 In this proud self-
exaltation, sin is diametrically opposed to the obedience of Jesus, 
which achieves our salvation.125 

1851 It is precisely in the Passion, when the mercy of Christ is about 
to vanquish it, that sin most clearly manifests its violence and its many 
forms: unbelief, murderous hatred, shunning and mockery by the 
leaders and the people, Pilate's cowardice and the cruelty of the 
soldiers, Judas' betrayal - so bitter to Jesus, Peter's denial and the 
disciples' flight. However, at the very hour of darkness, the hour of the 
prince of this world,126 The sacrifice of Christ secretly becomes the 
source from which the forgiveness of our sins will pour forth 
inexhaustibly.

III. The Different Kinds of Sins 

1852 There are a great many kinds of sins. Scripture provides several 
lists of them. the Letter to the Galatians contrasts the works of the 
flesh with the fruit of the Spirit: "Now the works of the flesh are plain: 
fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, 
jealousy, anger, selfishness, dissension, factions, envy, drunkenness, 
carousing, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those 
who do such things shall not inherit the Kingdom of God."127 

1853 Sins can be distinguished according to their objects, as can every 
human act; or according to the virtues they oppose, by excess or 
defect; or according to the commandments they violate. They can also 
be classed according to whether they concern God, neighbor, or 
oneself; they can be divided into spiritual and carnal sins, or again as 
sins in thought, word, deed, or omission. the root of sin is in the heart 
of man, in his free will, according to the teaching of the Lord: "For out 
of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, 
false witness, slander. These are what defile a man."128 But in the 



heart also resides charity, the source of the good and pure works, 
which sin wounds.

IV. The Gravity of Sin: Mortal and Venial Sin 

1854 Sins are rightly evaluated according to their gravity. the 
distinction between mortal and venial sin, already evident in 
Scripture,129 became part of the tradition of the Church. It is 
corroborated by human experience. 

1855 Mortal sin destroys charity in the heart of man by a grave 
violation of God's law; it turns man away from God, who is his 
ultimate end and his beatitude, by preferring an inferior good to him.  

Venial sin allows charity to subsist, even though it offends and wounds 
it. 

1856 Mortal sin, by attacking the vital principle within us - that is, 
charity - necessitates a new initiative of God's mercy and a conversion 
of heart which is normally accomplished within the setting of the 
sacrament of reconciliation: 

When the will sets itself upon something that is of its nature 
incompatible with the charity that orients man toward his ultimate 
end, then the sin is mortal by its very object . . . whether it contradicts 
the love of God, such as blasphemy or perjury, or the love of neighbor, 
such as homicide or adultery.... But when the sinner's will is set upon 
something that of its nature involves a disorder, but is not opposed to 
the love of God and neighbor, such as thoughtless chatter or 
immoderate laughter and the like, such sins are venial.130 

1857 For a sin to be mortal, three conditions must together be met: 
"Mortal sin is sin whose object is grave matter and which is also 
committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent."131 



1858 Grave matter is specified by the Ten Commandments, 
corresponding to the answer of Jesus to the rich young man: "Do not 
kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, 
Do not defraud, Honor your father and your mother."132 The gravity 
of sins is more or less great: murder is graver than theft. One must also 
take into account who is wronged: violence against parents is in itself 
graver than violence against a stranger. 

1859 Mortal sin requires full knowledge and complete consent. It 
presupposes knowledge of the sinful character of the act, of its 
opposition to God's law. It also implies a consent sufficiently deliberate 
to be a personal choice. Feigned ignorance and hardness of heart133 
do not diminish, but rather increase, the voluntary character of a sin. 

1860 Unintentional ignorance can diminish or even remove the 
imputability of a grave offense. But no one is deemed to be ignorant of 
the principles of the moral law, which are written in the conscience of 
every man. the promptings of feelings and passions can also diminish 
the voluntary and free character of the offense, as can external 
pressures or pathological disorders. Sin committed through malice, by 
deliberate choice of evil, is the gravest. 

1861 Mortal sin is a radical possibility of human freedom, as is love 
itself. It results in the loss of charity and the privation of sanctifying 
grace, that is, of the state of grace. If it is not redeemed by repentance 
and God's forgiveness, it causes exclusion from Christ's kingdom and 
the eternal death of hell, for our freedom has the power to make 
choices for ever, with no turning back. However, although we can 
judge that an act is in itself a grave offense, we must entrust judgment 
of persons to the justice and mercy of God. 

1862 One commits venial sin when, in a less serious matter, he does 
not observe the standard prescribed by the moral law, or when he 
disobeys the moral law in a grave matter, but without full knowledge or 
without complete consent. 

1863 Venial sin weakens charity; it manifests a disordered affection for 
created goods; it impedes the soul's progress in the exercise of the 
virtues and the practice of the moral good; it merits temporal 
punishment. Deliberate and unrepented venial sin disposes us little by 



little to commit mortal sin. However venial sin does not break the 
covenant with God. With God's grace it is humanly reparable. "Venial 
sin does not deprive the sinner of sanctifying grace, friendship with 
God, charity, and consequently eternal happiness."134 

While he is in the flesh, man cannot help but have at least some light 
sins. But do not despise these sins which we call "light": if you take 
them for light when you weigh them, tremble when you count them. A 
number of light objects makes a great mass; a number of drops fills a 
river; a number of grains makes a heap. What then is our hope? Above 
all, confession.135 

1864 "Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven 
men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven."136 
There are no limits to the mercy of God, but anyone who deliberately 
refuses to accept his mercy by repenting, rejects the forgiveness of his 
sins and the salvation offered by the Holy Spirit.137 Such hardness of 
heart can lead to final impenitence and eternal loss.

Article 8 SIN 

 

 

V. The Proliferation of Sin 

1865 Sin creates a proclivity to sin; it engenders vice by repetition of 
the same acts. This results in perverse inclinations which cloud 
conscience and corrupt the concrete judgment of good and evil. Thus 
sin tends to reproduce itself and reinforce itself, but it cannot destroy 
the moral sense at its root. 

1866 Vices can be classified according to the virtues they oppose, or 
also be linked to the capital sins which Christian experience has 
distinguished, following St. John Cassian and St. Gregory the Great. 
They are called "capital" because they engender other sins, other 
vices.138 They are pride, avarice, envy, wrath, lust, gluttony, and sloth 
or acedia. 

1867 The catechetical tradition also recalls that there are "sins that cry 
to heaven": the blood of Abel,139 The sin of the Sodomites,140 The 
cry of the people oppressed in Egypt,141 The cry of the foreigner, the 
widow, and the orphan,142 injustice to the wage earner.143 



1868 Sin is a personal act. Moreover, we have a responsibility for the 
sins committed by others when we cooperate in them:  

- by participating directly and voluntarily in them;  

- by ordering, advising, praising, or approving them;  

- by not disclosing or not hindering them when we have an obligation 
to do so;  

- by protecting evil-doers. 

1869 Thus sin makes men accomplices of one another and causes 
concupiscence, violence, and injustice to reign among them. Sins give 
rise to social situations and institutions that are contrary to the divine 
goodness. "Structures of sin" are the expression and effect of personal 
sins. They lead their victims to do evil in their turn. In an analogous 
sense, they constitute a "social sin."144

Article 8 SIN 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

1870 "God has consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have 
mercy upon all" (Rom 11:32). 

1871 Sin is an utterance, a deed, or a desire contrary to the eternal law 
(St. Augustine, Faust 22: PL 42, 418). It is an offense against God. It 
rises up against God in a disobedience contrary to the obedience of 
Christ. 

1872 Sin is an act contrary to reason. It wounds man's nature and 
injures human solidarity. 

1873 The root of all sins lies in man's heart. the kinds and the gravity 
of sins are determined principally by their objects. 

1874 To choose deliberately - that is, both knowing it and willing it - 
something gravely contrary to the divine law and to the ultimate end of 
man is to commit a mortal sin. This destroys in us the charity without 
which eternal beatitude is impossible. Unrepented, it brings eternal 
death. 

1875 Venial sin constitutes a moral disorder that is reparable by 
charity, which it allows to subsist in us. 

1876 The repetition of sins - even venial ones - engenders vices, among 
which are the capital sins.

1877 The vocation of humanity is to show forth the image of God and 
to be transformed into the image of the Father's only Son. This 
vocation takes a personal form since each of us is called to enter into 
the divine beatitude; it also concerns the human community as a 
whole.

CHAPTER TWO THE HUMAN COMMUNION 

 

 

Article 1 THE PERSON AND SOCIETY 

I. The Communal Character of the Human Vocation 

1878 All men are called to the same end: God himself. There is a 
certain resemblance between the unity of the divine persons and the 
fraternity that men are to establish among themselves in truth and 
love.1 Love of neighbor is inseparable from love for God. 

1879 The human person needs to live in society. Society is not for him 
an extraneous addition but a requirement of his nature. Through the 
exchange with others, mutual service and dialogue with his brethren, 
man develops his potential; he thus responds to his vocation.2 

1880 A society is a group of persons bound together organically by a 
principle of unity that goes beyond each one of them. As an assembly 
that is at once visible and spiritual, a society endures through time: it 
gathers up the past and prepares for the future. By means of society, 
each man is established as an "heir" and receives certain "talents" that 
enrich his identity and whose fruits he must develop.3 He rightly owes 
loyalty to the communities of which he is part and respect to those in 
authority who have charge of the common good. 



1881 Each community is defined by its purpose and consequently 
obeys specific rules; but "the human person . . . is and ought to be the 
principle, the subject and the end of all social institutions."4 

1882 Certain societies, such as the family and the state, correspond 
more directly to the nature of man; they are necessary to him. To 
promote the participation of the greatest number in the life of a 
society, the creation of voluntary associations and institutions must be 
encouraged "on both national and international levels, which relate to 
economic and social goals, to cultural and recreational activities, to 
sport, to various professions, and to political affairs."5 This 
"socialization" also expresses the natural tendency for human beings to 
associate with one another for the sake of attaining objectives that 
exceed individual capacities. It develops the qualities of the person, 
especially the sense of initiative and responsibility, and helps guarantee 
his rights.6 

1883 Socialization also presents dangers. Excessive intervention by the 
state can threaten personal freedom and initiative. the teaching of the 
Church has elaborated the principle of subsidiarity, according to which 
"a community of a higher order should not interfere in the internal life 
of a community of a lower order, depriving the latter of its functions, 
but rather should support it in case of need and help to co-ordinate its 
activity with the activities of the rest of society, always with a view to 
the common good."7 

1884 God has not willed to reserve to himself all exercise of power. He 
entrusts to every creature the functions it is capable of performing, 
according to the capacities of its own nature. This mode of governance 
ought to be followed in social life. the way God acts in governing the 
world, which bears witness to such great regard for human freedom, 
should inspire the wisdom of those who govern human communities. 
They should behave as ministers of divine providence. 

1885 The principle of subsidiarity is opposed to all forms of 
collectivism. It sets limits for state intervention. It aims at harmonizing 
the relationships between individuals and societies. It tends toward the 
establishment of true international order.

Article 1 THE PERSON AND SOCIETY 

 

 

II. Conversion and Society 

1886 Society is essential to the fulfillment of the human vocation. To 
attain this aim, respect must be accorded to the just hierarchy of 
values, which "subordinates physical and instinctual dimensions to 
interior and spiritual ones:"8 

Human society must primarily be considered something pertaining to 
the spiritual. Through it, in the bright light of truth, men should share 



their knowledge, be able to exercise their rights and fulfill their 
obligations, be inspired to seek spiritual values; mutually derive 
genuine pleasure from the beautiful, of whatever order it be; always be 
readily disposed to pass on to others the best of their own cultural 
heritage; and eagerly strive to make their own the spiritual 
achievements of others. These benefits not only influence, but at the 
same time give aim and scope to all that has bearing on cultural 
expressions, economic, and social institutions, political movements and 
forms, laws, and all other structures by which society is outwardly 
established and constantly developed.9 

1887 The inversion of means and ends,10 which results in giving the 
value of ultimate end to what is only a means for attaining it, or in 
viewing persons as mere means to that end, engenders unjust 
structures which "make Christian conduct in keeping with the 
commandments of the divine Law-giver difficult and almost 
impossible."11 

1888 It is necessary, then, to appeal to the spiritual and moral 
capacities of the human person and to the permanent need for his 
inner conversion, so as to obtain social changes that will really serve 
him. the acknowledged priority of the conversion of heart in no way 
eliminates but on the contrary imposes the obligation of bringing the 
appropriate remedies to institutions and living conditions when they 
are an inducement to sin, so that they conform to the norms of justice 
and advance the good rather than hinder it.12 

1889 Without the help of grace, men would not know how "to discern 
the often narrow path between the cowardice which gives in to evil, 
and the violence which under the illusion of fighting evil only makes it 
worse."13 This is the path of charity, that is, of the love of God and of 
neighbor. Charity is the greatest social commandment. It respects 
others and their rights. It requires the practice of justice, and it alone 
makes us capable of it. Charity inspires a life of self-giving: "Whoever 
seeks to gain his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve 
it."14

Article 1 THE PERSON AND SOCIETY 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

1890 There is a certain resemblance between the unity of the divine 
persons and the fraternity that men ought to establish among 
themselves. 

1891 The human person needs life in society in order to develop in 
accordance with his nature. Certain societies, such as the family and 
the state, correspond more directly to the nature of man. 



1892 "The human person . . . is and ought to be the principle, the 
subject, and the object of every social organization" (GS 25 # 1). 

1893 Widespread participation in voluntary associations and 
institutions is to be encouraged. 

1894 In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, neither the state 
nor any larger society should substitute itself for the initiative and 
responsibility of individuals and intermediary bodies. 

1895 Society ought to promote the exercise of virtue, not obstruct it. It 
should be animated by a just hierarchy of values. 

1896 Where sin has perverted the social climate, it is necessary to call 
for the conversion of hearts and appeal to the grace of God. Charity 
urges just reforms. There is no solution to the social question apart 
from the Gospel (cf CA 3, 5).

Article 2 PARTICIPATION IN SOCIAL LIFE 

I. Authority 

1897 "Human society can be neither well-ordered nor prosperous 
unless it has some people invested with legitimate authority to preserve 
its institutions and to devote themselves as far as is necessary to work 
and care for the good of all."15  

By "authority" one means the quality by virtue of which persons or 
institutions make laws and give orders to men and expect obedience 
from them. 

1898 Every human community needs an authority to govern it.16 The 
foundation of such authority lies in human nature. It is necessary for 
the unity of the state. Its role is to ensure as far as possible the 
common good of the society. 

1899 The authority required by the moral order derives from God: 
"Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is 
no authority except from God, and those that exist have been 
instituted by God. Therefore he who resists the authorities resists what 
God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment."17 

1900 The duty of obedience requires all to give due honor to authority 
and to treat those who are charged to exercise it with respect, and, 
insofar as it is deserved, with gratitude and good-will. 

Pope St. Clement of Rome provides the Church's most ancient prayer 
for political authorities:18 "Grant to them, Lord, health, peace, 
concord, and stability, so that they may exercise without offense the 
sovereignty that you have given them. Master, heavenly King of the 
ages, you give glory, honor, and power over the things of earth to the 



sons of men. Direct, Lord, their counsel, following what is pleasing and 
acceptable in your sight, so that by exercising with devotion and in 
peace and gentleness the power that you have given to them, they may 
find favor with you."19 

1901 If authority belongs to the order established by God, "the choice 
of the political regime and the appointment of rulers are left to the free 
decision of the citizens."20  

The diversity of political regimes is morally acceptable, provided they 
serve the legitimate good of the communities that adopt them. 
Regimes whose nature is contrary to the natural law, to the public 
order, and to the fundamental rights of persons cannot achieve the 
common good of the nations on which they have been imposed. 

1902 Authority does not derive its moral legitimacy from itself. It must 
not behave in a despotic manner, but must act for the common good 
as a "moral force based on freedom and a sense of responsibility":21 

A human law has the character of law to the extent that it accords with 
right reason, and thus derives from the eternal law. Insofar as it falls 
short of right reason it is said to be an unjust law, and thus has not so 
much the nature of law as of a kind of violence.22 

1903 Authority is exercised legitimately only when it seeks the 
common good of the group concerned and if it employs morally licit 
means to attain it. If rulers were to enact unjust laws or take measures 
contrary to the moral order, such arrangements would not be binding 
in conscience. In such a case, "authority breaks down completely and 
results in shameful abuse."23 

1904 "It is preferable that each power be balanced by other powers and 
by other spheres of responsibility which keep it within proper bounds. 
This is the principle of the 'rule of law,' in which the law is sovereign 
and not the arbitrary will of men."

Article 2 PARTICIPATION IN SOCIAL LIFE 

 

 

II. The Common Good 



1905 In keeping with the social nature of man, the good of each 
individual is necessarily related to the common good, which in turn 
can be defined only in reference to the human person: 

Do not live entirely isolated, having retreated into yourselves, as if you 
were already justified, but gather instead to seek the common good 
together.25 

1906 By common good is to be understood "the sum total of social 
conditions which allow people, either as groups or as individuals, to 
reach their fulfillment more fully and more easily."26 The common 
good concerns the life of all. It calls for prudence from each, and even 
more from those who exercise the office of authority. It consists of 
three essential elements: 

1907 First, the common good presupposes respect for the person as 
such. In the name of the common good, public authorities are bound 
to respect the fundamental and inalienable rights of the human person. 
Society should permit each of its members to fulfill his vocation. In 
particular, the common good resides in the conditions for the exercise 
of the natural freedoms indispensable for the development of the 
human vocation, such as "the right to act according to a sound norm 
of conscience and to safeguard . . . privacy, and rightful freedom also in 
matters of religion."27 

1908 Second, the common good requires the social well-being and 
development of the group itself. Development is the epitome of all 
social duties. Certainly, it is the proper function of authority to 
arbitrate, in the name of the common good, between various particular 
interests; but it should make accessible to each what is needed to lead a 
truly human life: food, clothing, health, work, education and culture, 
suitable information, the right to establish a family, and so on.28 

1909 Finally, the common good requires peace, that is, the stability 
and security of a just order. It presupposes that authority should 
ensure by morally acceptable means the security of society and its 
members. It is the basis of the right to legitimate personal and 
collective defence. 

1910 Each human community possesses a common good which 
permits it to be recognized as such; it is in the political community that 



its most complete realization is found. It is the role of the state to 
defend and promote the common good of civil society, its citizens, and 
intermediate bodies. 

1911 Human interdependence is increasing and gradually spreading 
throughout the world. the unity of the human family, embracing 
people who enjoy equal natural dignity, implies a universal common 
good. This good calls for an organization of the community of nations 
able to "provide for the different needs of men; this will involve the 
sphere of social life to which belong questions of food, hygiene, 
education, . . . and certain situations arising here and there, as for 
example . . . alleviating the miseries of refugees dispersed throughout 
the world, and assisting migrants and their families."29 

1912 The common good is always oriented towards the progress of 
persons: "The order of things must be subordinate to the order of 
persons, and not the other way around."30 This order is founded on 
truth, built up in justice, and animated by love.

III. Responsibility and Participation 

1913 "Participation" is the voluntary and generous engagement of a 
person in social interchange. It is necessary that all participate, each 
according to his position and role, in promoting the common good. 
This obligation is inherent in the dignity of the human person. 

1914 Participation is achieved first of all by taking charge of the areas 
for which one assumes personal responsibility: by the care taken for the 
education of his family, by conscientious work, and so forth, man 
participates in the good of others and of society.31 

1915 As far as possible citizens should take an active part in public life. 
the manner of this participation may vary from one country or culture 
to another. "One must pay tribute to those nations whose systems 
permit the largest possible number of the citizens to take part in public 
life in a climate of genuine freedom."32 

1916 As with any ethical obligation, the participation of all in realizing 
the common good calls for a continually renewed conversion of the 
social partners. Fraud and other subterfuges, by which some people 
evade the constraints of the law and the prescriptions of societal 
obligation, must be firmly condemned because they are incompatible 
with the requirements of justice. Much care should be taken to 
promote institutions that improve the conditions of human life.33 

1917 It is incumbent on those who exercise authority to strengthen the 
values that inspire the confidence of the members of the group and 
encourage them to put themselves at the service of others. 
Participation begins with education and culture. "One is entitled to 
think that the future of humanity is in the hands of those who are 
capable of providing the generations to come with reasons for life and 
optimism."34

Article 2 PARTICIPATION IN SOCIAL LIFE 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

1918 "There is no authority except from God, and those authorities 
that exist have been instituted by God" (Rom 13:1). 

1919 Every human community needs an authority in order to endure 
and develop. 

1920 "The political community and public authority are based on 
human nature and therefore . . . belong to an order established by 
God" (GS 74 # 3). 

1921 Authority is exercised legitimately if it is committed to the 
common good of society. To attain this it must employ morally 
acceptable means. 

1922 The diversity of political regimes is legitimate, provided they 
contribute to the good of the community. 

1923 Political authority must be exercised within the limits of the 
moral order and must guarantee the conditions for the exercise of 
freedom. 



1924 The common good comprises "the sum total of social conditions 
which allow people, either as groups or as individuals, to reach their 
fulfillment more fully and more easily" (GS 26 1). 

1925 The common good consists of three essential elements: respect 
for and promotion of the fundamental rights of the person; prosperity, 
or the development of the spiritual and temporal goods of society; the 
peace and security of the group and of its members. 

1926 The dignity of the human person requires the pursuit of the 
common good. Everyone should be concerned to create and support 
institutions that improve the conditions of human life. 

1927 It is the role of the state to defend and promote the common 
good of civil society. the common good of the whole human family 
calls for an organization of society on the international level.

Article 3 SOCIAL JUSTICE 

1928 Society ensures social justice when it provides the conditions that 
allow associations or individuals to obtain what is their due, according 
to their nature and their vocation. Social justice is linked to the 
common good and the exercise of authority.

Article 3 SOCIAL JUSTICE 

 

 

I. Respect For the Human Person 

1929 Social justice can be obtained only in respecting the transcendent 
dignity of man. the person represents the ultimate end of society, 
which is ordered to him: 

What is at stake is the dignity of the human person, whose defense and 
promotion have been entrusted to us by the Creator, and to whom the 
men and women at every moment of history are strictly and 
responsibly in debt.35 

1930 Respect for the human person entails respect for the rights that 
flow from his dignity as a creature. These rights are prior to society and 
must be recognized by it. They are the basis of the moral legitimacy of 
every authority: by flouting them, or refusing to recognize them in its 
positive legislation, a society undermines its own moral legitimacy.36 If 
it does not respect them, authority can rely only on force or violence to 
obtain obedience from its subjects. It is the Church's role to remind 
men of good will of these rights and to distinguish them from 
unwarranted or false claims. 

1931 Respect for the human person proceeds by way of respect for the 
principle that "everyone should look upon his neighbor (without any 
exception) as 'another self,' above all bearing in mind his life and the 
means necessary for living it with dignity."37 No legislation could by 
itself do away with the fears, prejudices, and attitudes of pride and 
selfishness which obstruct the establishment of truly fraternal societies. 



Such behavior will cease only through the charity that finds in every 
man a "neighbor," a brother. 

1932 The duty of making oneself a neighbor to others and actively 
serving them becomes even more urgent when it involves the 
disadvantaged, in whatever area this may be. "As you did it to one of 
the least of these my brethren, you did it to me."38 

1933 This same duty extends to those who think or act differently from 
us. the teaching of Christ goes so far as to require the forgiveness of 
offenses. He extends the commandment of love, which is that of the 
New Law, to all enemies.39 Liberation in the spirit of the Gospel is 
incompatible with hatred of one's enemy as a person, but not with 
hatred of the evil that he does as an enemy.

Article 3 SOCIAL JUSTICE 

 

 

II. Equality and Differences Among Men 

1934 Created in the image of the one God and equally endowed with 
rational souls, all men have the same nature and the same origin. 
Redeemed by the sacrifice of Christ, all are called to participate in the 
same divine beatitude: all therefore enjoy an equal dignity. 



1935 The equality of men rests essentially on their dignity as persons 
and the rights that flow from it: 

Every form of social or cultural discrimination in fundamental 
personal rights on the grounds of sex, race, color, social conditions, 
language, or religion must be curbed and eradicated as incompatible 
with God's design.40 

1936 On coming into the world, man is not equipped with everything 
he needs for developing his bodily and spiritual life. He needs others. 
Differences appear tied to age, physical abilities, intellectual or moral 
aptitudes, the benefits derived from social commerce, and the 
distribution of wealth.41 The "talents" are not distributed equally.42 

1937 These differences belong to God's plan, who wills that each 
receive what he needs from others, and that those endowed with 
particular "talents" share the benefits with those who need them. These 
differences encourage and often oblige persons to practice generosity, 
kindness, and sharing of goods; they foster the mutual enrichment of 
cultures: 

I distribute the virtues quite diversely; I do not give all of them to each 
person, but some to one, some to others.... I shall give principally 
charity to one; justice to another; humility to this one, a living faith to 
that one.... and so I have given many gifts and graces, both spiritual 
and temporal, with such diversity that I have not given everything to 
one single person, so that you may be constrained to practice charity 
towards one another.... I have willed that one should need another and 
that all should be my ministers in distributing the graces and gifts they 
have received from me.43 

1938 There exist also sinful inequalities that affect millions of men and 
women. These are in open contradiction of the Gospel: 

Their equal dignity as persons demands that we strive for fairer and 
more humane conditions. Excessive economic and social disparity 
between individuals and peoples of the one human race is a source of 
scandal and militates against social justice, equity, human dignity, as 
well as social and international peace.44

III. Human Solidarity 

1939 The principle of solidarity, also articulated in terms of 
"friendship" or "social charity," is a direct demand of human and 
Christian brotherhood.45 

An error, "today abundantly widespread, is disregard for the law of 
human solidarity and charity, dictated and imposed both by our 
common origin and by the equality in rational nature of all men, 
whatever nation they belong to. This law is sealed by the sacrifice of 
redemption offered by Jesus Christ on the altar of the Cross to his 
heavenly Father, on behalf of sinful humanity."46 

1940 Solidarity is manifested in the first place by the distribution of 
goods and remuneration for work. It also presupposes the effort for a 
more just social order where tensions are better able to be reduced and 
conflicts more readily settled by negotiation. 



1941 Socio-economic problems can be resolved only with the help of 
all the forms of solidarity: solidarity of the poor among themselves, 
between rich and poor, of workers among themselves, between 
employers and employees in a business, solidarity among nations and 
peoples. International solidarity is a requirement of the moral order; 
world peace depends in part upon this. 

1942 The virtue of solidarity goes beyond material goods. In spreading 
the spiritual goods of the faith, the Church has promoted, and often 
opened new paths for, the development of temporal goods as well. and 
so throughout the centuries has the Lord's saying been verified: "Seek 
first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be 
yours as well":47 

For two thousand years this sentiment has lived and endured in the 
soul of the Church, impelling souls then and now to the heroic charity 
of monastic farmers, liberators of slaves, healers of the sick, and 
messengers of faith, civilization, and science to all generations and all 
peoples for the sake of creating the social conditions capable of offering 
to everyone possible a life worthy of man and of a Christian.48

IN BRIEF 

1943 Society ensures social justice by providing the conditions that 
allow associations and individuals to obtain their due. 

1944 Respect for the human person considers the other "another self." 
It presupposes respect for the fundamental rights that flow from the 
dignity intrinsic of the person. 

1945 The equality of men concerns their dignity as persons and the 
rights that flow from it. 

1946 The differences among persons belong to God's plan, who wills 
that we should need one another. These differences should encourage 
charity. 

1947 The equal dignity of human persons requires the effort to reduce 
excessive social and economic inequalities. It gives urgency to the 
elimination of sinful inequalities. 

1948 Solidarity is an eminently Christian virtue. It practices the 
sharing of spiritual goods even more than material ones.

Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for God is at 
work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.1

Article 1 THE MORAL LAW 

1950 The moral law is the work of divine Wisdom. Its biblical meaning 
can be defined as fatherly instruction, God's pedagogy. It prescribes for 
man the ways, the rules of conduct that lead to the promised beatitude; 
it proscribes the ways of evil which turn him away from God and his 
love. It is at once firm in its precepts and, in its promises, worthy of 
love. 

1951 Law is a rule of conduct enacted by competent authority for the 
sake of the common good. the moral law presupposes the rational 
order, established among creatures for their good and to serve their 
final end, by the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Creator. All law 
finds its first and ultimate truth in the eternal law. Law is declared and 
established by reason as a participation in the providence of the living 
God, Creator and Redeemer of all. "Such an ordinance of reason is 
what one calls law."2 

Alone among all animate beings, man can boast of having been 
counted worthy to receive a law from God: as an animal endowed with 
reason, capable of understanding and discernment, he is to govern his 
conduct by using his freedom and reason, in obedience to the One who 
has entrusted everything to him.3 

1952 There are different expressions of the moral law, all of them 
interrelated: eternal law - the source, in God, of all law; natural law; 
revealed law, comprising the Old Law and the New Law, or Law of the 



Gospel; finally, civil and ecclesiastical laws. 
 

1953 The moral law finds its fullness and its unity in Christ. Jesus 
Christ is in person the way of perfection. He is the end of the law, for 
only he teaches and bestows the justice of God: "For Christ is the end 
of the law, that every one who has faith may be justified."4

Article 1 THE MORAL LAW 

 

 

I. The Natural Moral Law 

1954 Man participates in the wisdom and goodness of the Creator 
who gives him mastery over his acts and the ability to govern himself 
with a view to the true and the good. 

The natural law expresses the original moral sense which enables man 
to discern by reason the good and the evil, the truth and the lie: 

The natural law is written and engraved in the soul of each and every 
man, because it is human reason ordaining him to do good and 
forbidding him to sin . . . But this command of human reason would 
not have the force of law if it were not the voice and interpreter of a 
higher reason to which our spirit and our freedom must be 
submitted.5 

1955 The "divine and natural" law6 shows man the way to follow so as 
to practice the good and attain his end. the natural law states the first 
and essential precepts which govern the moral life. It hinges upon the 
desire for God and submission to him, who is the source and judge of 
all that is good, as well as upon the sense that the other is one's equal. 



Its principal precepts are expressed in the Decalogue. This law is called 
"natural," not in reference to the nature of irrational beings, but 
because reason which decrees it properly belongs to human nature: 

Where then are these rules written, if not in the book of that light we 
call the truth? In it is written every just law; from it the law passes into 
the heart of the man who does justice, not that it migrates into it, but 
that it places its imprint on it, like a seal on a ring that passes onto wax, 
without leaving the ring.7 

The natural law is nothing other than the light of understanding placed 
in us by God; through it we know what we must do and what we must 
avoid. God has given this light or law at the creation.8 

1956 The natural law, present in the heart of each man and established 
by reason, is universal in its precepts and its authority extends to all 
men. It expresses the dignity of the person and determines the basis for 
his fundamental rights and duties: 

For there is a true law: right reason. It is in conformity with nature, is 
diffused among all men, and is immutable and eternal; its orders 
summon to duty; its prohibitions turn away from offense .... To replace 
it with a contrary law is a sacrilege; failure to apply even one of its 
provisions is forbidden; no one can abrogate it entirely.9 

1957 Application of the natural law varies greatly; it can demand 
reflection that takes account of various conditions of life according to 
places, times, and circumstances. Nevertheless, in the diversity of 
cultures, the natural law remains as a rule that binds men among 
themselves and imposes on them, beyond the inevitable differences, 
common principles. 

1958 The natural law is immutable and permanent throughout the 
variations of history;10 it subsists under the flux of ideas and customs 
and supports their progress. the rules that express it remain 
substantially valid. Even when it is rejected in its very principles, it 
cannot be destroyed or removed from the heart of man. It always rises 
again in the life of individuals and societies: 



Theft is surely punished by your law, O Lord, and by the law that is 
written in the human heart, the law that iniquity itself does not 
efface.11 

1959 The natural law, the Creator's very good work, provides the solid 
foundation on which man can build the structure of moral rules to 
guide his choices. It also provides the indispensable moral foundation 
for building the human community. Finally, it provides the necessary 
basis for the civil law with which it is connected, whether by a 
reflection that draws conclusions from its principles, or by additions of 
a positive and juridical nature. 

1960 The precepts of natural law are not perceived by everyone clearly 
and immediately. In the present situation sinful man needs grace and 
revelation so moral and religious truths may be known "by everyone 
with facility, with firm certainty and with no admixture of error."12 
The natural law provides revealed law and grace with a foundation 
prepared by God and in accordance with the work of the Spirit.

Article 1 THE MORAL LAW 

 

 

II. The Old Law 

1961 God, our Creator and Redeemer, chose Israel for himself to be 
his people and revealed his Law to them, thus preparing for the coming 
of Christ. the Law of Moses expresses many truths naturally accessible 
to reason. These are stated and authenticated within the covenant of 
salvation. 

1962 The Old Law is the first stage of revealed Law. Its moral 
prescriptions are summed up in the Ten Commandments. the precepts 
of the Decalogue lay the foundations for the vocation of man fashioned 
in the image of God; they prohibit what is contrary to the love of God 
and neighbor and prescribe what is essential to it. the Decalogue is a 
light offered to the conscience of every man to make God's call and 
ways known to him and to protect him against evil: 

God wrote on the tables of the Law what men did not read in their 
hearts.13 

1963 According to Christian tradition, the Law is holy, spiritual, and 
good,14 yet still imperfect. Like a tutor15 it shows what must be done, 
but does not of itself give the strength, the grace of the Spirit, to fulfill 
it. Because of sin, which it cannot remove, it remains a law of bondage. 
According to St. Paul, its special function is to denounce and disclose 
sin, which constitutes a "law of concupiscence" in the human heart.16 



However, the Law remains the first stage on the way to the kingdom. It 
prepares and disposes the chosen people and each Christian for 
conversion and faith in the Savior God. It provides a teaching which 
endures for ever, like the Word of God. 

1964 The Old Law is a preparation for the Gospel. "The Law is a 
pedagogy and a prophecy of things to come."17 It prophesies and 
presages the work of liberation from sin which will be fulfilled in 
Christ: it provides the New Testament with images, "types," and 
symbols for expressing the life according to the Spirit. Finally, the Law 
is completed by the teaching of the sapiential books and the prophets 
which set its course toward the New Covenant and the Kingdom of 
heaven. 

There were . . . under the regimen of the Old Covenant, people who 
possessed the charity and grace of the Holy Spirit and longed above all 
for the spiritual and eternal promises by which they were associated 
with the New Law. Conversely, there exist carnal men under the New 
Covenant still distanced from the perfection of the New Law: the fear 
of punishment and certain temporal promises have been necessary, 
even under the New Covenant, to incite them to virtuous works. In any 
case, even though the Old Law prescribed charity, it did not give the 
Holy Spirit, through whom "God's charity has been poured into our 
hearts."18

1965 The New Law or the Law of the Gospel is the perfection here on 
earth of the divine law, natural and revealed. It is the work of Christ 
and is expressed particularly in the Sermon on the Mount. It is also the 
work of the Holy Spirit and through him it becomes the interior law of 
charity: "I will establish a New Covenant with the house of Israel. . . . I 
will put my laws into their hands, and write them on their hearts, and I 
will be their God, and they shall be my people."19 

1966 The New Law is the grace of the Holy Spirit given to the faithful 
through faith in Christ. It works through charity; it uses the Sermon on 
the Mount to teach us what must be done and makes use of the 
sacraments to give us the grace to do it: 

If anyone should meditate with devotion and perspicacity on the 
sermon our Lord gave on the mount, as we read in the Gospel of Saint 
Matthew, he will doubtless find there . . . the perfect way of the 
Christian life.... This sermon contains ... all the precepts needed to 
shape one's life.20 

1967 The Law of the Gospel "fulfills," refines, surpasses, and leads the 
Old Law to its perfection.21 In the Beatitudes, the New Law fulfills 
the divine promises by elevating and orienting them toward the 
"kingdom of heaven." It is addressed to those open to accepting this 
new hope with faith - the poor, the humble, the afflicted, the pure of 
heart, those persecuted on account of Christ and so marks out the 
surprising ways of the Kingdom. 



1968 The Law of the Gospel fulfills the commandments of the Law. 
the Lord's Sermon on the Mount, far from abolishing or devaluing the 
moral prescriptions of the Old Law, releases their hidden potential and 
has new demands arise from them: it reveals their entire divine and 
human truth. It does not add new external precepts, but proceeds to 
reform the heart, the root of human acts, where man chooses between 
the pure and the impure,22 where faith, hope, and charity are formed 
and with them the other virtues. the Gospel thus brings the Law to its 
fullness through imitation of the perfection of the heavenly Father, 
through forgiveness of enemies and prayer for persecutors, in 
emulation of the divine generosity.23 

1969 The New Law practices the acts of religion: almsgiving, prayer 
and fasting, directing them to the "Father who sees in secret," in 
contrast with the desire to "be seen by men."24 Its prayer is the Our 
Father.25 

1970 The Law of the Gospel requires us to make the decisive choice 
between "the two ways" and to put into practice the words of the 
Lord.26 It is summed up in the Golden Rule, "Whatever you wish that 
men would do to you, do so to them; this is the law and the 
prophets."27  

The entire Law of the Gospel is contained in the "new commandment" 
of Jesus, to love one another as he has loved us.28 

1971 To the Lord's Sermon on the Mount it is fitting to add the moral 
catechesis of the apostolic teachings, such as Romans 12-15, 1 
Corinthians 12-13, Colossians 3-4, Ephesians 4-5, etc. This doctrine 
hands on the Lord's teaching with the authority of the apostles, 
particularly in the presentation of the virtues that flow from faith in 
Christ and are animated by charity, the principal gift of the Holy 
Spirit. "Let charity be genuine.... Love one another with brotherly 
affection.... Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant 
in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints, practice hospitality."29 
This catechesis also teaches us to deal with cases of conscience in the 
light of our relationship to Christ and to the Church.30 

1972 The New Law is called a law of love because it makes us act out 
of the love infused by the Holy Spirit, rather than from fear; a law of 



grace, because it confers the strength of grace to act, by means of faith 
and the sacraments; a law of freedom, because it sets us free from the 
ritual and juridical observances of the Old Law, inclines us to act 
spontaneously by the prompting of charity and, finally, lets us pass 
from the condition of a servant who "does not know what his master is 
doing" to that of a friend of Christ - "For all that I have heard from my 
Father I have made known to you" - or even to the status of son and 
heir.31 

1973 Besides its precepts, the New Law also includes the evangelical 
counsels. the traditional distinction between God's commandments 
and the evangelical counsels is drawn in relation to charity, the 
perfection of Christian life. the precepts are intended to remove 
whatever is incompatible with charity. the aim of the counsels is to 
remove whatever might hinder the development of charity, even if it is 
not contrary to it.32 

1974 The evangelical counsels manifest the living fullness of charity, 
which is never satisfied with not giving more. They attest its vitality and 
call forth our spiritual readiness. the perfection of the New Law 
consists essentially in the precepts of love of God and neighbor. the 
counsels point out the more direct ways, the readier means, and are to 
be practiced in keeping with the vocation of each: 

(God) does not want each person to keep all the counsels, but only 
those appropriate to the diversity of persons, times, opportunities, and 
strengths, as charity requires; for it is charity, as queen of all virtues, all 
commandments, all counsels, and, in short, of all laws and all Christian 
actions that gives to all of them their rank, order, time, and value.33

Article 1 THE MORAL LAW 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

1975 According to Scripture the Law is a fatherly instruction by God 
which prescribes for man the ways that lead to the promised beatitude, 
and proscribes the ways of evil. 

1976 "Law is an ordinance of reason for the common good, 
promulgated by the one who is in charge of the community" (St. 
Thomas Aquinas, STh I-II, 90, 4). 

1977 Christ is the end of the law (cf Rom 10:4); only he teaches and 
bestows the justice of God. 

1978 The natural law is a participation in God's wisdom and goodness 
by man formed in the image of his Creator. It expresses the dignity of 
the human person and forms the basis of his fundamental rights and 
duties. 

1979 The natural law is immutable, permanent throughout history. the 
rules that express it remain substantially valid. It is a necessary 
foundation for the erection of moral rules and civil law. 



1980 The Old Law is the first stage of revealed law. Its moral 
prescriptions are summed up in the Ten Commandments. 

1981 The Law of Moses contains many truths naturally accessible to 
reason. God has revealed them because men did not read them in their 
hearts. 

1982 The Old Law is a preparation for the Gospel. 

1983 The New Law is the grace of the Holy Spirit received by faith in 
Christ, operating through charity. It finds expression above all in the 
Lord's Sermon on the Mount and uses the sacraments to communicate 
grace to us. 

1984 The Law of the Gospel fulfills and surpasses the Old Law and 
brings it to perfection: its promises, through the Beatitudes of the 
Kingdom of heaven; its commandments, by reforming the heart, the 
root of human acts. 

1985 The New Law is a law of love, a law of grace, a law of freedom. 

1986 Besides its precepts the New Law includes the evangelical 
counsels. "The Church's holiness is fostered in a special way by the 
manifold counsels which the Lord proposes to his disciples in the 
Gospel" (LG 42 # 2).

CHAPTER THREE GOD'S SALVATION: LAW AND GRACE 

 

 

Article 2 GRACE AND JUSTIFICATION 

I. Justification 

1987 The grace of the Holy Spirit has the power to justify us, that is, to 
cleanse us from our sins and to communicate to us "the righteousness 
of God through faith in Jesus Christ" and through Baptism:34 

But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with 
him. For we know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die 
again; death no longer has dominion over him. the death he died he 
died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So you 
also must consider yourselves as dead to sin and alive to God in Christ 
Jesus.35 

1988 Through the power of the Holy Spirit we take part in Christ's 
Passion by dying to sin, and in his Resurrection by being born to a new 
life; we are members of his Body which is the Church, branches grafted 
onto the vine which is himself:36 

(God) gave himself to us through his Spirit. By the participation of the 
Spirit, we become communicants in the divine nature.... For this 
reason, those in whom the Spirit dwells are divinized.37 

1989 The first work of the grace of the Holy Spirit is conversion, 
effecting justification in accordance with Jesus' proclamation at the 



beginning of the Gospel: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at 
hand."38 Moved by grace, man turns toward God and away from sin, 
thus accepting forgiveness and righteousness from on high. 
"Justification is not only the remission of sins, but also the 
sanctification and renewal of the interior man.39 

1990 Justification detaches man from sin which contradicts the love of 
God, and purifies his heart of sin. Justification follows upon God's 
merciful initiative of offering forgiveness. It reconciles man with God. 
It frees from the enslavement to sin, and it heals. 

1991 Justification is at the same time the acceptance of God's 
righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ. Righteousness (or 
"justice") here means the rectitude of divine love. With justification, 
faith, hope, and charity are poured into our hearts, and obedience to 
the divine will is granted us. 

1992 Justification has been merited for us by the Passion of Christ who 
offered himself on the cross as a living victim, holy and pleasing to 
God, and whose blood has become the instrument of atonement for 
the sins of all men. Justification is conferred in Baptism, the sacrament 
of faith. It conforms us to the righteousness of God, who makes us 
inwardly just by the power of his mercy. Its purpose is the glory of God 
and of Christ, and the gift of eternal life:40 

But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from law, 
although the law and the prophets bear witness to it, the righteousness 
of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no 
distinction: since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 
they are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption which 
is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as an expiation by his blood, 
to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because 
in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins; it was to 
prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he 
justifies him who has faith in Jesus.41 

1993 Justification establishes cooperation between God's grace and 
man's freedom. On man's part it is expressed by the assent of faith to 
the Word of God, which invites him to conversion, and in the 



cooperation of charity with the prompting of the Holy Spirit who 
precedes and preserves his assent: 

When God touches man's heart through the illumination of the Holy 
Spirit, man himself is not inactive while receiving that inspiration, since 
he could reject it; and yet, without God's grace, he cannot by his own 
free will move himself toward justice in God's sight.42 

1994 Justification is the most excellent work of God's love made 
manifest in Christ Jesus and granted by the Holy Spirit. It is the 
opinion of St. Augustine that "the justification of the wicked is a 
greater work than the creation of heaven and earth," because "heaven 
and earth will pass away but the salvation and justification of the elect . 
. . will not pass away."43 He holds also that the justification of sinners 
surpasses the creation of the angels in justice, in that it bears witness to 
a greater mercy. 

1995 The Holy Spirit is the master of the interior life. By giving birth 
to the "inner man,"44 justification entails the sanctification of his 
whole being: 

Just as you once yielded your members to impurity and to greater and 
greater iniquity, so now yield your members to righteousness for 
sanctification.... But now that you have been set free from sin and have 
become slaves of God, the return you get is sanctification and its end, 
eternal life.45

Article 2 GRACE AND JUSTIFICATION 

 



 

II. Grace 

1996 Our justification comes from the grace of God. Grace is favor, 
the free and undeserved help that God gives us to respond to his call to 
become children of God, adoptive sons, partakers of the divine nature 
and of eternal life.46 

1997 Grace is a participation in the life of God. It introduces us into 
the intimacy of Trinitarian life: by Baptism the Christian participates in 
the grace of Christ, the Head of his Body. As an "adopted son" he can 
henceforth call God "Father," in union with the only Son. He receives 
the life of the Spirit who breathes charity into him and who forms the 
Church. 

1998 This vocation to eternal life is supernatural. It depends entirely 
on God's gratuitous initiative, for he alone can reveal and give himself. 
It surpasses the power of human intellect and will, as that of every 
other creature.47 

1999 The grace of Christ is the gratuitous gift that God makes to us of 
his own life, infused by the Holy Spirit into our soul to heal it of sin 
and to sanctify it. It is the sanctifying or deifying grace received in 
Baptism. It is in us the source of the work of sanctification:48 

Therefore if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has 
passed away, behold, the new has come. All this is from God, who 
through Christ reconciled us to himself.49 

2000 Sanctifying grace is an habitual gift, a stable and supernatural 
disposition that perfects the soul itself to enable it to live with God, to 
act by his love. Habitual grace, the permanent disposition to live and 
act in keeping with God's call, is distinguished from actual graces 
which refer to God's interventions, whether at the beginning of 
conversion or in the course of the work of sanctification. 

2001 The preparation of man for the reception of grace is already a 
work of grace. This latter is needed to arouse and sustain our 
collaboration in justification through faith, and in sanctification 
through charity. God brings to completion in us what he has begun, 



"since he who completes his work by cooperating with our will began 
by working so that we might will it:"50 

Indeed we also work, but we are only collaborating with God who 
works, for his mercy has gone before us. It has gone before us so that 
we may be healed, and follows us so that once healed, we may be given 
life; it goes before us so that we may be called, and follows us so that 
we may be glorified; it goes before us so that we may live devoutly, and 
follows us so that we may always live with God: for without him we can 
do nothing.51 

2002 God's free initiative demands man's free response, for God has 
created man in his image by conferring on him, along with freedom, 
the power to know him and love him. the soul only enters freely into 
the communion of love. God immediately touches and directly moves 
the heart of man. He has placed in man a longing for truth and 
goodness that only he can satisfy. the promises of "eternal life" 
respond, beyond all hope, to this desire: 

If at the end of your very good works . . ., you rested on the seventh 
day, it was to foretell by the voice of your book that at the end of our 
works, which are indeed "very good" since you have given them to us, 
we shall also rest in you on the sabbath of eternal life.52 

2003 Grace is first and foremost the gift of the Spirit who justifies and 
sanctifies us. But grace also includes the gifts that the Spirit grants us 
to associate us with his work, to enable us to collaborate in the 
salvation of others and in the growth of the Body of Christ, the 
Church. There are sacramental graces, gifts proper to the different 
sacraments. There are furthermore special graces, also called charisms 
after the Greek term used by St. Paul and meaning "favor," "gratuitous 
gift," "benefit."53 Whatever their character - sometimes it is 
extraordinary, such as the gift of miracles or of tongues - charisms are 
oriented toward sanctifying grace and are intended for the common 
good of the Church. They are at the service of charity which builds up 
the Church.54 

2004 Among the special graces ought to be mentioned the graces of 
state that accompany the exercise of the responsibilities of the 
Christian life and of the ministries within the Church: 



Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use 
them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith; if service, in our serving; 
he who teaches, in his teaching; he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he 
who contributes, in liberality; he who gives aid, with zeal; he who does 
acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.55 

2005 Since it belongs to the supernatural order, grace escapes our 
experience and cannot be known except by faith. We cannot therefore 
rely on our feelings or our works to conclude that we are justified and 
saved.56 However, according to the Lord's words "Thus you will know 
them by their fruits"57 - reflection on God's blessings in our life and in 
the lives of the saints offers us a guarantee that grace is at work in us 
and spurs us on to an ever greater faith and an attitude of trustful 
poverty. 

A pleasing illustration of this attitude is found in the reply of St. Joan 
of Arc to a question posed as a trap by her ecclesiastical judges: "Asked 
if she knew that she was in God's grace, she replied: 'If I am not, may it 
please God to put me in it; if I am, may it please God to keep me 
there.'"58

III. Merit 



You are glorified in the assembly of your Holy Ones, for in crowning 
their merits you are crowning your own gifts.59 

2006 The term "merit" refers in general to the recompense owed by a 
community or a society for the action of one of its members, 
experienced either as beneficial or harmful, deserving reward or 
punishment. Merit is relative to the virtue of justice, in conformity with 
the principle of equality which governs it. 

2007 With regard to God, there is no strict right to any merit on the 
part of man. Between God and us there is an immeasurable inequality, 
for we have received everything from him, our Creator. 

2008 The merit of man before God in the Christian life arises from the 
fact that God has freely chosen to associate man with the work of his 
grace. the fatherly action of God is first on his own initiative, and then 
follows man's free acting through his collaboration, so that the merit of 
good works is to be attributed in the first place to the grace of God, 
then to the faithful. Man's merit, moreover, itself is due to God, for his 
good actions proceed in Christ, from the predispositions and assistance 
given by the Holy Spirit. 

2009 Filial adoption, in making us partakers by grace in the divine 
nature, can bestow true merit on us as a result of God's gratuitous 
justice. This is our right by grace, the full right of love, making us "co-
heirs" with Christ and worthy of obtaining "the promised inheritance 
of eternal life."60 The merits of our good works are gifts of the divine 
goodness.61 "Grace has gone before us; now we are given what is 
due.... Our merits are God's gifts."62 

2010 Since the initiative belongs to God in the order of grace, no one 
can merit the initial grace of forgiveness and justification, at the 
beginning of conversion. Moved by the Holy Spirit and by charity, we 
can then merit for ourselves and for others the graces needed for our 
sanctification, for the increase of grace and charity, and for the 
attainment of eternal life. Even temporal goods like health and 
friendship can be merited in accordance with God's wisdom. These 
graces and goods are the object of Christian prayer. Prayer attends to 
the grace we need for meritorious actions. 



2011 The charity of Christ is the source in us of all our merits before 
God. Grace, by uniting us to Christ in active love, ensures the 
supernatural quality of our acts and consequently their merit before 
God and before men. the saints have always had a lively awareness that 
their merits were pure grace. 

After earth's exile, I hope to go and enjoy you in the fatherland, but I 
do not want to lay up merits for heaven. I want to work for your love 
alone.... In the evening of this life, I shall appear before you with empty 
hands, for I do not ask you, Lord, to count my works. All our justice is 
blemished in your eyes. I wish, then, to be clothed in your own justice 
and to receive from your love the eternal possession of yourself.63

IV. Christian Holiness 



2012 "We know that in everything God works for good with those who 
love him . . . For those whom he fore knew he also predestined to be 
conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the first-
born among many brethren. and those whom he predestined he also 
called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he 
justified he also glorified."64 

2013 "All Christians in any state or walk of life are called to the 
fullness of Christian life and to the perfection of charity."65 All are 
called to holiness: "Be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."66 

In order to reach this perfection the faithful should use the strength 
dealt out to them by Christ's gift, so that . . . doing the will of the 
Father in everything, they may wholeheartedly devote themselves to 
the glory of God and to the service of their neighbor. Thus the holiness 
of the People of God will grow in fruitful abundance, as is clearly 
shown in the history of the Church through the lives of so many 
saints.67 

2014 Spiritual progress tends toward ever more intimate union with 
Christ. This union is called "mystical" because it participates in the 
mystery of Christ through the sacraments - "the holy mysteries" - and, 
in him, in the mystery of the Holy Trinity. God calls us all to this 
intimate union with him, even if the special graces or extraordinary 
signs of this mystical life are granted only to some for the sake of 
manifesting the gratuitous gift given to all. 

2015 The way of perfection passes by way of the Cross. There is no 
holiness without renunciation and spiritual battle.68 Spiritual progress 
entails the ascesis and mortification that gradually lead to living in the 
peace and joy of the Beatitudes: 

He who climbs never stops going from beginning to beginning, 
through beginnings that have no end. He never stops desiring what he 
already knows.69 

2016 The children of our holy mother the Church rightly hope for the 
grace of final perseverance and the recompense of God their Father for 
the good works accomplished with his grace in communion with 
Jesus.70 Keeping the same rule of life, believers share the "blessed 
hope" of those whom the divine mercy gathers into the "holy city, the 



new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a 
bride adorned for her husband."71

Article 2 GRACE AND JUSTIFICATION 

 

 

IN BRIEF 



2017 The grace of the Holy Spirit confers upon us the righteousness of 
God. Uniting us by faith and Baptism to the Passion and Resurrection 
of Christ, the Spirit makes us sharers in his life. 

2018 Like conversion, justification has two aspects. Moved by grace, 
man turns toward God and away from sin, and so accepts forgiveness 
and righteousness from on high. 

2019 Justification includes the remission of sins, sanctification, and the 
renewal of the inner man. 

2020 Justification has been merited for us by the Passion of Christ. It 
is granted us through Baptism. It conforms us to the righteousness of 
God, who justifies us. It has for its goal the glory of God and of Christ, 
and the gift of eternal life. It is the most excellent work of God's mercy. 

2021 Grace is the help God gives us to respond to our vocation of 
becoming his adopted sons. It introduces us into the intimacy of the 
Trinitarian life. 

2022 The divine initiative in the work of grace precedes, prepares, and 
elicits the free response of man. Grace responds to the deepest 
yearnings of human freedom, calls freedom to cooperate with it, and 
perfects freedom. 

2023 Sanctifying grace is the gratuitous gift of his life that God makes 
to us; it is infused by the Holy Spirit into the soul to heal it of sin and 
to sanctify it. 

2024 Sanctifying grace makes us "pleasing to God." Charisms, special 
graces of the Holy Spirit, are oriented to sanctifying grace and are 
intended for the common good of the Church. God also acts through 
many actual graces, to be distinguished from habitual grace which is 
permanent in us. 

2025 We can have merit in God's sight only because of God's free plan 
to associate man with the work of his grace. Merit is to be ascribed in 
the first place to the grace of God, and secondly to man's 
collaboration. Man's merit is due to God. 

2026 The grace of the Holy Spirit can confer true merit on us, by 
virtue of our adoptive filiation, and in accordance with God's 



gratuitous justice. Charity is the principal source of merit in us before 
God. 

2027 No one can merit the initial grace which is at the origin of 
conversion. Moved by the Holy Spirit, we can merit for ourselves and 
for others all the graces needed to attain eternal life, as well as 
necessary temporal goods. 

2028 "All Christians . . . are called to the fullness of Christian life and 
to the perfection of charity" (LG 40 # 2). "Christian perfection has but 
one limit, that of having none" (St. Gregory of Nyssa, De vita Mos.: 
PG 44, 300D). 

2029 "If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take 
up his cross and follow me" (Mt 16:24).

Article 3 THE CHURCH, MOTHER AND TEACHER 

2030 It is in the Church, in communion with all the baptized, that the 
Christian fulfills his vocation. From the Church he receives the Word of 
God containing the teachings of "the law of Christ."72 From the 
Church he receives the grace of the sacraments that sustains him on 
the "way." From the Church he learns the example of holiness and 
recognizes its model and source in the all-holy Virgin Mary; he 
discerns it in the authentic witness of those who live it; he discovers it 
in the spiritual tradition and long history of the saints who have gone 
before him and whom the liturgy celebrates in the rhythms of the 
sanctoral cycle. 

2031 The moral life is spiritual worship. We "present (our) bodies as a 
living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God,"73 within the Body of 
Christ that we form and in communion with the offering of his 
Eucharist. In the liturgy and the celebration of the sacraments, prayer 
and teaching are conjoined with the grace of Christ to enlighten and 
nourish Christian activity. As does the whole of the Christian life, the 
moral life finds its source and summit in the Eucharistic sacrifice.

Article 3 THE CHURCH, MOTHER AND TEACHER 

 

 

I. Moral Life and the Magisterium of the Church 

2032 The Church, the "pillar and bulwark of the truth," "has received 
this solemn command of Christ from the apostles to announce the 



saving truth."74 "To the Church belongs the right always and 
everywhere to announce moral principles, including those pertaining 
to the social order, and to make judgments on any human affairs to the 
extent that they are required by the fundamental rights of the human 
person or the salvation of souls."75 

2033 The Magisterium of the Pastors of the Church in moral matters 
is ordinarily exercised in catechesis and preaching, with the help of the 
works of theologians and spiritual authors. Thus from generation to 
generation, under the aegis and vigilance of the pastors, the "deposit" 
of Christian moral teaching has been handed on, a deposit composed 
of a characteristic body of rules, commandments, and virtues 
proceeding from faith in Christ and animated by charity. Alongside the 
Creed and the Our Father, the basis for this catechesis has traditionally 
been the Decalogue which sets out the principles of moral life valid for 
all men. 

2034 The Roman Pontiff and the bishops are "authentic teachers, that 
is, teachers endowed with the authority of Christ, who preach the faith 
to the people entrusted to them, the faith to be believed and put into 
practice."76 The ordinary and universal Magisterium of the Pope and 
the bishops in communion with him teach the faithful the truth to 
believe, the charity to practice, the beatitude to hope for. 

2035 The supreme degree of participation in the authority of Christ is 
ensured by the charism of infallibility. This infallibility extends as far as 
does the deposit of divine Revelation; it also extends to all those 
elements of doctrine, including morals, without which the saving truths 
of the faith cannot be preserved, explained, or observed.77 

2036 The authority of the Magisterium extends also to the specific 
precepts of the natural law, because their observance, demanded by the 
Creator, is necessary for salvation. In recalling the prescriptions of the 
natural law, the Magisterium of the Church exercises an essential part 
of its prophetic office of proclaiming to men what they truly are and 
reminding them of what they should be before God.78 

2037 The law of God entrusted to the Church is taught to the faithful 
as the way of life and truth. the faithful therefore have the right to be 
instructed in the divine saving precepts that purify judgment and, with 



grace, heal wounded human reason.79 They have the duty of observing 
the constitutions and decrees conveyed by the legitimate authority of 
the Church. Even if they concern disciplinary matters, these 
determinations call for docility in charity. 

2038 In the work of teaching and applying Christian morality, the 
Church needs the dedication of pastors, the knowledge of theologians, 
and the contribution of all Christians and men of good will. Faith and 
the practice of the Gospel provide each person with an experience of 
life "in Christ," who enlightens him and makes him able to evaluate the 
divine and human realities according to the Spirit of God.80 Thus the 
Holy Spirit can use the humblest to enlighten the learned and those in 
the highest positions. 
 

2039 Ministries should be exercised in a spirit of fraternal service and 
dedication to the Church, in the name of the Lord.81 At the same time 
the conscience of each person should avoid confining itself to 
individualistic considerations in its moral judgments of the person's 
own acts. As far as possible conscience should take account of the good 
of all, as expressed in the moral law, natural and revealed, and 
consequently in the law of the Church and in the authoritative 
teaching of the Magisterium on moral questions. Personal conscience 
and reason should not be set in opposition to the moral law or the 
Magisterium of the Church. 

2040 Thus a true filial spirit toward the Church can develop among 
Christians. It is the normal flowering of the baptismal grace which has 
begotten us in the womb of the Church and made us members of the 
Body of Christ. In her motherly care, the Church grants us the mercy 
of God which prevails over all our sins and is especially at work in the 
sacrament of reconciliation. With a mother's foresight, she also lavishes 
on us day after day in her liturgy the nourishment of the Word and 
Eucharist of the Lord.

II. The Precepts of the Church 

2041 The precepts of the Church are set in the context of a moral life 
bound to and nourished by liturgical life. The obligatory character of 
these positive laws decreed by the pastoral authorities is meant to 
guarantee to the faithful the very necessary minimum in the spirit of 
prayer and moral effort, in the growth in love of God and neighbor: 

2042 The first precept (“You shall attend Mass on Sundays and on 
holy days of obligation and rest from servile labor.") requires the 
faithful to sanctify the day commemorating the Resurrection of the 



Lord as well as the principal feasts honoring the mysteries of the Lord, 
the Blessed Virgin Mary and the saints; in the first place, by participate 
in the Eucharistic celebration, in which the Christian community is 
gathered, and by resting from those works and activities which could 
impede such a sanctification of these days.82 

  

The second precept (“You shall confess your sins at least once a year.") 
ensures preparation for the Eucharist by the reception of the sacrament 
of reconciliation, which continues Baptism's work of conversion and 
forgiveness.83 

The third precept (“You shall receive the sacrament of the Eucharist at 
least during the Easter season.") guarantees as a minimum the 
reception of the Lord's Body and Blood in connection with the Paschal 
feasts, the origin and center of the Christian liturgy.84 

2043 The fourth precept (“You shall observe the days of fasting and 
abstinence established by the Church.") ensures the times of ascesis 
and penance which prepare us for the liturgical feasts and help us 
acquire mastery over our instincts and freedom of heart.85 

The fifth precept (“You shall help to provide for the needs of the 
Church.") ensures that the faithful are obliged to assist with the 
material needs of the Church, each according to his own ability.86 

The faithful also have the duty of providing for the material needs of 
the Church, each according to his abilities.87

III. Moral Life and Missionary Witness 

2044 The fidelity of the baptized is a primordial condition for the 
proclamation of the Gospel and for the Church's mission in the world. 
In order that the message of salvation can show the power of its truth 
and radiance before men, it must be authenticated by the witness of 
the life of Christians. "The witness of a Christian life and good works 
done in a supernatural spirit have great power to draw men to the faith 
and to God."88 

2045 Because they are members of the Body whose Head is Christ,89 
Christians contribute to building up the Church by the constancy of 
their convictions and their moral lives. the Church increases, grows, 
and develops through the holiness of her faithful, until "we all attain to 
the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to 
mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of 
Christ."90 

2046 By living with the mind of Christ, Christians hasten the coming 
of the Reign of God, "a kingdom of justice, love, and peace."91 They 
do not, for all that, abandon their earthly tasks; faithful to their master, 
they fulfill them with uprightness, patience, and love.

IN BRIEF 

2047 The moral life is a spiritual worship. Christian activity finds its 
nourishment in the liturgy and the celebration of the sacraments. 

2048 The precepts of the Church concern the moral and Christian life 
united with the liturgy and nourished by it. 

2049 The Magisterium of the Pastors of the Church in moral matters 
is ordinarily exercised in catechesis and preaching, on the basis of the 
Decalogue which states the principles of moral life valid for every man. 

2050 The Roman Pontiff and the bishops, as authentic teachers, 
preach to the People of God the faith which is to be believed and 
applied in moral life. It is also encumbent on them to pronounce on 
moral questions that fall within the natural law and reason. 

2051 The infallibility of the Magisterium of the Pastors extends to all 
the elements of doctrine, including 

moral doctrine, without which the saving truths of the faith cannot be 
preserved, expounded, or observed. 

The Ten Commandments 

Exodus 20 2-17 



I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, 
out of the house of bondage. 

You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself 
a graven image, or any likeness 

of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or 
that is in the water under the 

earth; you shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I the LORD 
your God am a jealous God, 

visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and 
the fourth generation of those 

who hate me, but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who 
love me and keep my 

commandments. 

You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain; for the 
LORD will not hold him guiltless 

who takes his name in vain. 

Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, 
and do all your work; but the 

seventh day is a sabbath to the LORD your God; in it you shall not do 
any work, you, or your son, or 

your daughter, your manservant or your maidservant or your cattle, or 
the sojourner who is within your 

gates; for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and 
all that is in them, and rested the 

seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed 
it. 

Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the 
land which the LORD your God 

gives you. 

You shall not kill. 



You shall not commit adultery. 

You shall not steal. 

You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. 

You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your 
neighbor's wife, or his manservant 

or his maidservant or his ox, or his ass, or anything that is your 
neighbor's. 

Deuteronomy 5:6-21 

I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt 
out of the house of bondage. 

You shall have no other gods before me . . . 

You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain . . . 

Observe the sabbath day, to keep it holy. . . 

Honor your father and your mother . . . 

You shall not kill. 

Neither shall you commit adultery. 

Neither shall you steal. 

Neither shall you bear false witness against your neighbor. 

Neither shall you covet your neighbor's wife . 

You shall not desire . . . anything that is your neighbor's. 

A Traditional Catechetical Formula 

1. I am the LORD your God: you shall not have strange Gods before 
me. 

2. You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain. 

3. Remember to keep holy the LORD'S Day. 

4. Honor your father and your mother. 

5. You shall not kill. 



6. You shall not commit adultery.

PART THREE: LIFE IN CHRIST 

 

 

SECTION TWO THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 

"Teacher, what must I do . . .?" 

2052 "Teacher, what good deed must I do, to have eternal life?" To the 
young man who asked this question, 

Jesus answers first by invoking the necessity to recognize God as the 
"One there is who is good," as the 

supreme Good and the source of all good. Then Jesus tells him: "If you 
would enter life, keep the 



commandments." and he cites for his questioner the precepts that 
concern love of neighbor: "You shall not 

kill, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not 
bear false witness, Honor your father 

and mother." Finally Jesus sums up these commandments positively: 
"You shall love your neighbor as 

yourself."1 

2053 To this first reply Jesus adds a second: "If you would be perfect, 
go, sell what you possess and give to the 

poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."2 
This reply does not do away with the 

first: following Jesus Christ involves keeping the Commandments. the 
Law has not been abolished,3 but 

rather man is invited to rediscover it in the person of his Master who is 
its perfect fulfillment. In the three 

synoptic Gospels, Jesus' call to the rich young man to follow him, in 
the obedience of a disciple and in the 

observance of the Commandments, is joined to the call to poverty and 
chastity.4 The evangelical counsels 

are inseparable from the Commandments. 

2054 Jesus acknowledged the Ten Commandments, but he also showed 
the power of the Spirit at work in 

their letter. He preached a "righteousness [which] exceeds that of the 
scribes and Pharisees"5 as well as that 

of the Gentiles.6 He unfolded all the demands of the Commandments. 
"You have heard that it was said to 

the men of old, 'You shall not kill.' . . . But I say to you that every one 
who is angry with his brother shall be 

liable to judgment."7 



2055 When someone asks him, "Which commandment in the Law is 
the greatest?"8 Jesus replies: "You 

shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, 
and with all your mind. This is the 

greatest and first commandment. and a second is like it: You shall love 
your neighbor as yourself. On these 

two commandments hang all the Law and the prophets."9 The 
Decalogue must be interpreted in light of 

this twofold yet single commandment of love, the fullness of the Law: 

  

the commandments: "You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, 
You shall not steal, You shall not covet," and any other commandment, 
are summed up in this sentence: "You shall love your neighbor as 
yourself." Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the 
fulfilling of the law.10 

The Decalogue in Sacred Scripture 

2056 The word "Decalogue" means literally "ten words."11 God 
revealed these "ten words" to his people 

on the holy mountain. They were written "with the finger of God,"12 
unlike the other commandments 

written by Moses.13 They are pre-eminently the words of God. They 
are handed on to us in the books of 

Exodus 14 and Deuteronomy.15 Beginning with the Old Testament, 
the sacred books refer to the "ten 

words,"16 but it is in the New Covenant in Jesus Christ that their full 
meaning will be revealed. 

2057 The Decalogue must first be understood in the context of the 
Exodus, God's great liberating event at 

the center of the Old Covenant. Whether formulated as negative 
commandments, prohibitions, or as 



positive precepts such as: "Honor your father and mother," the "ten 
words" point out the conditions of a life 

freed from the slavery of sin. the Decalogue is a path of life: 

If you love the LORD your God, by walking in his ways, and by 
keeping his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, then 
you shall live andmultiply.17 

This liberating power of the Decalogue appears, for example, in the 
commandment about the 

sabbath rest, directed also to foreigners and slaves: 

You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and 
the LORD your God brought you out thence with a mighty hand and 
an outstretched arm.18 

2058 The "ten words" sum up and proclaim God's law: "These words 
the Lord spoke to all your assembly at the mountain out of the midst 
of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud voice; and he 
added no more. and he wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave 
them to me."19 For this reason these two tables are called "the 
Testimony." In fact, they contain the terms of the covenant concluded 
between God and his people. These "tables of the Testimony" were to 
be deposited in "the ark."20 

2059 The "ten words" are pronounced by God in the midst of a 
theophany (“The LORD spoke with you face to face at the mountain, 
out of the midst of the fire."21). They belong to God's revelation of 
himself and his glory. the gift of the Commandments is the gift of God 
himself and his holy will. In making his will known, God reveals 
himself to his people. 

2060 The gift of the commandments and of the Law is part of the 
covenant God sealed with his own. In Exodus, the revelation of the 
"ten words" is granted between the proposal of the covenant 22 and its 
conclusion - after the people had committed themselves to "do" all that 
the Lord had said, and to "obey" it.23 The Decalogue is never handed 
on without first recalling the covenant (“The LORD our God made 

a covenant with us in Horeb.").24 



2061 The Commandments take on their full meaning within the 
covenant. According to Scripture, man's 

moral life has all its meaning in and through the covenant. the first of 
the "ten words" recalls that God loved 

his people first: 

Since there was a passing from the paradise of freedom to the slavery 
of this world, in punishment for sin, the first phrase of the Decalogue, 
the first word of God's commandments, bears on freedom "I am the 
LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the 
house of slavery."25 

2062 The Commandments properly so-called come in the second 
place: they express the implications of 

belonging to God through the establishment of the covenant. Moral 
existence is a response to the Lord's 

loving initiative. It is the acknowledgement and homage given to God 
and a worship of thanksgiving. It is 

cooperation with the plan God pursues in history. 

2063 The covenant and dialogue between God and man are also 
attested to by the fact that all the obligations 

are stated in the first person (“I am the Lord.") and addressed by God 
to another personal subject (“you"). In 

all God's commandments, the singular personal pronoun designates 
the recipient. God makes his will known 

to each person in particular, at the same time as he makes it known to 
the whole people: 

The Lord prescribed love towards God and taught justice towards 
neighbor, so that man would be neither unjust, nor unworthy of God. 
Thus, through the Decalogue, God prepared man to become his friend 
and to live in harmony with his neighbor.... the words of the Decalogue 
remain likewise for us Christians. Far from being abolished, they have 
received amplification and development from the fact of the coming of 
the Lord in the flesh.26 



The Decalogue in the Church's Tradition 

  

2064 In fidelity to Scripture and in conformity with the example of 
Jesus, the tradition of the Church has 

acknowledged the primordial importance and significance of the 
Decalogue. 

2065 Ever since St. Augustine, the Ten Commandments have occupied 
a predominant place in the catechesis of baptismal candidates and the 
faithful. In the fifteenth century, the custom arose of expressing the 
commandments of the Decalogue in rhymed formulae, easy to 
memorize and in positive form. They are still in use today. the 
catechisms of the Church have often expounded Christian morality by 
following the order of the Ten Commandments. 

2066 The division and numbering of the Commandments have varied 
in the course of history. the present catechism follows the division of 
the Commandments established by St. Augustine, which has become 
traditional in the Catholic Church. It is also that of the Lutheran 
confessions. the Greek Fathers worked out a slightly different division, 
which is found in the Orthodox Churches and Reformed communities. 

2067 The Ten Commandments state what is required in the love of 
God and love of neighbor. the first three concern love of God, and the 
other seven love of neighbor. 

As charity comprises the two commandments to which the Lord 
related the whole Law and the prophets . . . so the Ten 
Commandments were themselves given on two tablets. Three were 
written on one tablet and seven on the other.27 

2068 The Council of Trent teaches that the Ten Commandments are 
obligatory for Christians and that the 

justified man is still bound to keep them;28 The Second Vatican 
Council confirms: "The bishops, successors 

of the apostles, receive from the Lord . . . the mission of teaching all 
peoples, and of preaching the Gospel to 



every creature, so that all men may attain salvation through faith, 
Baptism and the observance of the 

Commandments."29 

The unity of the Decalogue 

2069 The Decalogue forms a coherent whole. Each "word" refers to 
each of the others and to all of them; they 

reciprocally condition one another. the two tables shed light on one 
another; they form an organic unity. 

To transgress one commandment is to infringe all the others.30 One 
cannot honor another person without 

blessing God his Creator. One cannot adore God without loving all 
men, his creatures. the Decalogue brings 

man's religious and social life into unity. 

The Decalogue ant the natural law 

2070 The Ten Commandments belong to God's revelation. At the same 
time they teach us the true humanity 

of man. They bring to light the essential duties, and therefore, 
indirectly, the fundamental rights inherent 

in the nature of the human person. the Decalogue contains a privileged 
expression of the natural law: 

From the beginning, God had implanted in the heart of man the 
precepts of the natural law. Then he was content to remind him of 
them. This was the Decalogue.31 

2071 The commandments of the Decalogue, although accessible to 
reason alone, have been revealed. To 

attain a complete and certain understanding of the requirements of the 
natural law, sinful humanity needed 

this revelation: 



A full explanation of the commandments of the Decalogue became 
necessary in the state of sin because the light of reason was obscured 
and the will had gone astray.32 

We know God's commandments through the 

divine revelation proposed to us in the Church, and through the voice 
of moral conscience. the obligation 

of the Decalogue 

2072 Since they express man's fundamental duties towards God and 
towards his neighbor, the Ten 

Commandments reveal, in their primordial content, grave obligations. 
They are fundamentally immutable, 

and they oblige always and everywhere. No one can dispense from 
them. the Ten Commandments are 

engraved by God in the human heart. 

2073 Obedience to the Commandments also implies obligations in 
matter which is, in itself, light. Thus 

abusive language is forbidden by the fifth commandment, but would 
be a grave offense only as a result of 

circumstances or the offender's intention. "Apart from me you can do 
nothing" 

2074 Jesus says: "I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in 
me, and I in him, he it is that bears 

much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing."33 The fruit 
referred to in this saying is the holiness of 

a life made fruitful by union with Christ. When we believe in Jesus 
Christ, partake of his mysteries, and keep 

his commandments, the Savior himself comes to love, in us, his Father 
and his brethren, our Father and our 

brethren. His person becomes, through the Spirit, the living and 
interior rule of our activity. "This is my 



commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you."34

PART THREE: LIFE IN CHRIST 

 

 

 

SECTION TWO THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

2075 "What good deed must I do, to have eternal life?" - "If you would 
enter into life, keep the 

commandments" (Mt 19:16-17). 

2076 By his life and by his preaching Jesus attested to the permanent 
validity of the Decalogue. 2077 The 

gift of the Decalogue is bestowed from within the covenant concluded 
by God with his people. God's 

commandments take on their true meaning in and through this 
covenant. 

2078 In fidelity to Scripture and in conformity with Jesus' example, the 
tradition of the Church has always 

acknowledged the primordial importance and significance of the 
Decalogue. 

2079 The Decalogue forms an organic unity in which each "word" or 
"commandment" refers to all the others 

taken together. To transgress one commandment is to infringe the 
whole Law (cf Jas 2:10-11). 



2080 The Decalogue contains a privileged expression of the natural 
law. It is made known to us by divine 

revelation and by human reason. 

2081 The Ten Commandments, in their fundamental content, state 
grave obligations. However, obedience 

to these precepts also implies obligations in matter which is, in itself, 
light. 

2082 What God commands he makes possible by his grace.

SECTION TWO THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 

 

 



CHAPTER ONE YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD 
WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND 
WITH ALL YOUR MIND 

2083 Jesus summed up man's duties toward God in this saying: "You 
shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, 
and with all your mind."1 This immediately echoes the solemn call: 
"Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God is one LORD."2  

God has loved us first. the love of the One God is recalled in the first 
of the "ten words." the commandments then make explicit the 
response of love that man is called to give to his God.

Article 1 THE FIRST COMMANDMENT 

I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, 
out of the house of bondage. You shall have no other gods before me. 
You shall not make for yourself a graven image, or any likeness of 
anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that 
is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them or 
serve them.3

you serve."4

CHAPTER ONE YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD 
WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND 
WITH ALL YOUR MIND 

 

 

 

Article 1 THE FIRST COMMANDMENT 

 

 

I. "You Shall Worship the Lord Your God and Him Only Shall You 
Serve" 



2084 God makes himself known by recalling his all-powerful loving, 
and liberating action in the history of the one he addresses: "I brought 
you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage." the first 
word contains the first commandment of the Law: "You shall fear the 
LORD your God; you shall serve him.... You shall not go after other 
gods."5 God's first call and just demand is that man accept him and 
worship him. 

2085 The one and true God first reveals his glory to Israel.6 The 
revelation of the vocation and truth of man is linked to the revelation 
of God. Man's vocation is to make God manifest by acting in 
conformity with his creation "in the image and likeness of God": 

There will never be another God, Trypho, and there has been no other 
since the world began . . . than he who made and ordered the universe. 
We do not think that our God is different from yours. He is the same 
who brought your fathers out of Egypt "by his powerful hand and his 
outstretched arm." We do not place our hope in some other god, for 
there is none, but in the same God as you do: the God of Abraham, 
Isaac and Jacob.7 

2086 "The first commandment embraces faith, hope, and charity. 
When we say 'God' we confess a constant, unchangeable being, always 
the same, faithful and just, without any evil. It follows that we must 
necessarily accept his words and have complete faith in him and 
acknowledge his authority. He is almighty, merciful, and infinitely 
beneficent. Who could not place all hope in him? Who could not love 
him when contemplating the treasures of goodness and love he has 
poured out on us? Hence the formula God employs in the Scripture at 
the beginning and end of his commandments: 'I am the LORD.'"8 

Faith 

2087 Our moral life has its source in faith in God who reveals his love 
to us. St. Paul speaks of the "obedience of faith"9 as our first 
obligation. He shows that "ignorance of God" is the principle and 
explanation of all moral deviations.10 Our duty toward God is to 
believe in him and to bear witness to him. 



2088 The first commandment requires us to nourish and protect our 
faith with prudence and vigilance, and to reject everything that is 
opposed to it. There are various ways of sinning against faith:  

Voluntary doubt about the faith disregards or refuses to hold as true 
what God has revealed and the Church proposes for belief. Involuntary 
doubt refers to hesitation in believing, difficulty in overcoming 
objections connected with the faith, or also anxiety aroused by its 
obscurity. If deliberately cultivated doubt can lead to spiritual 
blindness. 

2089 Incredulity is the neglect of revealed truth or the willful refusal to 
assent to it. "Heresy is the obstinate post-baptismal denial of some 
truth which must be believed with divine and catholic faith, or it is 
likewise an obstinate doubt concerning the same; apostasy is the total 
repudiation of the Christian faith; schism is the refusal of submission 
to the Roman Pontiff or of communion with the members of the 
Church subject to him."11 

Hope 

2090 When God reveals Himself and calls him, man cannot fully 
respond to the divine love by his own powers. He must hope that God 
will give him the capacity to love Him in return and to act in 
conformity with the commandments of charity. Hope is the confident 
expectation of divine blessing and the beatific vision of God; it is also 
the fear of offending God's love and of incurring punishment. 

2091 The first commandment is also concerned with sins against hope, 
namely, despair and presumption:  

By despair, man ceases to hope for his personal salvation from God, 
for help in attaining it or for the forgiveness of his sins. Despair is 
contrary to God's goodness, to his justice - for the Lord is faithful to 
his promises - and to his mercy. 

2092 There are two kinds of presumption. Either man presumes upon 
his own capacities, (hoping to be able to save himself without help 
from on high), or he presumes upon God's almighty power or his 
mercy (hoping to obtain his forgiveness without conversion and glory 
without merit). 



Charity 

2093 Faith in God's love encompasses the call and the obligation to 
respond with sincere love to divine charity. the first commandment 
enjoins us to love God above everything and all creatures for him and 
because of him.12 

2094 One can sin against God's love in various ways:  

- indifference neglects or refuses to reflect on divine charity; it fails to 
consider its prevenient goodness and denies its power.  

- ingratitude fails or refuses to acknowledge divine charity and to 
return him love for love.  

- lukewarmness is hesitation or negligence in responding to divine love; 
it can imply refusal to give oneself over to the prompting of charity.  

- acedia or spiritual sloth goes so far as to refuse the joy that comes 
from God and to be repelled by divine goodness.  

- hatred of God comes from pride. It is contrary to love of God, whose 
goodness it denies, and whom it presumes to curse as the one who 
forbids sins and inflicts punishments.

SECTION TWO THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 



 

 

 

CHAPTER ONE YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD 
WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND 
WITH ALL YOUR MIND 

 

 

 

Article 1 THE FIRST COMMANDMENT 

 

 

II. "Him Only Shall You Serve" 

2095 The theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity inform and 
give life to the moral virtues. Thus charity leads us to render to God 
what we as creatures owe him in all justice. the virtue of religion 
disposes us to have this attitude. 

Adoration 

2096 Adoration is the first act of the virtue of religion. To adore God is 
to acknowledge him as God, as the Creator and Savior, the Lord and 
Master of everything that exists, as infinite and merciful Love. "You 
shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve," says 
Jesus, citing Deuteronomy.13 

2097 To adore God is to acknowledge, in respect and absolute 
submission, the "nothingness of the creature" who would not exist but 
for God. To adore God is to praise and exalt him and to humble 
oneself, as Mary did in the Magnificat, confessing with gratitude that 
he has done great things and holy is his name.14 The worship of the 
one God sets man free from turning in on himself, from the slavery of 
sin and the idolatry of the world. 

Prayer 



2098 The acts of faith, hope, and charity enjoined by the first 
commandment are accomplished in prayer. Lifting up the mind toward 
God is an expression of our adoration of God: prayer of praise and 
thanksgiving, intercession and petition. Prayer is an indispensable 
condition for being able to obey God's commandments. " (We) ought 
always to pray and not lose heart."15 

Sacrifice 

2099 It is right to offer sacrifice to God as a sign of adoration and 
gratitude, supplication and communion: "Every action done so as to 
cling to God in communion of holiness, and thus achieve blessedness, 
is a true sacrifice."16 

2100 Outward sacrifice, to be genuine, must be the expression of 
spiritual sacrifice: "The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken 
spirit...."17 The prophets of the Old Covenant often denounced 
sacrifices that were not from the heart or not coupled with love of 
neighbor.18 Jesus recalls the words of the prophet Hosea: "I desire 
mercy, and not sacrifice."19 The only perfect sacrifice is the one that 
Christ offered on the cross as a total offering to the Father's love and 
for our salvation.20 By uniting ourselves with his sacrifice we can make 
our lives a sacrifice to God. 

Promises and vows 

2101 In many circumstances, the Christian is called to make promises 
to God. Baptism and Confirmation, Matrimony and Holy Orders 
always entail promises. Out of personal devotion, the Christian may 
also promise to God this action, that prayer, this alms-giving, that 
pilgrimage, and so forth. Fidelity to promises made to God is a sign of 
the respect owed to the divine majesty and of love for a faithful God. 

2102 "A vow is a deliberate and free promise made to God concerning 
a possible and better good which must be fulfilled by reason of the 
virtue of religion,"21 A vow is an act of devotion in which the 
Christian dedicates himself to God or promises him some good work. 
By fulfilling his vows he renders to God what has been promised and 
consecrated to Him. the Acts of the Apostles shows us St. Paul 
concerned to fulfill the vows he had made.22 



2103 The Church recognizes an exemplary value in the vows to 
practice the evangelical counsels:23 

Mother Church rejoices that she has within herself many men and 
women who pursue the Savior's self-emptying more closely and show it 
forth more clearly, by undertaking poverty with the freedom of the 
children of God, and renouncing their own will: they submit 
themselves to man for the sake of God, thus going beyond what is of 
precept in the matter of perfection, so as to conform themselves more 
fully to the obedient Christ.24  

The Church can, in certain cases and for proportionate reasons, 
dispense from vows and promises25  

The social duty of religion and the right to religious freedom 

2104 "All men are bound to seek the truth, especially in what concerns 
God and his Church, and to embrace it and hold on to it as they come 
to know it."26 This duty derives from "the very dignity of the human 
person."27 It does not contradict a "sincere respect" for different 
religions which frequently "reflect a ray of that truth which enlightens 
all men,"28 nor the requirement of charity, which urges Christians "to 
treat with love, prudence and patience those who are in error or 
ignorance with regard to the faith."29 

2105 The duty of offering God genuine worship concerns man both 
individually and socially. This is "the traditional Catholic teaching on 
the moral duty of individuals and societies toward the true religion and 
the one Church of Christ."30 By constantly evangelizing men, the 
Church works toward enabling them "to infuse the Christian spirit into 
the mentality and mores, laws and structures of the communities in 
which [they] live."31 The social duty of Christians is to respect and 
awaken in each man the love of the true and the good. It requires them 
to make known the worship of the one true religion which subsists in 
the Catholic and apostolic Church.32 Christians are called to be the 
light of the world. Thus, the Church shows forth the kingship of Christ 
over all creation and in particular over human societies.33 

2106 "Nobody may be forced to act against his convictions, nor is 
anyone to be restrained from acting in accordance with his conscience 
in religious matters in private or in public, alone or in association with 



others, within due limits."34 This right is based on the very nature of 
the human person, whose dignity enables him freely to assent to the 
divine truth which transcends the temporal order. For this reason it 
"continues to exist even in those who do not live up to their obligation 
of seeking the truth and adhering to it."35 

2107 "If because of the circumstances of a particular people special 
civil recognition is given to one religious community in the 
constitutional organization of a state, the right of all citizens and 
religious communities to religious freedom must be recognized and 
respected as well."36 

2108 The right to religious liberty is neither a moral license to adhere 
to error, nor a supposed right to error,37 but rather a natural right of 
the human person to civil liberty, i.e., immunity, within just limits, 
from external constraint in religious matters by political authorities. 
This natural right ought to be acknowledged in the juridical order of 
society in such a way that it constitutes a civil right.38 

2109 The right to religious liberty can of itself be neither unlimited nor 
limited only by a "public order" conceived in a positivist or naturalist 
manner.39 The "due limits" which are inherent in it must be 
determined for each social situation by political prudence, according to 
the requirements of the common good, and ratified by the civil 
authority in accordance with "legal principles which are in conformity 
with the objective moral order."40

SECTION TWO THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 

 

 

 

CHAPTER ONE YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD 
WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND 
WITH ALL YOUR MIND 

 

 

 

Article 1 THE FIRST COMMANDMENT 

 



 

III. "You Shall Have No Other Gods Before Me" 

2110 The first commandment forbids honoring gods other than the 
one Lord who has revealed himself to his people. It proscribes 
superstition and irreligion. Superstition in some sense represents a 
perverse excess of religion; irreligion is the vice contrary by defect to 
the virtue of religion. 

Superstition 

2111 Superstition is the deviation of religious feeling and of the 
practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer 
the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way 
magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute 
the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external 
performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand, is 
to fall into superstition.41 

Idolatry 

2112 The first commandment condemns polytheism. It requires man 
neither to believe in, nor to venerate, other divinities than the one true 
God. Scripture constantly recalls this rejection of "idols, (of) silver and 
gold, the work of men's hands. They have mouths, but do not speak; 
eyes, but do not see." These empty idols make their worshippers 
empty: "Those who make them are like them; so are all who trust in 
them."42 God, however, is the "living God"43 who gives life and 
intervenes in history. 

2113 Idolatry not only refers to false pagan worship. It remains a 
constant temptation to faith. Idolatry consists in divinizing what is not 
God. Man commits idolatry whenever he honors and reveres a creature 
in place of God, whether this be gods or demons (for example, 
satanism), power, pleasure, race, ancestors, the state, money, etc. Jesus 
says, "You cannot serve God and mammon."44 Many martyrs died for 
not adoring "the Beast"45 refusing even to simulate such worship. 
Idolatry rejects the unique Lordship of God; it is therefore 
incompatible with communion with God.46 



2114 Human life finds its unity in the adoration of the one God. the 
commandment to worship the Lord alone integrates man and saves 
him from an endless disintegration. Idolatry is a perversion of man's 
innate religious sense. An idolater is someone who "transfers his 
indestructible notion of God to anything other than God."47 

Divination and magic 

2115 God can reveal the future to his prophets or to other saints. Still, 
a sound Christian attitude consists in putting oneself confidently into 
the hands of Providence for whatever concerns the future, and giving 
up all unhealthy curiosity about it. Improvidence, however, can 
constitute a lack of responsibility. 

2116 All forms of divination are to be rejected: recourse to Satan or 
demons, conjuring up the dead or other practices falsely supposed to 
"unveil" the future.48 Consulting horoscopes, astrology, palm reading, 
interpretation of omens and lots, the phenomena of clairvoyance, and 
recourse to mediums all conceal a desire for power over time, history, 
and, in the last analysis, other human beings, as well as a wish to 
conciliate hidden powers. They contradict the honor, respect, and 
loving fear that we owe to God alone. 

2117 All practices of magic or sorcery, by which one attempts to tame 
occult powers, so as to place them at one's service and have a 
supernatural power over others - even if this were for the sake of 
restoring their health - are gravely contrary to the virtue of religion. 
These practices are even more to be condemned when accompanied 
by the intention of harming someone, or when they have recourse to 
the intervention of demons. Wearing charms is also reprehensible. 
Spiritism often implies divination or magical practices; the Church for 
her part warns the faithful against it. Recourse to so-called traditional 
cures does not justify either the invocation of evil powers or the 
exploitation of another's credulity. 

Irreligion 

2118 God's first commandment condemns the main sins of irreligion: 
tempting God, in words or deeds, sacrilege, and simony. 



2119 Tempting God consists in putting his goodness and almighty 
power to the test by word or deed. Thus Satan tried to induce Jesus to 
throw himself down from the Temple and, by this gesture, force God to 
act.49 Jesus opposed Satan with the word of God: "You shall not put 
the LORD your God to the test." 50 The challenge contained in such 
tempting of God wounds the respect and trust we owe our Creator and 
Lord. It always harbors doubt about his love, his providence, and his 
power.51 

2120 Sacrilege consists in profaning or treating unworthily the 
sacraments and other liturgical actions, as well as persons, things, or 
places consecrated to God. Sacrilege is a grave sin especially when 
committed against the Eucharist, for in this sacrament the true Body of 
Christ is made substantially present for us.52 

2121 Simony is defined as the buying or selling of spiritual things.53 
To Simon the magician, who wanted to buy the spiritual power he saw 
at work in the apostles, St. Peter responded: "Your silver perish with 
you, because you thought you could obtain God's gift with money!"54 
Peter thus held to the words of Jesus: "You received without pay, give 
without pay."55 It is impossible to appropriate to oneself spiritual 
goods and behave toward them as their owner or master, for they have 
their source in God. One can receive them only from him, without 
payment. 

2122 The minister should ask nothing for the administration of the 
sacraments beyond the offerings defined by the competent authority, 
always being careful that the needy are not deprived of the help of the 
sacraments because of their poverty."56 The competent authority 
determines these "offerings" in accordance with the principle that the 
Christian people ought to contribute to the support of the Church's 
ministers. "The laborer deserves his food."57 

Atheism 

2123 "Many . . . of our contemporaries either do not at all perceive, or 
explicitly reject, this intimate and vital bond of man to God. Atheism 
must therefore be regarded as one of the most serious problems of our 
time."58 



2124 The name "atheism" covers many very different phenomena. One 
common form is the practical materialism which restricts its needs and 
aspirations to space and time. Atheistic humanism falsely considers 
man to be "an end to himself, and the sole maker, with supreme 
control, of his own history."59 Another form of contemporary atheism 
looks for the liberation of man through economic and social liberation. 
"It holds that religion, of its very nature, thwarts such emancipation by 
raising man's hopes in a future life, thus both deceiving him and 
discouraging him from working for a better form of life on earth."60 

2125 Since it rejects or denies the existence of God, atheism is a sin 
against the virtue of religion.61 The imputability of this offense can be 
significantly diminished in virtue of the intentions and the 
circumstances. "Believers can have more than a little to do with the rise 
of atheism. To the extent that they are careless about their instruction 
in the faith, or present its teaching falsely, or even fail in their religious, 
moral, or social life, they must be said to conceal rather than to reveal 
the true nature of God and of religion."62 

2126 Atheism is often based on a false conception of human 
autonomy, exaggerated to the point of refusing any dependence on 
God.63 Yet, "to acknowledge God is in no way to oppose the dignity of 
man, since such dignity is grounded and brought to perfection in 
God...."64 "For the Church knows full well that her message is in 
harmony with the most secret desires of the human heart."65 

Agnosticism 

2127 Agnosticism assumes a number of forms. In certain cases the 
agnostic refrains from denying God; instead he postulates the existence 
of a transcendent being which is incapable of revealing itself, and 
about which nothing can be said. In other cases, the agnostic makes no 
judgment about God's existence, declaring it impossible to prove, or 
even to affirm or deny. 

2128 Agnosticism can sometimes include a certain search for God, but 
it can equally express indifferentism, a flight from the ultimate 
question of existence, and a sluggish moral conscience. Agnosticism is 
all too often equivalent to practical atheism.

Article 1 THE FIRST COMMANDMENT 

 

 

IV. "You Shall Not Make For Yourself a Graven Image . . ." 



2129 The divine injunction included the prohibition of every 
representation of God by the hand of man. Deuteronomy explains: 
"Since you saw no form on the day that the Lord spoke to you at 
Horeb out of the midst of the fire, beware lest you act corruptly by 
making a graven image for yourselves, in the form of any figure...."66 
It is the absolutely transcendent God who revealed himself to Israel. 
"He is the all," but at the same time "he is greater than all his 
works."67 He is "the author of beauty."68 

2130 Nevertheless, already in the Old Testament, God ordained or 
permitted the making of images that pointed symbolically toward 
salvation by the incarnate Word: so it was with the bronze serpent, the 
ark of the covenant, and the cherubim.69 

2131 Basing itself on the mystery of the incarnate Word, the seventh 
ecumenical council at Nicaea (787) justified against the iconoclasts the 
veneration of icons - of Christ, but also of the Mother of God, the 
angels, and all the saints. By becoming incarnate, the Son of God 
introduced a new "economy" of images. 

2132 The Christian veneration of images is not contrary to the first 
commandment which proscribes idols. Indeed, "the honor rendered to 
an image passes to its prototype," and "whoever venerates an image 
venerates the person portrayed in it."70 The honor paid to sacred 
images is a "respectful veneration," not the adoration due to God 
alone: 

Religious worship is not directed to images in themselves, considered 
as mere things, but under their distinctive aspect as images leading us 
on to God incarnate. the movement toward the image does not 
terminate in it as image, but tends toward that whose image it is.71

WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND

Article 1 THE FIRST COMMANDMENT 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

2133 "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with 
all your soul and with all your strength" (Deut 6:5). 

2134 The first commandment summons man to believe in God, to 
hope in him, and to love him above all else. 

2135 "You shall worship the Lord your God" (? Mt 4:10). Adoring 
God, praying to him, offering him the worship that belongs to him, 
fulfilling the promises and vows made to him are acts of the virtue of 
religion which fall under obedience to the first commandment. 

2136 The duty to offer God authentic worship concerns man both as 
an individual and as a social being. 

2137 "Men of the present day want to profess their religion freely in 
private and in public" (DH 15). 



2138 Superstition is a departure from the worship that we give to the 
true God. It is manifested in idolatry, as well as in various forms of 
divination and magic. 

2139 Tempting God in words or deeds, sacrilege, and simony are sins 
of irreligion forbidden by the first commandment. 

2140 Since it rejects or denies the existence of God, atheism is a sin 
against the first commandment. 

2141 The veneration of sacred images is based on the mystery of the 
Incarnation of the Word of God. It is not contrary to the first 
commandment.

I. The Name of the Lord is Holy 

2142 The second commandment prescribes respect for the Lord's 
name. Like the first commandment, it belongs to the virtue of religion 
and more particularly it governs our use of speech in sacred matters. 

2143 Among all the words of Revelation, there is one which is unique: 
the revealed name of God. God confides his name to those who believe 
in him; he reveals himself to them in his personal mystery. the gift of a 
name belongs to the order of trust and intimacy. "The Lord's name is 
holy." For this reason man must not abuse it. He must keep it in mind 
in silent, loving adoration. He will not introduce it into his own speech 
except to bless, praise, and glorify it.74 

2144 Respect for his name is an expression of the respect owed to the 
mystery of God himself and to the whole sacred reality it evokes. the 
sense of the sacred is part of the virtue of religion: 



Are these feelings of fear and awe Christian feelings or not? . . . I say 
this, then, which I think no one can reasonably dispute. They are the 
class of feelings we should have - yes, have to an intense degree - if we 
literally had the sight of Almighty God; therefore they are the class of 
feelings which we shall have, if we realize His presence. In proportion 
as we believe that He is present, we shall have them; and not to have 
them, is not to realize, not to believe that He is present.75 

2145 The faithful should bear witness to the Lord's name by 
confessing the faith without giving way to fear.76 Preaching and 
catechizing should be permeated with adoration and respect for the 
name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

2146 The second commandment forbids the abuse of God's name, i.e., 
every improper use of the names of God, Jesus Christ, but also of the 
Virgin Mary and all the saints. 

2147 Promises made to others in God's name engage the divine honor, 
fidelity, truthfulness, and authority. They must be respected in justice. 
To be unfaithful to them is to misuse God's name and in some way to 
make God out to be a liar.77 

2148 Blasphemy is directly opposed to the second commandment. It 
consists in uttering against God - inwardly or outwardly - words of 
hatred, reproach, or defiance; in speaking ill of God; in failing in 
respect toward him in one's speech; in misusing God's name. St. James 
condemns those "who blaspheme that honorable name [of Jesus] by 
which you are called."78 The prohibition of blasphemy extends to 
language against Christ's Church, the saints, and sacred things. It is 
also blasphemous to make use of God's name to cover up criminal 
practices, to reduce peoples to servitude, to torture persons or put 
them to death. the misuse of God's name to commit a crime can 
provoke others to repudiate religion.  

Blasphemy is contrary to the respect due God and his holy name. It is 
in itself a grave sin.79 

2149 Oaths which misuse God's name, though without the intention of 
blasphemy, show lack of respect for the Lord. the second 
commandment also forbids magical use of the divine name. 



[God's] name is great when spoken with respect for the greatness of his 
majesty. God's name is holy when said with veneration and fear of 
offending him.80

II. Taking the Name of the Lord in Vain 

2150 The second commandment forbids false oaths. Taking an oath or 
swearing is to take God as witness to what one affirms. It is to invoke 



the divine truthfulness as a pledge of one's own truthfulness. An oath 
engages the Lord's name. "You shall fear the LORD your God; you 
shall serve him, and swear by his name."81 

2151 Rejection of false oaths is a duty toward God. As Creator and 
Lord, God is the norm of all truth. Human speech is either in accord 
with or in opposition to God who is Truth itself. When it is truthful 
and legitimate, an oath highlights the relationship of human speech 
with God's truth. A false oath calls on God to be witness to a lie. 

2152 A person commits perjury when he makes a promise under oath 
with no intention of keeping it, or when after promising on oath he 
does not keep it. Perjury is a grave lack of respect for the Lord of all 
speech. Pledging oneself by oath to commit an evil deed is contrary to 
the holiness of the divine name. 

2153 In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus explained the second 
commandment: "You have heard that it was said to the men of old, 
'You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you 
have sworn.' But I say to you, Do not swear at all.... Let what you say 
be simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything more than this comes from the evil 
one."82 Jesus teaches that every oath involves a reference to God and 
that God's presence and his truth must be honored in all speech. 
Discretion in calling upon God is allied with a respectful awareness of 
his presence, which all our assertions either witness to or mock. 

2154 Following St. Paul,83 The tradition of the Church has 
understood Jesus' words as not excluding oaths made for grave and 
right reasons (for example, in court). "An oath, that is the invocation of 
the divine name as a witness to truth, cannot be taken unless in truth, 
in judgment, and in justice."84 

2155 The holiness of the divine name demands that we neither use it 
for trivial matters, nor take an oath which on the basis of the 
circumstances could be interpreted as approval of an authority unjustly 
requiring it. When an oath is required by illegitimate civil authorities, it 
may be refused. It must be refused when it is required for purposes 
contrary to the dignity of persons or to ecclesial communion.

III. The Christian Name 

2156 The sacrament of Baptism is conferred "in the name of the 
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."85 In Baptism, the 
Lord's name sanctifies man, and the Christian receives his name in the 
Church. This can be the name of a saint, that is, of a disciple who has 
lived a life of exemplary fidelity to the Lord. the patron saint provides a 
model of charity; we are assured of his intercession. the "baptismal 
name" can also express a Christian mystery or Christian virtue. 
"Parents, sponsors, and the pastor are to see that a name is not given 
which is foreign to Christian sentiment."86 

2157 The Christian begins his day, his prayers, and his activities with 
the Sign of the Cross: "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of 
the Holy Spirit. Amen." the baptized person dedicates the day to the 
glory of God and calls on the Savior's grace which lets him act in the 
Spirit as a child of the Father. the sign of the cross strengthens us in 
temptations and difficulties. 



2158 God calls each one by name.87 Everyone's name is sacred. the 
name is the icon of the person. It demands respect as a sign of the 
dignity of the one who bears it. 

2159 The name one receives is a name for eternity. In the kingdom, the 
mysterious and unique character of each person marked with God's 
name will shine forth in splendor. "To him who conquers . . . I will give 
a white stone, with a new name written on the stone which no one 
knows except him who receives it."88 "Then I looked, and Lo, on 
Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with him a hundred and forty-four 
thousand who had his name and his Father's name written on their 
foreheads."89

Article 2 THE SECOND COMMANDMENT 

 

 

IN BRIEF 



2160 "O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth" 
(Ps 8:1)! 

2161 The second commandment enjoins respect for the Lord's name. 
the name of the Lord is holy. 

2162 The second commandment forbids every improper use of God's 
name. Blasphemy is the use of the name of God, of Jesus Christ, of the 
Virgin Mary, and of the saints in an offensive way. 

2163 False oaths call on God to be witness to a lie. Perjury is a grave 
offence against the Lord who is always faithful to his promises. 

2164 "Do not swear whether by the Creator, or any creature, except 
truthfully, of necessity, and with reverence" (St. Ignatius of Loyola, 
Spiritual Exercises, 38). 

2165 In Baptism, the Christian receives his name in the Church. 
Parents, godparents, and the pastor are to see that he be given a 
Christian name. the patron saint provides a model of charity and the 
assurance of his prayer. 

2166 The Christian begins his prayers and activities with the Sign of 
the Cross: "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy 
Spirit. Amen." 

2167 God calls each one by name (cf Isa 43:1).

I. The Sabbath Day 

2168 The third commandment of the Decalogue recalls the holiness of 
the sabbath: "The seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the 
LORD."92 

2169 In speaking of the sabbath Scripture recalls creation: "For in six 
days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in 
them, and rested the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the 
sabbath day and hallowed it."93 

2170 Scripture also reveals in the Lord's day a memorial of Israel's 
liberation from bondage in Egypt: "You shall remember that you were a 
servant in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out 
thence with mighty hand and outstretched arm; therefore the LORD 
your God commanded you to keep the sabbath day."94 

2171 God entrusted the sabbath to Israel to keep as a sign of the 
irrevocable covenant.95 The sabbath is for the Lord, holy and set apart 
for the praise of God, his work of creation, and his saving actions on 
behalf of Israel. 

2172 God's action is the model for human action. If God "rested and 
was refreshed" on the seventh day, man too ought to "rest" and should 
let others, especially the poor, "be refreshed."96 The sabbath brings 
everyday work to a halt and provides a respite. It is a day of protest 
against the servitude of work and the worship of money.97 

2173 The Gospel reports many incidents when Jesus was accused of 
violating the sabbath law. But Jesus never fails to respect the holiness of 
this day.98 He gives this law its authentic and authoritative 
interpretation: "The sabbath was made for man, not man for the 
sabbath."99 With compassion, Christ declares the sabbath for doing 
good rather than harm, for saving life rather than killing.100 The 
sabbath is the day of the Lord of mercies and a day to honor God.101 
"The Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath."102

II. The Lord's Day 

This is the day which the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad 
in it.103  

 

The day of the Resurrection: the new creation 

2174 Jesus rose from the dead "on the first day of the week."104 
Because it is the "first day," the day of Christ's Resurrection recalls the 
first creation. Because it is the "eighth day" following the sabbath,105 
it symbolizes the new creation ushered in by Christ's Resurrection. For 
Christians it has become the first of all days, the first of all feasts, the 
Lord's Day (he kuriake hemera, dies dominica) Sunday: 

We all gather on the day of the sun, for it is the first day [after the 
Jewish sabbath, but also the first day] when God, separating matter 
from darkness, made the world; and on this same day Jesus Christ our 
Savior rose from the dead.106 

Sunday - fulfillment of the sabbath 

2175 Sunday is expressly distinguished from the sabbath which it 
follows chronologically every week; for Christians its ceremonial 
observance replaces that of the sabbath. In Christ's Passover, Sunday 
fulfills the spiritual truth of the Jewish sabbath and announces man's 
eternal rest in God. For worship under the Law prepared for the 
mystery of Christ, and what was done there prefigured some aspects of 
Christ:107 



Those who lived according to the old order of things have come to a 
new hope, no longer keeping the sabbath, but the Lord's Day, in which 
our life is blessed by him and by his death.108 

2176 The celebration of Sunday observes the moral commandment 
inscribed by nature in the human heart to render to God an outward, 
visible, public, and regular worship "as a sign of his universal 
beneficence to all."109 Sunday worship fulfills the moral command of 
the Old Covenant, taking up its rhythm and spirit in the weekly 
celebration of the Creator and Redeemer of his people. 

The Sunday Eucharist 

2177 The Sunday celebration of the Lord's Day and his Eucharist is at 
the heart of the Church's life.  

"Sunday is the day on which the paschal mystery is celebrated in light 
of the apostolic tradition and is to be observed as the foremost holy 
day of obligation in the universal Church."110 

"Also to be observed are the day of the Nativity of Our Lord Jesus 
Christ,  

the Epiphany,  

the Ascension of Christ,  

the feast of the Body and Blood of Christi,  

the feast of Mary the Mother of God,  

her Immaculate Conception,  

her Assumption,  

the feast of Saint Joseph,  

the feast of the Apostles Saints Peter and Paul, and the feast of All 
Saints."111 

2178 This practice of the Christian assembly dates from the beginnings 
of the apostolic age.112 The Letter to the Hebrews reminds the 
faithful "not to neglect to meet together, as is the habit of some, but to 
encourage one another."113 



Tradition preserves the memory of an ever-timely exhortation: Come 
to Church early, approach the Lord, and confess your sins, repent in 
prayer.... Be present at the sacred and divine liturgy, conclude its 
prayer and do not leave before the dismissal.... We have often said: 
"This day is given to you for prayer and rest. This is the day that the 
Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad in it."114 

2179 "A parish is a definite community of the Christian faithful 
established on a stable basis within a particular church; the pastoral 
care of the parish is entrusted to a pastor as its own shepherd under 
the authority of the diocesan bishop."115 It is the place where all the 
faithful can be gathered together for the Sunday celebration of the 
Eucharist. the parish initiates the Christian people into the ordinary 
expression of the liturgical life: it gathers them together in this 
celebration; it teaches Christ's saving doctrine; it practices the charity 
of the Lord in good works and brotherly love: 

You cannot pray at home as at church, where there is a great 
multitude, where exclamations are cried out to God as from one great 
heart, and where there is something more: the union of minds, the 
accord of souls, the bond of charity, the prayers of the priests.116 

The Sunday obligation 

2180 The precept of the Church specifies the law of the Lord more 
precisely: "On Sundays and other holy days of obligation the faithful 
are bound to participate in the Mass."117 "The precept of 
participating in the Mass is satisfied by assistance at a Mass which is 
celebrated anywhere in a Catholic rite either on the holy day or on the 
evening of the preceding day."118 

2181 The Sunday Eucharist is the foundation and confirmation of all 
Christian practice. For this reason the faithful are obliged to 
participate in the Eucharist on days of obligation, unless excused for a 
serious reason (for example, illness, the care of infants) or dispensed by 
their own pastor.119 Those who deliberately fail in this obligation 
commit a grave sin. 

2182 Participation in the communal celebration of the Sunday 
Eucharist is a testimony of belonging and of being faithful to Christ 
and to his Church. the faithful give witness by this to their communion 



in faith and charity. Together they testify to God's holiness and their 
hope of salvation. They strengthen one another under the guidance of 
the Holy Spirit. 

2183 "If because of lack of a sacred minister or for other grave cause 
participation in the celebration of the Eucharist is impossible, it is 
specially recommended that the faithful take part in the Liturgy of the 
Word if it is celebrated in the parish church or in another sacred place 
according to the prescriptions of the diocesan bishop, or engage in 
prayer for an appropriate amount of time personally or in a family or, 
as occasion offers, in groups of families."120 

A day of grace and rest from work 

2184 Just as God "rested on the seventh day from all his work which 
he had done,"121 human life has a rhythm of work and rest. the 
institution of the Lord's Day helps everyone enjoy adequate rest and 
leisure to cultivate their familial, cultural, social, and religious lives.122 

2185 On Sundays and other holy days of obligation, the faithful are to 
refrain from engaging in work or activities that hinder the worship 
owed to God, the joy proper to the Lord's Day, the performance of the 
works of mercy, and the appropriate relaxation of mind and body.123 
Family needs or important social service can legitimately excuse from 
the obligation of Sunday rest. the faithful should see to it that 
legitimate excuses do not lead to habits prejudicial to religion, family 
life, and health. 

The charity of truth seeks holy leisure - the necessity of charity accepts 
just work.124 

2186 Those Christians who have leisure should be mindful of their 
brethren who have the same needs and the same rights, yet cannot rest 
from work because of poverty and misery. Sunday is traditionally 
consecrated by Christian piety to good works and humble service of 
the sick, the infirm, and the elderly. Christians will also sanctify 
Sunday by devoting time and care to their families and relatives, often 
difficult to do on other days of the week. Sunday is a time for 
reflection, silence, cultivation of the mind, and meditation which 
furthers the growth of the Christian interior life. 



2187 Sanctifying Sundays and holy days requires a common effort. 
Every Christian should avoid making unnecessary demands on others 
that would hinder them from observing the Lord's Day. Traditional 
activities (sport, restaurants, etc.), and social necessities (public 
services, etc.), require some people to work on Sundays, but everyone 
should still take care to set aside sufficient time for leisure. With 
temperance and charity the faithful will see to it that they avoid the 
excesses and violence sometimes associated with popular leisure 
activities. In spite of economic constraints, public authorities should 
ensure citizens a time intended for rest and divine worship. Employers 
have a similar obligation toward their employees. 

2188 In respecting religious liberty and the common good of all, 
Christians should seek recognition of Sundays and the Church's holy 
days as legal holidays. They have to give everyone a public example of 
prayer, respect, and joy and defend their traditions as a precious 
contribution to the spiritual life of society. If a country's legislation or 
other reasons require work on Sunday, the day should nevertheless be 
lived as the day of our deliverance which lets us share in this "festal 
gathering," this "assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in 
heaven."125

IN BRIEF 

2189 "Observe the sabbath day, to keep it holy" (Deut 5:12). "The 
seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the Lord" (Ex 31:15). 

2190 The sabbath, which represented the completion of the first 
creation, has been replaced by Sunday which recalls the new creation 
inaugurated by the Resurrection of Christ. 

2191 The Church celebrates the day of Christ's Resurrection on the 
"eighth day," Sunday, which is rightly called the Lord's Day (cf SC 
106). 

2192 "Sunday . . . is to be observed as the foremost holy day of 
obligation in the universal Church" (CIC, can. 1246 # 1). "On 
Sundays and other holy days of obligation the faithful are bound to 
participate in the Mass" (CIC, can. 1247). 

2193 "On Sundays and other holy days of obligation the faithful are 
bound . . . to abstain from those labors and business concerns which 
impede the worship to be rendered to God, the joy which is proper to 
the Lord's Day, or the proper relaxation of mind and body" (CIC, can. 
1247). 

2194 The institution of Sunday helps all "to be allowed sufficient rest 
and leisure to cultivate their amilial, cultural, social, and religious lives" 
(GS 67 # 3). 



2195 Every Christian should avoid making unnecessary demands on 
others that would hinder them from observing the Lord's Day.

CHAPTER TWO YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS 
YOURSELF 

Jesus said to his disciples: "Love one another even as I have loved 
you."1 

2196 In response to the question about the first of the 
commandments, Jesus says: "The first is, 'Hear, O Israel: the Lord our 
God, the Lord is one; and you shall love the Lord your God with all 
your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all 



your strength.' the second is this, 'You shall love your neighbor as 
yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these."2  

The apostle St. Paul reminds us of this: "He who loves his neighbor has 
fulfilled the law. the commandments, 'You shall not commit adultery, 
You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,' and any other 
commandment, are summed up in this sentence, 'You shall love your 
neighbor as yourself.' Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love 
is the fulfilling of the law."3

ARTICLE 4 THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT 

Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the 
land which the Lord your God gives you.4 

He was obedient to them.5 

The Lord Jesus himself recalled the force of this "commandment of 
God."6 The Apostle teaches: "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, 
for this is right. 'Honor your father and mother,' (This is the first 
commandment with a promise.) 'that it may be well with you and that 
you may live long on the earth."'7 

2197 The fourth commandment opens the second table of the 
Decalogue. It shows us the order of charity. God has willed that, after 
him, we should honor our parents to whom we owe life and who have 
handed on to us the knowledge of God. We are obliged to honor and 
respect all those whom God, for our good, has vested with his 
authority. 

2198 This commandment is expressed in positive terms of duties to be 
fulfilled. It introduces the subsequent commandments which are 
concerned with particular respect for life, marriage, earthly goods, and 



speech. It constitutes one of the foundations of the social doctrine of 
the Church. 

2199 The fourth commandment is addressed expressly to children in 
their relationship to their father and mother, because this relationship 
is the most universal. It likewise concerns the ties of kinship between 
members of the extended family. It requires honor, affection, and 
gratitude toward elders and ancestors. Finally, it extends to the duties 
of pupils to teachers, employees to employers, subordinates to leaders, 
citizens to their country, and to those who administer or govern it. This 
commandment includes and presupposes the duties of parents, 
instructors, teachers, leaders, magistrates, those who govern, all who 
exercise authority over others or over a community of persons. 

2200 Observing the fourth commandment brings its reward: "Honor 
your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land 
which the LORD your God gives you."8 Respecting this 
commandment provides, along with spiritual fruits, temporal fruits of 
peace and prosperity. Conversely, failure to observe it brings great 
harm to communities and to individuals.

ARTICLE 4 THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT 

 

 

I. The Family in God's Plan 

The nature of the family 

2201 The conjugal community is established upon the consent of the 
spouses. Marriage and the family are ordered to the good of the 
spouses and to the procreation and education of children. the love of 
the spouses and the begetting of children create among members of 
the same family personal relationships and primordial responsibilities. 

2202 A man and a woman united in marriage, together with their 
children, form a family. This institution is prior to any recognition by 
public authority, which has an obligation to recognize it. It should be 
considered the normal reference point by which the different forms of 
family relationship are to be evaluated. 

2203 In creating man and woman, God instituted the human family 
and endowed it with its fundamental constitution. Its members are 
persons equal in dignity. For the common good of its members and of 
society, the family necessarily has manifold responsibilities, rights, and 
duties. 

The Christian family 

2204 "The Christian family constitutes a specific revelation and 
realization of ecclesial communion, and for this reason it can and 
should be called a domestic church."9 It is a community of faith, hope, 
and charity; it assumes singular importance in the Church, as is 
evident in the New Testament.10 

2205 The Christian family is a communion of persons, a sign and 
image of the communion of the Father and the Son in the Holy Spirit. 
In the procreation and education of children it reflects the Father's 
work of creation. It is called to partake of the prayer and sacrifice of 
Christ. Daily prayer and the reading of the Word of God strengthen it 
in charity. the Christian family has an evangelizing and missionary 
task. 



2206 The relationships within the family bring an affinity of feelings, 
affections and interests, arising above all from the members' respect for

II. The Family and Society 

2207 The family is the original cell of social life. It is the natural society 
in which husband and wife are called to give themselves in love and in 
the gift of life. Authority, stability, and a life of relationships within the 
family constitute the foundations for freedom, security, and fraternity 
within society. the family is the community in which, from childhood, 
one can learn moral values, begin to honor God, and make good use of 
freedom. Family life is an initiation into life in society. 

2208 The family should live in such a way that its members learn to 
care and take responsibility for the young, the old, the sick, the 
handicapped, and the poor. There are many families who are at times 
incapable of providing this help. It devolves then on other persons, 
other families, and, in a subsidiary way, society to provide for their 
needs: "Religion that is pure and undefiled before God and the Father 
is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction and to keep 
oneself unstained from the world."12 



2209 The family must be helped and defended by appropriate social 
measures. Where families cannot fulfill their responsibilities, other 
social bodies have the duty of helping them and of supporting the 
institution of the family. Following the principle of subsidiarity, larger 
communities should take care not to usurp the family's prerogatives or 
interfere in its life. 

2210 The importance of the family for the life and well-being of 
society13 entails a particular responsibility for society to support and 
strengthen marriage and the family. Civil authority should consider it a 
grave duty "to acknowledge the true nature of marriage and the family, 
to protect and foster them, to safeguard public morality, and promote 
domestic prosperity."14 

2211 The political community has a duty to honor the family, to assist 
it, and to ensure especially:  

- the freedom to establish a family, have children, and bring them up in 
keeping with the family's own moral and religious convictions;  

- the protection of the stability of the marriage bond and the institution 
of the family;  

- the freedom to profess one's faith, to hand it on, and raise one's 
children in it, with the necessary means and institutions;  

- the right to private property, to free enterprise, to obtain work and 
housing, and the right to emigrate;  

- in keeping with the country's institutions, the right to medical care, 
assistance for the aged, and family benefits;  

- the protection of security and health, especially with respect to 
dangers like drugs, pornography, alcoholism, etc.;  

- the freedom to form associations with other families and so to have 
representation before civil authority.15 

2212 The fourth commandment illuminates other relationships in 
society. In our brothers and sisters we see the children of our parents; 
in our cousins, the descendants of our ancestors; in our fellow citizens, 
the children of our country; in the baptized, the children of our mother 
the Church; in every human person, a son or daughter of the One who 



wants to be called "our Father." In this way our relationships with our 
neighbors are recognized as personal in character. the neighbor is not a 
"unit" in the human collective; he is "someone" who by his known 
origins deserves particular attention and respect. 

2213 Human communities are made up of persons. Governing them 
well is not limited to guaranteeing rights and fulfilling duties such as 
honoring contracts. Right relations between employers and employees, 
between those who govern and citizens, presuppose a natural good will 
in keeping with the dignity of human persons concerned for justice and 
fraternity.

III. The Duties of Family Members 

The duties of children 

2214 The divine fatherhood is the source of human fatherhood;16 this 
is the foundation of the honor owed to parents. the respect of children, 
whether minors or adults, for their father and mother17 is nourished 



by the natural affection born of the bond uniting them. It is required 
by God's commandment.18 

2215 Respect for parents (filial piety) derives from gratitude toward 
those who, by the gift of life, their love and their work, have brought 
their children into the world and enabled them to grow in stature, 
wisdom, and grace. "With all your heart honor your father, and do not 
forget the birth pangs of your mother. Remember that through your 
parents you were born; what can you give back to them that equals 
their gift to you?"19 

2216 Filial respect is shown by true docility and obedience. "My son, 
keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's 
teaching.... When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they 
will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you."20 
"A wise son hears his father's instruction, but a scoffer does not listen 
to rebuke."21 

2217 As long as a child lives at home with his parents, the child should 
obey his parents in all that they ask of him when it is for his good or 
that of the family. "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this 
pleases the Lord."22 Children should also obey the reasonable 
directions of their teachers and all to whom their parents have 
entrusted them. But if a child is convinced in conscience that it would 
be morally wrong to obey a particular order, he must not do so.  

As they grow up, children should continue to respect their parents. 
They should anticipate their wishes, willingly seek their advice, and 
accept their just admonitions. Obedience toward parents ceases with 
the emancipation of the children; not so respect, which is always owed 
to them. This respect has its roots in the fear of God, one of the gifts of 
the Holy Spirit. 

2218 The fourth commandment reminds grown children of their 
responsibilities toward their parents. As much as they can, they must 
give them material and moral support in old age and in times of illness, 
loneliness, or distress. Jesus recalls this duty of gratitude.23 

For the Lord honored the father above the children, and he confirmed 
the right of the mother over her sons. Whoever honors his father atones 
for sins, and whoever glorifies his mother is like one who lays up 



treasure. Whoever honors his father will be gladdened by his own 
children, and when he prays he will be heard. Whoever glorifies his 
father will have long life, and whoever obeys the Lord will refresh his 
mother.24  

O son, help your father in his old age, and do not grieve him as long as 
he lives; even if he is lacking in understanding, show forbearance; in all 
your strength do not despise him.... Whoever forsakes his father is like 
a blasphemer, and whoever angers his mother is cursed by the Lord.25 

2219 Filial respect promotes harmony in all of family life; it also 
concerns relationships between brothers and sisters. Respect toward 
parents fills the home with light and warmth. "Grandchildren are the 
crown of the aged."26 "With all humility and meekness, with patience, 
[support] one another in charity."27 

2220 For Christians a special gratitude is due to those from whom 
they have received the gift of faith, the grace of Baptism, and life in the 
Church. These may include parents, grandparents, other members of 
the family, pastors, catechists, and other teachers or friends. "I am 
reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your 
grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells 
in you."28 

The duties of parents 

2221 The fecundity of conjugal love cannot be reduced solely to the 
procreation of children, but must extend to their moral education and 
their spiritual formation. "The role of parents in education is of such 
importance that it is almost impossible to provide an adequate 
substitute."29 The right and the duty of parents to educate their 
children are primordial and inalienable.30 

2222 Parents must regard their children as children of God and 
respect them as human persons. Showing themselves obedient to the 
will of the Father in heaven, they educate their children to fulfill God's 
law. 

2223 Parents have the first responsibility for the education of their 
children. They bear witness to this responsibility first by creating a 
home where tenderness, forgiveness, respect, fidelity, and disinterested 



service are the rule. the home is well suited for education in the virtues. 
This requires an apprenticeship in self-denial, sound judgment, and 
self-mastery - the preconditions of all true freedom. Parents should 
teach their children to subordinate the "material and instinctual 
dimensions to interior and spiritual ones."31 Parents have a grave 
responsibility to give good example to their children. By knowing how 
to acknowledge their own failings to their children, parents will be 
better able to guide and correct them: 

He who loves his son will not spare the rod.... He who disciplines his 
son will profit by him.32  

Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in 
the discipline and instruction of the Lord.33 

2224 The home is the natural environment for initiating a human 
being into solidarity and communal responsibilities. Parents should 
teach children to avoid the compromising and degrading influences 
which threaten human societies. 

2225 Through the grace of the sacrament of marriage, parents receive 
the responsibility and privilege of evangelizing their children. Parents 
should initiate their children at an early age into the mysteries of the 
faith of which they are the "first heralds" for their children. They 
should associate them from their tenderest years with the life of the 
Church.34 A wholesome family life can foster interior dispositions that 
are a genuine preparation for a living faith and remain a support for it 
throughout one's life. 

2226 Education in the faith by the parents should begin in the child's 
earliest years. This already happens when family members help one 
another to grow in faith by the witness of a Christian life in keeping 
with the Gospel. Family catechesis precedes, accompanies, and 
enriches other forms of instruction in the faith. Parents have the 
mission of teaching their children to pray and to discover their vocation 
as children of God.35 The parish is the Eucharistic community and the 
heart of the liturgical life of Christian families; it is a privileged place 
for the catechesis of children and parents. 

2227 Children in turn contribute to the growth in holiness of their 
parents.36 Each and everyone should be generous and tireless in 



forgiving one another for offenses, quarrels, injustices, and neglect. 
Mutual affection suggests this. the charity of Christ demands it.37 

2228 Parents' respect and affection are expressed by the care and 
attention they devote to bringing up their young children and 
providing for their physical and spiritual needs. As the children grow 
up, the same respect and devotion lead parents to educate them in the 
right use of their reason and freedom. 

2229 As those first responsible for the education of their children, 
parents have the right to choose a school for them which corresponds 
to their own convictions. This right is fundamental. As far as possible 
parents have the duty of choosing schools that will best help them in 
their task as Christian educators.38 Public authorities have the duty of 
guaranteeing this parental right and of ensuring the concrete 
conditions for its exercise. 

2230 When they become adults, children have the right and duty to 
choose their profession and state of life. They should assume their new 
responsibilities within a trusting relationship with their parents, 
willingly asking and receiving their advice and counsel. Parents should 
be careful not to exert pressure on their children either in the choice of 
a profession or in that of a spouse. This necessary restraint does not 
prevent them - quite the contrary from giving their children judicious 
advice, particularly when they are planning to start a family. 

2231 Some forgo marriage in order to care for their parents or 
brothers and sisters, to give themselves more completely to a 
profession, or to serve other honorable ends. They can contribute 
greatly to the good of the human family.

IV. The Family and the Kingdom 

2232 Family ties are important but not absolute. Just as the child 
grows to maturity and human and spiritual autonomy, so his unique 
vocation which comes from God asserts itself more clearly and 
forcefully. Parents should respect this call and encourage their children 
to follow it. They must be convinced that the first vocation of the 
Christian is to follow Jesus: "He who loves father or mother more than 
me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than 
me is not worthy of me."39 

2233 Becoming a disciple of Jesus means accepting the invitation to 
belong to God's family, to live in conformity with His way of life: "For 
whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother, and sister, 
and mother."40  

Parents should welcome and respect with joy and thanksgiving the 
Lord's call to one of their children to follow him in virginity for the 
sake of the Kingdom in the consecrated life or in priestly ministry.

ARTICLE 4 THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT 

 

 

V. The Authorities In Civil Society 

2234 God's fourth commandment also enjoins us to honor all who for 
our good have received authority in society from God. It clarifies the 
duties of those who exercise authority as well as those who benefit 
from it. 

Duties of civil authorities 

2235 Those who exercise authority should do so as a service. "Whoever 
would be great among you must be your servant."41 The exercise of 
authority is measured morally in terms of its divine origin, its 
reasonable nature and its specific object. No one can command or 
establish what is contrary to the dignity of persons and the natural law. 

2236 The exercise of authority is meant to give outward expression to a 
just hierarchy of values in order to facilitate the exercise of freedom 
and responsibility by all. Those in authority should practice distributive 
justice wisely, taking account of the needs and contribution of each, 
with a view to harmony and peace. They should take care that the 
regulations and measures they adopt are not a source of temptation by 
setting personal interest against that of the community.42 

2237 Political authorities are obliged to respect the fundamental rights 
of the human person. They will dispense justice humanely by 
respecting the rights of everyone, especially of families and the 
disadvantaged.  

The political rights attached to citizenship can and should be granted 
according to the requirements of the common good. They cannot be 
suspended by public authorities without legitimate and proportionate 
reasons. Political rights are meant to be exercised for the common 
good of the nation and the human community. 

The duties of citizens 



2238 Those subject to authority should regard those in authority as 
representatives of God, who has made them stewards of his gifts:43 
"Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution.... Live as 
free men, yet without using your freedom as a pretext for evil; but live 
as servants of God."44 Their loyal collaboration includes the right, and 
at times the duty, to voice their just criticisms of that which seems 
harmful to the dignity of persons and to the good of the community. 

2239 It is the duty of citizens to contribute along with the civil 
authorities to the good of society in a spirit of truth, justice, solidarity, 
and freedom. the love and service of one's country follow from the 
duty of gratitude and belong to the order of charity. Submission to 
legitimate authorities and service of the common good require citizens 
to fulfill their roles in the life of the political community. 

2240 Submission to authority and co-responsibility for the common 
good make it morally obligatory to pay taxes, to exercise the right to 
vote, and to defend one's country: 

Pay to all of them their dues, taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to 
whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom 
honor is due.45 

  

[Christians] reside in their own nations, but as resident aliens. They 
participate in all things as citizens and endure all things as foreigners.... 
They obey the established laws and their way of life surpasses the 
laws.... So noble is the position to which God has assigned them that 
they are not allowed to desert it.46 

The Apostle exhorts us to offer prayers and thanksgiving for kings and 
all who exercise authority, "that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, 
godly and respectful in every way."47 

2241 The more prosperous nations are obliged, to the extent they are 
able, to welcome the foreigner in search of the security and the means 
of livelihood which he cannot find in his country of origin. Public 
authorities should see to it that the natural right is respected that 
places a guest under the protection of those who receive him. 



Political authorities, for the sake of the common good for which they 
are responsible, may make the exercise of the right to immigrate 
subject to various juridical conditions, especially with regard to the 
immigrants' duties toward their country of adoption. Immigrants are 
obliged to respect with gratitude the material and spiritual heritage of 
the country that receives them, to obey its laws and to assist in carrying 
civic burdens. 

2242 The citizen is obliged in conscience not to follow the directives of 
civil authorities when they are contrary to the demands of the moral 
order, to the fundamental rights of persons or the teachings of the 
Gospel. Refusing obedience to civil authorities, when their demands 
are contrary to those of an upright conscience, finds its justification in 
the distinction between serving God and serving the political 
community. "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, 
and to God the things that are God's."48 "We must obey God rather 
than men":49 

When citizens are under the oppression of a public authority which 
oversteps its competence, they should still not refuse to give or to do 
what is objectively demanded of them by the common good; but it is 
legitimate for them to defend their own rights and those of their fellow 
citizens against the abuse of this authority within the limits of the 
natural law and the Law of the Gospel.50 

2243 Armed resistance to oppression by political authority is not 
legitimate, unless all the following conditions are met: 1) there is 
certain, grave, and prolonged violation of fundamental rights; 2) all 
other means of redress have been exhausted; 3) such resistance will not 
provoke worse disorders; 4) there is well-founded hope of success; and 
5) it is impossible reasonably to foresee any better solution. 

The political community and the Church 

2244 Every institution is inspired, at least implicitly, by a vision of man 
and his destiny, from which it derives the point of reference for its 
judgment, its hierarchy of values, its line of conduct. Most societies 
have formed their institutions in the recognition of a certain 
preeminence of man over things. Only the divinely revealed religion 
has clearly recognized man's origin and destiny in God, the Creator 



and Redeemer. the Church invites political authorities to measure their 
judgments and decisions against this inspired truth about God and 
man: 

Societies not recognizing this vision or rejecting it in the name of their 
independence from God are brought to seek their criteria and goal in 
themselves or to borrow them from some ideology. Since they do not 
admit that one can defend an objective criterion of good and evil, they 
arrogate to themselves an explicit or implicit totalitarian power over 
man and his destiny, as history shows.51 

2245 The Church, because of her commission and competence, is not 
to be confused in any way with the political community. She is both 
the sign and the safeguard of the transcendent character of the human 
person. "The Church respects and encourages the political freedom 
and responsibility of the citizen."52 

2246 It is a part of the Church's mission "to pass moral judgments 
even in matters related to politics, whenever the fundamental rights of 
man or the salvation of souls requires it. the means, the only means, 
she may use are those which are in accord with the Gospel and the 
welfare of all men according to the diversity of times and 
circumstances."53

IN BRIEF 

2247 "Honor your father and your mother" (Deut 5:16; Mk 7:10). 

2248 According to the fourth commandment, God has willed that, 
after him, we should honor our parents and those whom he has vested 
with authority for our good. 

2249 The conjugal community is established upon the covenant and 
consent of the spouses. Marriage and family are ordered to the good of 
the spouses, to the procreation and the education of children. 

2250 "The well-being of the individual person and of both human and 
Christian society is closely bound up with the healthy state of conjugal 
and family life" (GS 47 # 1). 

2251 Children owe their parents respect, gratitude, just obedience, and 
assistance. Filial respect fosters harmony in all of family life. 

2252 Parents have the first responsibility for the education of their 
children in the faith, prayer, and all the virtues. They have the duty to 
provide as far as possible for the physical and spiritual needs of their 
children. 

2253 Parents should respect and encourage their children's vocations. 
They should remember and teach that the first calling of the Christian 
is to follow Jesus. 

2254 Public authority is obliged to respect the fundamental rights of 
the human person and the conditions for the exercise of his freedom. 

2255 It is the duty of citizens to work with civil authority for building 
up society in a spirit of truth, justice, solidarity, and freedom. 

2256 Citizens are obliged in conscience not to follow the directives of 
civil authorities when they are contrary to the demands of the moral 
order. "We must obey God rather than men" (Acts 5:29). 



2257 Every society's judgments and conduct reflect a vision of man 
and his destiny. Without the light the Gospel sheds on God and man, 
societies easily become totalitarian.

You shall not kill.54  



 

You have heard that it was said to the men of old, "You shall not kill: 
and whoever kills shall be liable to judgment." But I say to you that 
every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment.55 

2258 "Human life is sacred because from its beginning it involves the 
creative action of God and it remains for ever in a special relationship 
with the Creator, who is its sole end. God alone is the Lord of life from 
its beginning until its end: no one can under any circumstance claim

CHAPTER TWO YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS 
YOURSELF 

 

 

 

Article 5 THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT 

 

 

I. Respect for Human Life 

The witness of sacred history 

2259 In the account of Abel's murder by his brother Cain,57 Scripture 
reveals the presence of anger and envy in man, consequences of 
original sin, from the beginning of human history. Man has become 
the enemy of his fellow man. God declares the wickedness of this 
fratricide: "What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood is 
crying to me from the ground. and now you are cursed from the 
ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood 
from your hand."58 

2260 The covenant between God and mankind is interwoven with 
reminders of God's gift of human life and man's murderous violence: 



For your lifeblood I will surely require a reckoning.... Whoever sheds 
the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for God made man 
in his own image.59 

The Old Testament always considered blood a sacred sign of life.60 
This teaching remains necessary for all time. 

2261 Scripture specifies the prohibition contained in the fifth 
commandment: "Do not slay the innocent and the righteous."61 The 
deliberate murder of an innocent person is gravely contrary to the 
dignity of the human being, to the golden rule, and to the holiness of 
the Creator. the law forbidding it is universally valid: it obliges each 
and everyone, always and everywhere. 

2262 In the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord recalls the 
commandment, "You shall not kill,"62 and adds to it the proscription 
of anger, hatred, and vengeance. Going further, Christ asks his 
disciples to turn the other cheek, to love their enemies.63 He did not 
defend himself and told Peter to leave his sword in its sheath.64 

Legitimate defense 

2263 The legitimate defense of persons and societies is not an 
exception to the prohibition against the murder of the innocent that 
constitutes intentional killing. "The act of self-defense can have a 
double effect: the preservation of one's own life; and the killing of the 
aggressor.... the one is intended, the other is not."65 

2264 Love toward oneself remains a fundamental principle of morality. 
Therefore it is legitimate to insist on respect for one's own right to life. 
Someone who defends his life is not guilty of murder even if he is 
forced to deal his aggressor a lethal blow: 

If a man in self-defense uses more than necessary violence, it will be 
unlawful: whereas if he repels force with moderation, his defense will 
be lawful.... Nor is it necessary for salvation that a man omit the act of 
moderate self-defense to avoid killing the other man, since one is 
bound to take more care of one's own life than of another's. 

2265 Legitimate defense can be not only a right but a grave duty for 
one who is responsible for the lives of others life. The defense of the 
common good requires that an unjust aggressor be rendered unable to 



cause harm. For this reason , those who legitimately hold authority 
also have the right to use arms to repel aggressors against the civil 
community entrusted to their responsibility.66 

Capital Punishment 

2266 The efforts of the state to curb the spread of behavior harmful to 
people's rights and to the basic rules of civil society correspond to the 
requirement of safeguarding the common good. Legitimate public 
authority has the right and the duty to inflict punishment 
proportionate to the gravity of the offence. Punishment has the 
primary aim of redressing the disorder introduced by the offense. 
When it is willingly accepted by the guilty party, it assumes the value of 
expiation. Punishment then, in addition to defending public order and 
protecting people's safety, has a medicinal purpose: it must contribute 
to the correction of the guilty party.67 

2267 Assuming that the guilty party's identity and responsibility have 
been fully determined, the traditional teaching of the Church does nor 
exclude recourse to the death penalty, if this is the only possible way of 
effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor.   

If, however non-lethal means are sufficient to defend and protect 
people's safety from the aggressor, authority will limit itself to such 
means, as these are more in keeping with the concrete conditions of 
the common good and are more in conformity to the dignity of the 
human person.  

Today, in fact, as a consequence of the possibilities which the state has 
for effectively preventing crime, by rendering one who has committed 
an offence incapable of doing harm - without definitively taking away 
from him the possibility of redeeming himself - the cases in which the 
execution of the offender is an absolute necessity 'are very rare, if not 
practically non-existent.' party.67B 

Intentional homicide 

2268 The fifth commandment forbids direct and intentional killing as 
gravely sinful. the murderer and those who cooperate voluntarily in 
murder commit a sin that cries out to heaven for vengeance.68 



Infanticide,69 fratricide, parricide, and the murder of a spouse are 
especially grave crimes by reason of the natural bonds which they 
break. Concern for eugenics or public health cannot justify any 
murder, even if commanded by public authority. 

2269 The fifth commandment forbids doing anything with the 
intention of indirectly bringing about a person's death. the moral law 
prohibits exposing someone to mortal danger without grave reason, as 
well as refusing assistance to a person in danger. 

The acceptance by human society of murderous famines, without 
efforts to remedy them, is a scandalous injustice and a grave offense. 
Those whose usurious and avaricious dealings lead to the hunger and 
death of their brethren in the human family indirectly commit 
homicide, which is imputable to them.70 

Unintentional killing is not morally imputable. But one is not 
exonerated from grave offense if, without proportionate reasons, he has 
acted in a way that brings about someone's death, even without the 
intention to do so. 

Abortion 

2270 Human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the 
moment of conception. 

From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be 
recognized as having the rights of a person - among which is the 
inviolable right of every innocent being to life.71 

Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were 
born I consecrated you.72  

My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, 
intricately wrought in the depths of the earth.73 

2271 Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of 
every procured abortion.  

This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable.  

Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a 
means, is gravely contrary to the moral law: 



You shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the 
newborn to perish.74  

God, the Lord of life, has entrusted to men the noble mission of 
safeguarding life, and men must carry it out in a manner worthy of 
themselves.  

Life must be protected with the utmost care from the moment of 
conception: abortion and infanticide are abominable crimes.75 

2272 Formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense.  

The Church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this 
crime against human life.  

"A person who procures a completed abortion incurs 
excommunication latae sententiae,"76 "by the very commission of the 
offense,"77 and subject to the conditions provided by Canon Law.78  

The Church does not thereby intend to restrict the scope of mercy.  

Rather, she makes clear the gravity of the crime committed, the 
irreparable harm done to the innocent who is put to death, as well as 
to the parents and the whole of society. 

2273 The inalienable right to life of every innocent human individual is 
a constitutive element of a civil society and its legislation: 

"The inalienable rights of the person must be recognized and respected 
by civil society and the political authority.  

These human rights depend neither on single individuals nor on 
parents; nor do they represent a concession made by society and the 
state; they belong to human nature and are inherent in the person by 
virtue of the creative act from which the person took his origin.  

Among such fundamental rights one should mention in this regard 
every human being's right to life and physical integrity from the 
moment of conception until death."79 

  

"The moment a positive law deprives a category of human beings of 
the protection which civil legislation ought to accord them, the state is 
denying the equality of all before the law.  



When the state does not place its power at the service of the rights of 
each citizen, and in particular of the more vulnerable, the very 
foundations of a state based on law are undermined....  

As a consequence of the respect and protection which must be ensured 
for the unborn child from the moment of conception, the law must 
provide appropriate penal sanctions for every deliberate violation of the 
child's rights."80 

2274 Since it must be treated from conception as a person, the embryo 
must be defended in its integrity, cared for, and healed, as far as 
possible, like any other human being. 

Prenatal diagnosis is morally licit, "if it respects the life and integrity of 
the embryo and the human fetus and is directed toward its safe 
guarding or healing as an individual....  

It is gravely opposed to the moral law when this is done with the 
thought of possibly inducing an abortion, depending upon the results: 
a diagnosis must not be the equivalent of a death sentence."81 

2275 "One must hold as licit procedures carried out on the human 
embryo which respect the life and integrity of the embryo and do not 
involve disproportionate risks for it, but are directed toward its healing 
the improvement of its condition of health, or its individual 
survival."82  

"It is immoral to produce human embryos intended for exploitation as 
disposable biological material."83  

"Certain attempts to influence chromosomic or genetic inheritance are 
not therapeutic but are aimed at producing human beings selected 
according to sex or other predetermined qualities.  

Such manipulations are contrary to the personal dignity of the human 
being and his integrity and identity"84 which are unique and 
unrepeatable. 

Euthanasia 

2276 Those whose lives are diminished or weakened deserve special 
respect. Sick or handicapped persons should be helped to lead lives as 
normal as possible. 



2277 Whatever its motives and means, direct euthanasia consists in 
putting an end to the lives of handicapped, sick, or dying persons.  

It is morally unacceptable. 

Thus an act or omission which, of itself or by intention, causes death 
in order to eliminate suffering constitutes a murder gravely contrary to 
the dignity of the human person and to the respect due to the living 
God, his Creator.  

The error of judgment into which one can fall in good faith does not 
change the nature of this murderous act, which must always be 
forbidden and excluded. 

2278 Discontinuing medical procedures that are burdensome, 
dangerous, extraordinary, or disproportionate to the expected outcome 
can be legitimate; it is the refusal of "over-zealous" treatment.  

Here one does not will to cause death; one's inability to impede it is 
merely accepted. 

The decisions should be made by the patient if he is competent and 
able or, if not, by those legally entitled to act for the patient, whose 
reasonable will and legitimate interests must always be respected. 

2279 Even if death is thought imminent, the ordinary care owed to a 
sick person cannot be legitimately interrupted.  

The use of painkillers to alleviate the sufferings of the dying, even at 
the risk of shortening their days, can be morally in conformity with 
human dignity if death is not willed as either an end or a means, but 
only foreseen and tolerated as inevitable  

Palliative care is a special form of disinterested charity.  

As such it should be encouraged. 

Suicide 

2280 Everyone is responsible for his life before God who has given it to 
him.  

It is God who remains the sovereign Master of life.  



We are obliged to accept life gratefully and preserve it for his honor 
and the salvation of our souls.  

We are stewards, not owners, of the life God has entrusted to us.  

It is not ours to dispose of. 

2281 Suicide contradicts the natural inclination of the human being to 
preserve and perpetuate his life.  

It is gravely contrary to the just love of self.  

It likewise offends love of neighbor because it unjustly breaks the ties 
of solidarity with family, nation, and other human societies to which 
we continue to have obligations.  

Suicide is contrary to love for the living God. 

2282 If suicide is committed with the intention of setting an example, 
especially to the young, it also takes on the gravity of scandal. 

Voluntary co-operation in suicide is contrary to the moral law.  

Grave psychological disturbances, anguish, or grave fear of hardship, 
suffering, or torture can diminish the responsibility of the one 
committing suicide. 

2283 We should not despair of the eternal salvation of persons who 
have taken their own lives. By ways known to him alone, God can 
provide the opportunity for salutary repentance. the Church prays for 
persons who have taken their own lives.

CHAPTER TWO YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS 
YOURSELF 

 

 

 



Article 5 THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT 

 

 

II. Respect for the Dignity of Persons 

Respect for the souls of others: scandal 

2284 Scandal is an attitude or behavior which leads another to do evil. 
the person who gives scandal becomes his neighbor's tempter. He 
damages virtue and integrity; he may even draw his brother into 
spiritual death. Scandal is a grave offense if by deed or omission 
another is deliberately led into a grave offense. 

2285 Scandal takes on a particular gravity by reason of the authority of 
those who cause it or the weakness of those who are scandalized. It 
prompted our Lord to utter this curse: "Whoever causes one of these 
little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a 
great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the 
depth of the sea."85 Scandal is grave when given by those who by 
nature or office are obliged to teach and educate others. Jesus 
reproaches the scribes and Pharisees on this account: he likens them to 
wolves in sheep's clothing.86 

2286 Scandal can be provoked by laws or institutions, by fashion or 
opinion. 

  

Therefore, they are guilty of scandal who establish laws or social 
structures leading to the decline of morals and the corruption of 
religious practice, or to "social conditions that, intentionally or not, 
make Christian conduct and obedience to the Commandments 
difficult and practically impossible."87 This is also true of business 
leaders who make rules encouraging fraud, teachers who provoke their 
children to anger,88 or manipulators of public opinion who turn it 
away from moral values. 

2287 Anyone who uses the power at his disposal in such a way that it 
leads others to do wrong becomes guilty of scandal and responsible for 



the evil that he has directly or indirectly encouraged. "Temptations to 
sin are sure to come; but woe to him by whom they come!"89 

Respect for health 

2288 Life and physical health are precious gifts entrusted to us by 
God.  

We must take reasonable care of them, taking into account the needs of 
others and the common good.  

Concern for the health of its citizens requires that society help in the 
attainment of living-conditions that allow them to grow and reach 
maturity: food and clothing, housing, health care, basic education, 
employment, and social assistance. 

2289 If morality requires respect for the life of the body, it does not 
make it an absolute value.  

It rejects a neo-pagan notion that tends to promote the cult of the 
body, to sacrifice everything for it's sake, to idolize physical perfection 
and success at sports.  

By its selective preference of the strong over the weak, such a 
conception can lead to the perversion of human relationships. 

2290 The virtue of temperance disposes us to avoid every kind of 
excess: the abuse of food, alcohol, tobacco, or medicine. Those incur 
grave guilt who, by drunkenness or a love of speed, endanger their own 
and others' safety on the road, at sea, or in the air. 

2291 The use of drugs inflicts very grave damage on human health and 
life. Their use, except on strictly therapeutic grounds, is a grave 
offense. Clandestine production of and trafficking in drugs are 
scandalous practices. They constitute direct co-operation in evil, since 
they encourage people to practices gravely contrary to the moral law. 

Respect for the person and scientific research 

2292 Scientific, medical, or psychological experiments on human 
individuals or groups can contribute to healing the sick and the 
advancement of public health. 



2293 Basic cientific research, as well as applied research, is a 
significant expression of man's dominion over creation. Science and 
technology are precious resources when placed at the service of man 
and promote his integral development for the benefit of all. By 
themselves however they cannot disclose the meaning of existence and 
of human progress. Science and technology are ordered to man, from 
whom they take their origin and development; hence they find in the 
person and in his moral values both evidence of their purpose and 
awareness of their limits. 

2294 It is an illusion to claim moral neutrality in scientific research 
and its applications. On the other hand, guiding principles cannot be 
inferred from simple technical efficiency, or from the usefulness 
accruing to some at the expense of others or, even worse, from 
prevailing ideologies. Science and technology by their very nature 
require unconditional respect for fundamental moral criteria. They 
must be at the service of the human person, of his inalienable rights, of 
his true and integral good, in conformity with the plan and the will of 
God. 

2295 Research or experimentation on the human being cannot 
legitimate acts that are in themselves contrary to the dignity of persons 
and to the moral law. the subjects' potential consent does not justify 
such acts. Experimentation on human beings is not morally legitimate 
if it exposes the subject's life or physical and psychological integrity to 
disproportionate or avoidable risks. Experimentation on human beings 
does not conform to the dignity of the person if it takes place without 
the informed consent of the subject or those who legitimately speak for 
him. 

2296 Organ transplants are in conformity with the moral law if the 
physical and psychological dangers and risks to the donor are 
proportionate to the good sought for the recipient. Organs donation 
after death is a noble and meritorious act and is to be encouraged as an 
expression of generous solidarity. It is not morally acceptable if the 
donor or his proxy has have not given explicit consent. 

Moreover, it is not morally admissible directly to bring about the 
disabling mutilation or death of a human being, even in order to delay 
the death of other persons. 



Respect for bodily integrity 

2297 Kidnapping and hostage taking bring on a reign of terror; by 
means of threats they subject their victims to intolerable pressures. 
They are morally wrong. Terrorism threatens, wounds, and kills 
indiscriminately; it is gravely against justice and charity.  Torture which 
uses physical or moral violence to extract confessions, punish the 
guilty, frighten opponents, or satisfy hatred is contrary to respect for 
the person and for human dignity. Except when performed for strictly 
therapeutic medical reasons, directly intended amputations, 
mutilations, and sterilizations performed on innocent persons are 
against the moral law.90 

2298 In times past, cruel practices were commonly used by legitimate 
governments to maintain law and order, often without protest from the 
Pastors of the Church, who themselves adopted in their own tribunals 
the prescriptions of Roman law concerning torture. Regrettable as 
these facts are, the Church always taught the duty of clemency and 
mercy. She forbade clerics to shed blood. In recent times it has become 
evident that these cruel practices were neither necessary for public 
order, nor in conformity with the legitimate rights of the human 
person. On the contrary, these practices led to ones even more 
degrading. It is necessary to work for their abolition. We must pray for 
the victims and their tormentors. 

Respect for the dead 

2299 The dying should be given attention and care to help them live 
their last moments in dignity and peace. They will be helped by the 
prayer of their relatives, who must see to it that the sick receive at the 
proper time the sacraments that prepare them to meet the living God. 

2300 The bodies of the dead must be treated with respect and charity, 
in faith and hope of the Resurrection. the burial of the dead is a 
corporal work of mercy;91 it honors the children of God, who are 
temples of the Holy Spirit. 

2301 Autopsies can be morally permitted for legal inquests or scientific 
research. the free gift of organs after death is legitimate and can be 
meritorious.  



The Church permits cremation, provided that it does not demonstrate 
a denial of faith in the resurrection of the body.92

Article 5 THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT 

 



 

III. Safeguarding Peace 

Peace 

2302 By recalling the commandment, "You shall not kill,"93 our Lord 
asked for peace of heart and denounced murderous anger and hatred 
as immoral.  

Anger is a desire for revenge. "To desire vengeance in order to do evil 
to someone who should be punished is illicit," but it is praiseworthy to 
impose restitution "to correct vices and maintain justice."94 If anger 
reaches the point of a deliberate desire to kill or seriously wound a 
neighbor, it is gravely against charity; it is a mortal sin. the Lord says, 
"Everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to 
judgment."95 

2303 Deliberate hatred is contrary to charity. Hatred of the neighbor is 
a sin when one deliberately wishes him evil. Hatred of the neighbor is a 
grave sin when one deliberately desires him grave harm. "But I say to 
you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that 
you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven."96 

2304 Respect for and development of human life require peace. Peace 
is not merely the absence of war, and it is not limited to maintaining a 
balance of powers between adversaries. Peace cannot be attained on 
earth without safeguarding the goods of persons, free communication 
among men, respect for the dignity of persons and peoples, and the 
assiduous practice of fraternity. Peace is "the tranquillity of order."97 
Peace is the work of justice and the effect of charity.98 

2305 Earthly peace is the image and fruit of the peace of Christ, the 
messianic "Prince of Peace."99 By the blood of his Cross, "in his wn 
person he killed the hostility,"100 he reconciled men with God and 
made his Church the sacrament of the unity of the human race and of 
its union with God. "He is our peace."101 He has declared: "Blessed 
are the peacemakers."102 

2306 Those who renounce violence and bloodshed and, in order to 
safeguard human rights, make use of those means of defense available 
to the weakest, bear witness to evangelical charity, provided they do so 



without harming the rights and obligations of other men and societies. 
They bear legitimate witness to the gravity of the physical and moral 
risks of recourse to violence, with all its destruction and death.103 

Avoiding war 

2307 The fifth commandment forbids the intentional destruction of 
human life. Because of the evils and injustices that accompany all war, 
the Church insistently urges everyone to prayer and to action so that 
the divine Goodness may free us from the ancient bondage of war.104 

2308 All citizens and all governments are obliged to work for the 
avoidance of war.  

However, "as long as the danger of war persists and there is no 
international authority with the necessary competence and power, 
governments cannot be denied the right of lawful self-defense, once all 
peace efforts have failed."105 

2309 The strict conditions for legitimate defense by military force 
require rigorous consideration. the gravity of such a decision makes it 
subject to rigorous conditions of moral legitimacy. At one and the same 
time:  

- the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of 
nations must be lasting, grave, and certain;  

- all other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be 
impractical or ineffective;  

- there must be serious prospects of success;  

- the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the 
evil to be eliminated. the power of modem means of destruction weighs 
very heavily in evaluating this condition. 

These are the traditional elements enumerated in what is called the 
"just war" doctrine.  

The evaluation of these conditions for moral legitimacy belongs to the 
prudential judgment of those who have responsibility for the common 
good. 



2310 Public authorities, in this case, have the right and duty to impose 
on citizens the obligations necessary for national defense.  

Those who are sworn to serve their country in the armed forces are 
servants of the security and freedom of nations. If they carry out their 
duty honorably, they truly contribute to the common good of the 
nation and the maintenance of peace.106 

2311 Public authorities should make equitable provision for those who 
for reasons of conscience refuse to bear arms; these are nonetheless 
obliged to serve the human community in some other way.107 

2312 The Church and human reason both assert the permanent 
validity of the moral law during armed conflict. "The mere fact that 
war has regrettably broken out does not mean that everything becomes 
licit between the warring parties."108 

2313 Non-combatants, wounded soldiers, and prisoners must be 
respected and treated humanely.  

Actions deliberately contrary to the law of nations and to its universal 
principles are crimes, as are the orders that command such actions. 
Blind obedience does not suffice to excuse those who carry them out. 
Thus the extermination of a people, nation, or ethnic minority must be 
condemned as a mortal sin. One is morally bound to resist orders that 
command genocide. 

2314 "Every act of war directed to the indiscriminate destruction of 
whole cities or vast areas with their inhabitants is a crime against God 
and man, which merits firm and unequivocal condemnation."109 A 
danger of modern warfare is that it provides the opportunity to those 
who possess modern scientific weapons especially atomic, biological, or 
chemical weapons - to commit such crimes. 

2315 The accumulation of arms strikes many as a paradoxically 
suitable way of deterring potential adversaries from war. They see it as 
the most effective means of ensuring peace among nations. This 
method of deterrence gives rise to strong moral reservations. the arms 
race does not ensure peace. Far from eliminating the causes of war, it 
risks aggravating them. Spending enormous sums to produce ever new 
types of weapons impedes efforts to aid needy populations;110 it 



thwarts the development of peoples. Over-armament multiplies 
reasons for conflict and increases the danger of escalation. 

2316 The production and the sale of arms affect the common good of 
nations and of the international community. Hence public authorities 
have the right and duty to regulate them. the short-term pursuit of 
private or collective interests cannot legitimate undertakings that 
promote violence and conflict among nations and compromise the 
international juridical order. 

2317 Injustice, excessive economic or social inequalities, envy, distrust, 
and pride raging among men and nations constantly threaten peace 
and cause wars. Everything done to overcome these disorders 
contributes to building up peace and avoiding war: 

Insofar as men are sinners, the threat of war hangs over them and will 
so continue until Christ comes again; but insofar as they can vanquish 
sin by coming together in charity, violence itself will be vanquished and 
these words will be fulfilled: "they shall beat their swords into 
plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up 
sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more."111

IN BRIEF 

2318 "In [God's] hand is the life of every living thing and the breath of 
all mankind" (Job 12:10). 

2319 Every human life, from the moment of conception until death, is 
sacred because the human person has been willed for its own sake in 
the image and likeness of the living and holy God. 



2320 The murder of a human being is gravely contrary to the dignity 
of the person and the holiness of the Creator. 

2321 The prohibition of murder does not abrogate the right to render 
an unjust aggressor unable to inflict harm. Legitimate defense is a 
grave duty for whoever is responsible for the lives of others or the 
common good. 

2322 From its conception, the child has the right to life. Direct 
abortion, that is, abortion willed as an end or as a means, is a 
"criminal" practice (GS 27 # 3), gravely contrary to the moral law. the 
Church imposes the canonical penalty of excommunication for this 
crime against human life. 

2323 Because it should be treated as a person from conception, the 
embryo must be defended in its integrity, cared for, and healed like 
every other human being. 

2324 Intentional euthanasia, whatever its forms or motives, is murder. 
It is gravely contrary to the dignity of the human person and to the 
respect due to the living God, his Creator. 

2325 Suicide is seriously contrary to justice, hope, and charity. It is 
forbidden by the fifth commandment. 

2326 Scandal is a grave offense when by deed or omission it 
deliberately leads others to sin gravely. 

2327 Because of the evils and injustices that all war brings with it, we 
must do everything reasonably possible to avoid it. the Church prays: 
"From famine, pestilence, and war, O Lord, deliver us." 

2328 The Church and human reason assert the permanent validity of 
the moral law during armed conflicts. Practices deliberately contrary to 
the law of nations and to its universal principles are crimes. 

2329 "The arms race is one of the greatest curses on the human race 
and the harm it inflicts on the poor is more than can be endured" (GS 
81 # 3). 

2330 "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of 
God" (Mt 5:9).

I. "Male and Female He Created Them . . ." 

2331 "God is love and in himself he lives a mystery of personal loving 
communion. Creating the human race in his own image . . .. God 
inscribed in the humanity of man and woman the vocation, and thus 
the capacity and responsibility, of love and communion."114 

"God created man in his own image . . . male and female he created 
them";115 He blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and multiply";116 
"When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God. Male 
and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them 
Man when they were created."117 

2332 Sexuality affects all aspects of the human person in the unity of 
his body and soul. It especially concerns affectivity, the capacity to love 
and to procreate, and in a more general way the aptitude for forming 
bonds of communion with others. 

2333 Everyone, man and woman, should acknowledge and accept his 
sexual identity. Physical, moral, and spiritual difference and 
complementarity are oriented toward the goods of marriage and the 
flourishing of family life. the harmony of the couple and of society 
depends in part on the way in which the complementarity, needs, and 
mutual support between the sexes are lived out. 

2334 "In creating men 'male and female,' God gives man and woman 
an equal personal dignity."118 "Man is a person, man and woman 
equally so, since both were created in the image and likeness of the 
personal God."119 



2335 Each of the two sexes is an image of the power and tenderness of 
God, with equal dignity though in a different way. the union of man 
and woman in marriage is a way of imitating in the flesh the Creator's 
generosity and fecundity: "Therefore a man leaves his father and his 
mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one flesh."120 All 
human generations proceed from this union.121 

2336 Jesus came to restore creation to the purity of its origins. In the 
Sermon on the Mount, he interprets God's plan strictly: "You have 
heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I say to you 
that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed 
adultery with her in his heart."122 What God has joined together, let 
not man put asunder.123  

The tradition of the Church has understood the sixth commandment 
as encompassing the whole of human sexuality.

II. The Vocation to Chastity 

2337 Chastity means the successful integration of sexuality within the 
person and thus the inner unity of man in his bodily and spiritual 
being. Sexuality, in which man's belonging to the bodily and biological 
world is expressed, becomes personal and truly human when it is 
integrated into the relationship of one person to another, in the 
complete and lifelong mutual gift of a man and a woman.  

The virtue of chastity therefore involves the integrity of the person and 
the integrality of the gift. 

The integrity of the person 

2338 The chaste person maintains the integrity of the powers of life 
and love placed in him. This integrity ensures the unity of the person; 
it is opposed to any behavior that would impair it. It tolerates neither a 



double life nor duplicity in speech.124 
 

2339 Chastity includes an apprenticeship in self-mastery which is a 
training in human freedom. the alternative is clear: either man governs 
his passions and finds peace, or he lets himself be dominated by them 
and becomes unhappy.125 "Man's dignity therefore requires him to act 
out of conscious and free choice, as moved and drawn in a personal 
way from within, and not by blind impulses in himself or by mere 
external constraint. Man gains such dignity when, ridding himself of all 
slavery to the passions, he presses forward to his goal by freely 
choosing what is good and, by his diligence and skill, effectively secures 
for himself the means suited to this end."126 

2340 Whoever wants to remain faithful to his baptismal promises and 
resist temptations will want to adopt the means for doing so: self-
knowledge, practice of an ascesis adapted to the situations that 
confront him, obedience to God's commandments, exercise of the 
moral virtues, and fidelity to prayer. "Indeed it is through chastity that 
we are gathered together and led back to the unity from which we were 
fragmented into multiplicity."127 

2341 The virtue of chastity comes under the cardinal virtue of 
temperance, which seeks to permeate the passions and appetites of the 
senses with reason. 

2342 Self-mastery is a long and exacting work. One can never consider 
it acquired once and for all. It presupposes renewed effort at all stages 
of life.128 The effort required can be more intense in certain periods, 
such as when the personality is being formed during childhood and 
adolescence. 

2343 Chastity has laws of growth which progress through stages 
marked by imperfection and too often by sin. "Man . . . day by day 
builds himself up through his many free decisions; and so he knows, 
loves, and accomplishes moral good by stages of growth."129 

2344 Chastity represents an eminently personal task; it also involves a 
cultural effort, for there is "an interdependence between personal 
betterment and the improvement of society."130 Chastity presupposes 
respect for the rights of the person, in particular the right to receive 



information and an education that respect the moral and spiritual 
dimensions of human life. 

2345 Chastity is a moral virtue. It is also a gift from God, a grace, a 
fruit of spiritual effort.131 The Holy Spirit enables one whom the 
water of Baptism has regenerated to imitate the purity of Christ.132 

The integrality of the gift of self 

2346 Charity is the form of all the virtues. Under its influence, chastity 
appears as a school of the gift of the person. Self-mastery is ordered to 
the gift of self. Chastity leads him who practices it to become a witness 
to his neighbor of God's fidelity and loving kindness. 

2347 The virtue of chastity blossoms in friendship. It shows the 
disciple how to follow and imitate him who has chosen us as his 
friends,133 who has given himself totally to us and allows us to 
participate in his divine estate. Chastity is a promise of immortality.  

Chastity is expressed notably in friendship with one's neighbor. 
Whether it develops between persons of the same or opposite sex, 
friendship represents a great good for all. It leads to spiritual 
communion. 

The various forms of chastity 

2348 All the baptized are called to chastity. the Christian has "put on 
Christ,"134 The model for all chastity. All Christ's faithful are called to 
lead a chaste life in keeping with their particular states of life. At the 
moment of his Baptism, the Christian is pledged to lead his affective 
life in chastity. 

2349 "People should cultivate [chastity] in the way that is suited to 
their state of life. Some profess virginity or consecrated celibacy which 
enables them to give themselves to God alone with an undivided heart 
in a remarkable manner. Others live in the way prescribed for all by the 
moral law, whether they are married or single."135 Married people are 
called to live conjugal chastity; others practice chastity in continence: 

There are three forms of the virtue of chastity: the first is that of 
spouses, the second that of widows, and the third that of virgins. We do 



not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others.... This is 
what makes for the richness of the discipline of the Church.136 

2350 Those who are engaged to marry are called to live chastity in 
continence. They should see in this time of testing a discovery of 
mutual respect, an apprenticeship in fidelity, and the hope of receiving 
one another from God. They should reserve for marriage the 
expressions of affection that belong to married love. They will help 
each other grow in chastity. 

Offenses against chastity 

2351 Lust is disordered desire for or inordinate enjoyment of sexual 
pleasure. Sexual pleasure is morally disordered when sought for itself, 
isolated from its procreative and unitive purposes. 

2352 By masturbation is to be understood the deliberate stimulation of 
the genital organs in order to derive sexual pleasure. "Both the 
Magisterium of the Church, in the course of a constant tradition, and 
the moral sense of the faithful have been in no doubt and have firmly 
maintained that masturbation is an intrinsically and gravely disordered 
action."137 "The deliberate use of the sexual faculty, for whatever 
reason, outside of marriage is essentially contrary to its purpose." For 
here sexual pleasure is sought outside of "the sexual relationship which 
is demanded by the moral order and in which the total meaning of 
mutual self-giving and human procreation in the context of true love is 
achieved."138  

To form an equitable judgment about the subjects' moral responsibility 
and to guide pastoral action, one must take into account the affective 
immaturity, force of acquired habit, conditions of anxiety, or other 
psychological or social factors that lessen if not even reduce to a 
minimum, moral culpability. 

2353 Fornication is carnal union between an unmarried man and an 
unmarried woman. It is gravely contrary to the dignity of persons and 
of human sexuality which is naturally ordered to the good of spouses 
and the generation and education of children. Moreover, it is a grave 
scandal when there is corruption of the young. 



2354 Pornography consists in removing real or simulated sexual acts 
from the intimacy of the partners, in order to display them deliberately 
to third parties. It offends against chastity because it perverts the 
conjugal act, the intimate giving of spouses to each other. It does grave 
injury to the dignity of its participants (actors, vendors, the public), 
since each one becomes an object of base pleasure and illicit profit for 
others. It immerses all who are involved in the illusion of a fantasy 
world. It is a grave offense. Civil authorities should prevent the 
production and distribution of pornographic materials. 

2355 Prostitution does injury to the dignity of the person who engages 
in it, reducing the person to an instrument of sexual pleasure. the one 
who pays sins gravely against himself: he violates the chastity to which 
his Baptism pledged him and defiles his body, the temple of the Holy 
Spirit.139 Prostitution is a social scourge. It usually involves women, 
but also men, children, and adolescents (The latter two cases involve 
the added sin of scandal.). While it is always gravely sinful to engage in 
prostitution, the imputability of the offense can be attenuated by 
destitution, blackmail, or social pressure. 

2356 Rape is the forcible violation of the sexual intimacy of another 
person. It does injury to justice and charity. Rape deeply wounds the 
respect, freedom, and physical and moral integrity to which every 
person has a right. It causes grave damage that can mark the victim for 
life. It is always an intrinsically evil act. Graver still is the rape of 
children committed by parents (incest) or those responsible for the 
education of the children entrusted to them. 

Chastity and homosexuality 

2357 Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between 
women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction 
toward persons of the same sex. It has taken a great variety of forms 
through the centuries and in different cultures. Its psychological 
genesis remains largely unexplained. Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, 
which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity,140 tradition 
has always declared that "homosexual acts are intrinsically 
disordered."141 They are contrary to the natural law. They close the 
sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine 



affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can 
they be approved. 

2358 The number of men and women who have deep-seated 
homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is 
objectively disordered, constitutes for must of them a trial. They must 
be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of 
unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons 
are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to 
unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may 
encounter from their condition. 

2359 Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of self-
mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of 
disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and 
should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.

III. The Love of Husband and Wife 

2360 Sexuality is ordered to the conjugal love of man and woman. In 
marriage the physical intimacy of the spouses becomes a sign and 
pledge of spiritual communion. Marriage bonds between baptized 
persons are sanctified by the sacrament. 

2361 "Sexuality, by means of which man and woman give themselves 
to one another through the acts which are proper and exclusive to 
spouses, is not something simply biological, but concerns the 
innermost being of the human person as such. It is realized in a truly 
human way only if it is an integral part of the love by which a man and 
woman commit themselves totally to one another until death."142 

Tobias got out of bed and said to Sarah, "Sister, get up, and let us pray 
and implore our Lord that he grant us mercy and safety." So she got 
up, and they began to pray and implore that they might be kept safe. 
Tobias began by saying, "Blessed are you, O God of our fathers.... You 
made Adam, and for him you made his wife Eve as a helper and 
support. From the two of them the race of mankind has sprung. You 
said, 'It is not good that the man should be alone; let us make a helper 
for him like himself.' I now am taking this kinswoman of mine, not 



because of lust, but with sincerity. Grant that she and I may find mercy 
and that we may grow old together." and they both said, "Amen, 
Amen." Then they went to sleep for the night.143 

2362 "The acts in marriage by which the intimate and chaste union of 
the spouses takes place are noble and honorable; the truly human 
performance of these acts fosters the self-giving they signify and 
enriches the spouses in joy and gratitude."144 Sexuality is a source of 
joy and pleasure: 

The Creator himself . . . established that in the [generative] function, 
spouses should experience pleasure and enjoyment of body and spirit. 
Therefore, the spouses do nothing evil in seeking this pleasure and 
enjoyment. They accept what the Creator has intended for them. At 
the same time, spouses should know how to keep themselves within the 
limits of just moderation.145 

2363 The spouses' union achieves the twofold end of marriage: the 
good of the spouses themselves and the transmission of life. These two 
meanings or values of marriage cannot be separated without altering 
the couple's spiritual life and compromising the goods of marriage and 
the future of the family.  

The conjugal love of man and woman thus stands under the twofold 
obligation of fidelity and fecundity. 

Conjugal fidelity 

2364 The married couple forms "the intimate partnership of life and 
love established by the Creator and governed by his laws; it is rooted in 
the conjugal covenant, that is, in their irrevocable personal 
consent."146 Both give themselves definitively and totally to one 
another. They are no longer two; from now on they form one flesh. the 
covenant they freely contracted imposes on the spouses the obligation 
to preserve it as unique and indissoluble.147 "What therefore God has 
joined together, let not man put asunder."148 

2365 Fidelity expresses constancy in keeping one's given word. God is 
faithful. the Sacrament of Matrimony enables man and woman to 
enter into Christ's fidelity for his Church. Through conjugal chastity, 



they bear witness to this mystery before the world. 
 

St. John Chrysostom suggests that young husbands should say to their 
wives: I have taken you in my arms, and I love you, and I prefer you to 
my life itself. For the present life is nothing, and my most ardent 
dream is to spend it with you in such a way that we may be assured of 
not being separated in the life reserved for us.... I place your love above 
all things, and nothing would be more bitter or painful to me than to 
be of a different mind than you.149 

The fecundity of marriage 

2366 Fecundity is a gift, an end of marriage, for conjugal love naturally 
tends to be fruitful. A child does not come from outside as something 
added on to the mutual love of the spouses, but springs from the very 
heart of that mutual giving, as its fruit and fulfillment. So the Church, 
which "is on the side of life"150 teaches that "it is necessary that each 
and every marriage act must remain open 'per se' to the procreation of 
human life."151 "This particular doctrine, expounded on numerous 
occasions by the Magisterium, is based on the inseparable connection, 
established by God, which man on his own initiative may not break, 
between the unitive significance and the procreative significance which 
are both inherent to the marriage act."152 

2367 Called to give life, spouses share in the creative power and 
fatherhood of God.153 "Married couples should regard it as their 
proper mission to transmit human life and to educate their children; 
they should realize that they are thereby cooperating with the love of 
God the Creator and are, in a certain sense, its interpreters. They will 
fulfill this duty with a sense of human and Christian responsibility."154 

2368 A particular aspect of this responsibility concerns the regulation 
of procreation. For just reasons, spouses may wish to space the births 
of their children. It is their duty to make certain that their desire is not 
motivated by selfishness but is in conformity with the generosity 
appropriate to responsible parenthood. Moreover, they should conform 
their behavior to the objective criteria of morality: 

When it is a question of harmonizing married love with the responsible 
transmission of life, the morality of the behavior does not depend on 



sincere intention and evaluation of motives alone; but it must be 
determined by objective criteria, criteria drawn from the nature of the 
person and his acts, criteria that respect the total meaning of mutual 
self-giving and human procreation in the context of true love; this is 
possible only if the virtue of married chastity is practiced with sincerity 
of heart.155 

2369 "By safeguarding both these essential aspects, the unitive and the 
procreative, the conjugal act preserves in its fullness the sense of true 
mutual love and its orientation toward man's exalted vocation to 
parenthood."156 

2370 Periodic continence, that is, the methods of birth regulation 
based on self-observation and the use of infertile periods, is in 
conformity with the objective criteria of morality.157 These methods 
respect the bodies of the spouses, encourage tenderness between them, 
and favor the education of an authentic freedom. In contrast, "every 
action which, whether in anticipation of the conjugal act, or in its 
accomplishment, or in the development of its natural consequences, 
proposes, whether as an end or as a means, to render procreation 
impossible" is intrinsically evil:158 

Thus the innate language that expresses the total reciprocal self-giving 
of husband and wife is overlaid, through contraception, by an 
objectively contradictory language, namely, that of not giving oneself 
totally to the other. This leads not only to a positive refusal to be open 
to life but also to a falsification of the inner truth of conjugal love, 
which is called upon to give itself in personal totality.... the difference, 
both anthropological and moral, between contraception and recourse 
to the rhythm of the cycle . . . involves in the final analysis two 
irreconcilable concepts of the human person and of human 
sexuality.159 

2371 "Let all be convinced that human life and the duty of 
transmitting it are not limited by the horizons of this life only: their 
true evaluation and full significance can be understood only in 
reference to man's eternal destiny."160 

2372 The state has a responsibility for its citizens' well-being. In this 
capacity it is legitimate for it to intervene to orient the demography of 



the population. This can be done by means of objective and respectful 
information, but certainly not by authoritarian, coercive measures. The 
state may not legitimately usurp the initiative of spouses, who have the 
primary responsibility for the procreation and education of their 
children.161 In this area, it is not authorized to employ means 
contrary to the moral law. 

The gift of a child 

2373 acred Scripture and the Church's traditional practice see in large 
families a sign of God's blessing and the parents' generosity.162 

2374 Couples who discover that they are sterile suffer greatly. "What 
will you give me," asks Abraham of God, "for I continue childless?"163 
and Rachel cries to her husband Jacob, "Give me children, or I shall 
die!"164 

2375 Research aimed at reducing human sterility is to be encouraged, 
on condition that it is placed "at the service of the human person, of 
his inalienable rights, and his true and integral good according to the 
design and will of God."165 

2376 Techniques that entail the dissociation of husband and wife, by 
the intrusion of a person other than the couple (donation of sperm or 
ovum, surrogate uterus), are gravely immoral. These techniques 
(heterologous artificial insemination and fertilization) infringe the 
child's right to be born of a father and mother known to him and 
bound to each other by marriage. They betray the spouses' "right to 
become a father and a mother only through each other."166 

2377 Techniques involving only the married couple (homologous 
artificial insemination and fertilization) are perhaps less reprehensible, 
yet remain morally unacceptable. They dissociate the sexual act from 
the procreative act. the act which brings the child into existence is no 
longer an act by which two persons give themselves to one another, but 
one that "entrusts the life and identity of the embryo into the power of 
doctors and biologists and establishes the domination of technology 
over the origin and destiny of the human person. Such a relationship of 
domination is in itself contrary to the dignity and equality that must be 
common to parents and children."167 "Under the moral aspect 
procreation is deprived of its proper perfection when it is not willed as 



the fruit of the conjugal act, that is to say, of the specific act of the 
spouses' union .... Only respect for the link between the meanings of 
the conjugal act and respect for the unity of the human being make 
possible procreation in conformity with the dignity of the person."168 

2378 A child is not something owed to one, but is a gift. the "supreme 
gift of marriage" is a human person. A child may not be considered a 
piece of property, an idea to which an alleged "right to a child" would 
lead. In this area, only the child possesses genuine rights: the right "to 
be the fruit of the specific act of the conjugal love of his parents," and 
"the right to be respected as a person from the moment of his 
conception."169 

2379 The Gospel shows that physical sterility is not an absolute evil. 
Spouses who still suffer from infertility after exhausting legitimate 
medical procedures should unite themselves with the Lord's Cross, the 
source of all spiritual fecundity. They can give expression to their 
generosity by adopting abandoned children or performing demanding 
services for others.

IV. Offenses Against the Dignity of Marriage 

Adultery 

2380 Adultery refers to marital infidelity. When two partners, of whom 
at least one is married to another party, have sexual relations - even 
transient ones - they commit adultery. Christ condemns even adultery 
of mere desire.170 The sixth commandment and the New Testament 
forbid adultery absolutely.171 The prophets denounce the gravity of 
adultery; they see it as an image of the sin of idolatry.172 

2381 Adultery is an injustice. He who commits adultery fails in his 
commitment. He does injury to the sign of the covenant which the 



marriage bond is, transgresses the rights of the other spouse, and 
undermines the institution of marriage by breaking the contract on 
which it is based. He compromises the good of human generation and 
the welfare of children who need their parents' stable union. 

Divorce 

2382 The Lord Jesus insisted on the original intention of the Creator 
who willed that marriage be indissoluble.173 He abrogates the 
accommodations that had slipped into the old Law.174  

Between the baptized, "a ratified and consummated marriage cannot 
be dissolved by any human power or for any reason other than 
death."175 

2383 The separation of spouses while maintaining the marriage bond 
can be legitimate in certain cases provided for by canon law.176  

If civil divorce remains the only possible way of ensuring certain legal 
rights, the care of the children, or the protection of inheritance, it can 
be tolerated and does not constitute a moral offense. 

2384 Divorce is a grave offense against the natural law. It claims to 
break the contract, to which the spouses freely consented, to live with 
each other till death. Divorce does injury to the covenant of salvation, 
of which sacramental marriage is the sign. Contracting a new union, 
even if it is recognized by civil law, adds to the gravity of the rupture: 
the remarried spouse is then in a situation of public and permanent 
adultery: 

If a husband, separated from his wife, approaches another woman, he 
is an adulterer because he makes that woman commit adultery, and the 
woman who lives with him is an adulteress, because she has drawn 
another's husband to herself.177 

2385 Divorce is immoral also because it introduces disorder into the 
family and into society. This disorder brings grave harm to the deserted 
spouse, to children traumatized by the separation of their parents and 
often torn between them, and because of its contagious effect which 
makes it truly a plague on society. 



2386 It can happen that one of the spouses is the innocent victim of a 
divorce decreed by civil law; this spouse therefore has not contravened 
the moral law. There is a considerable difference between a spouse who 
has sincerely tried to be faithful to the sacrament of marriage and is 
unjustly abandoned, and one who through his own grave fault destroys 
a canonically valid marriage.178 

Other offenses against the dignity of marriage 

2387 The predicament of a man who, desiring to convert to the 
Gospel, is obliged to repudiate one or more wives with whom he has 
shared years of conjugal life, is understandable. However polygamy is 
not in accord with the moral law." [Conjugal] communion is radically 
contradicted by polygamy; this, in fact, directly negates the plan of 
God which was revealed from the beginning, because it is contrary to 
the equal personal dignity of men and women who in matrimony give 
themselves with a love that is total and therefore unique and 
exclusive."179 The Christian who has previously lived in polygamy has 
a grave duty in justice to honor the obligations contracted in regard to 
his former wives and his children. 

2388 Incest designates intimate relations between relatives or in-laws 
within a degree that prohibits marriage between them.180 St. Paul 
stigmatizes this especially grave offense: "It is actually reported that 
there is immorality among you . . . for a man is living with his father's 
wife.... In the name of the Lord Jesus ... you are to deliver this man to 
Satan for the destruction of the flesh...."181 Incest corrupts family 
relationships and marks a regression toward animality. 

2389 Connected to incest is any sexual abuse perpetrated by adults on 
children or adolescents entrusted to their care. the offense is 
compounded by the scandalous harm done to the physical and moral 
integrity of the young, who will remain scarred by it all their lives; and 
the violation of responsibility for their upbringing. 

2390 In a so-called free union, a man and a woman refuse to give 
juridical and public form to a liaison involving sexual intimacy. 

The expression "free union" is fallacious: what can "union" mean when 
the partners make no commitment to one another, each exhibiting a 
lack of trust in the other, in himself, or in the future? 



The expression covers a number of different situations: concubinage, 
rejection of marriage as such, or inability to make long-term 
commitments.182 All these situations offend against the dignity of 
marriage; they destroy the very idea of the family; they weaken the 
sense of fidelity. They are contrary to the moral law. the sexual act 
must take place exclusively within marriage. Outside of marriage it 
always constitutes a grave sin and excludes one from sacramental 
communion. 

2391 Some today claim a "right to a trial marriage" where there is an 
intention of getting married later. However firm the purpose of those 
who engage in premature sexual relations may be, "the fact is that such 
liaisons can scarcely ensure mutual sincerity and fidelity in a 
relationship between a man and a woman, nor, especially, can they 
protect it from inconstancy of desires or whim."183 Carnal union is 
morally legitimate only when a definitive community of life between a 
man and woman has been established. Human love does not tolerate 
"trial marriages." It demands a total and definitive gift of persons to 
one another.184

Article 6 THE SIXTH COMMANDMENT 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

2392 "Love is the fundamental and innate vocation of every human 
being" (FC 11). 

2393 By creating the human being man and woman, God gives 
personal dignity equally to the one and the other. Each of them, man 
and woman, should acknowledge and accept his sexual identity. 

2394 Christ is the model of chastity. Every baptized person is called to 
lead a chaste life, each according to his particular state of life. 

2395 Chastity means the integration of sexuality within the person. It 
includes an apprenticeship in self-mastery. 

2396 Among the sins gravely contrary to chastity are masturbation, 
fornication, pornography, and homosexual practices. 

2397 The covenant which spouses have freely entered into entails 
faithful love. It imposes on them the obligation to keep their marriage 
indissoluble. 

2398 Fecundity is a good, a gift and an end of marriage. By giving life, 
spouses participate in God's fatherhood. 

2399 The regulation of births represents one of the aspects of 
responsible fatherhood and motherhood. Legitimate intentions on the 
part of the spouses do not justify recourse to morally unacceptable 
means (for example, direct sterilization or contraception). 



2400 Adultery, divorce, polygamy, and free union are grave offenses 
against the dignity of marriage.

You shall not steal.185 

2401 The seventh commandment forbids unjustly taking or keeping 
the goods of one's neighbor and wronging him in any way with respect 
to his goods. It commands justice and charity in the care of earthly 
goods and the fruits of men's labor. For the sake of the common good, 
it requires respect for the universal destination of goods and respect for 
the right to private property. Christian life strives to order this world's 
goods to God and to fraternal charity.

I. The Universal Destination and the Private Ownership of Goods 

2402 In the beginning God entrusted the earth and its resources to the 
common stewardship of mankind to take care of them, master them by 
labor, and enjoy their fruits.186 The goods of creation are destined for 
the whole human race. However, the earth is divided up among men to 
assure the security of their lives, endangered by poverty and threatened 
by violence. the appropriation of property is legitimate for 
guaranteeing the freedom and dignity of persons and for helping each 
of them to meet his basic needs and the needs of those in his charge. It 
should allow for a natural solidarity to develop between men. 

2403 The right to private property, acquired or received in a just way, 
does not do away with the original gift of the earth to the whole of 
mankind. The universal destination of goods remains primordial, even 
if the promotion of the common good requires respect for the right to 
private property and its exercise. 

2404 "In his use of things man should regard the external goods he 
legitimately owns not merely as exclusive to himself but common to 
others also, in the sense that they can benefit others as well as 
himself."187 The ownership of any property makes its holder a steward 
of Providence, with the task of making it fruitful and communicating 
its benefits to others, first of all his family. 



2405 Goods of production - material or immaterial - such as land, 
factories, practical or artistic skills, oblige their possessors to employ 
them in ways that will benefit the greatest number. Those who hold 
goods for use and consumption should use them with moderation, 
reserving the better part for guests, for the sick and the poor. 

2406 Political authority has the right and duty to regulate the 
legitimate exercise of the right to ownership for the sake of the 
common good.188

Article 7 THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT 

 

 

II. Respect for Persons and Their Goods 

2407 In economic matters, respect for human dignity requires the 
practice of the virtue of temperance, so as to moderate attachment to 
this world's goods; the practice of the virtue of justice, to preserve our 
neighbor's rights and render him what is his due; and the practice of 
solidarity, in accordance with the golden rule and in keeping with the 
generosity of the Lord, who "though he was rich, yet for your sake . . . 
became poor so that by his poverty, you might become rich."189 

Respect for the goods of others 

2408 The seventh commandment forbids theft, that is, usurping 
another's property against the reasonable will of the owner. There is no 
theft if consent can be presumed or if refusal is contrary to reason and 
the universal destination of goods. This is the case in obvious and 



urgent necessity when the only way to provide for immediate, essential 
needs (food, shelter, clothing . . .) is to put at one's disposal and use 
the property of others.190 

2409 Even if it does not contradict the provisions of civil law, any form 
of unjustly taking and keeping the property of others is against the 
seventh commandment: thus, deliberate retention of goods lent or of 
objects lost; business fraud; paying unjust wages; forcing up prices by 
taking advantage of the ignorance or hardship of another.191 

The following are also morally illicit: speculation in which one 
contrives to manipulate the price of goods artificially in order to gain 
an advantage to the detriment of others; corruption in which one 
influences the judgment of those who must make decisions according 
to law; appropriation and use for private purposes of the common 
goods of an enterprise; work poorly done; tax evasion; forgery of 
checks and invoices; excessive expenses and waste. Willfully damaging 
private or public property is contrary to the moral law and requires 
reparation. 

2410 Promises must be kept and contracts strictly observed to the 
extent that the commitments made in them are morally just. A 
significant part of economic and social life depends on the honoring of 
contracts between physical or moral persons - commercial contracts of 
purchase or sale, rental or labor contracts. All contracts must be agreed 
to and executed in good faith. 

2411 Contracts are subject to commutative justice which regulates 
exchanges between persons and between institutions in accordance 
with a strict respect for their rights. Commutative justice obliges 
strictly; it requires safeguarding property rights, paying debts, and 
fulfilling obligations freely contracted. Without commutative justice, no 
other form of justice is possible. 

One distinguishes commutative justice from legal justice which 
concerns what the citizen owes in fairness to the community, and from 
distributive justice which regulates what the community owes its 
citizens in proportion to their contributions and needs. 

2412 In virtue of commutative justice, reparation for injustice 
committed requires the restitution of stolen goods to their owner: 



Jesus blesses Zacchaeus for his pledge: "If I have defrauded anyone of 
anything, I restore it fourfold."192 Those who, directly or indirectly, 
have taken possession of the goods of another, are obliged to make 
restitution of them, or to return the equivalent in kind or in money, if 
the goods have disappeared, as well as the profit or advantages their 
owner would have legitimately obtained from them. Likewise, all who 
in some manner have taken part in a theft or who have knowingly 
benefited from it - for example, those who ordered it, assisted in it, or 
received the stolen goods - are obliged to make restitution in 
proportion to their responsibility and to their share of what was stolen. 

2413 Games of chance (card games, etc.) or wagers are not in 
themselves contrary to justice. They become morally unacceptable 
when they deprive someone of what is necessary to provide for his 
needs and those of others. the passion for gambling risks becoming an 
enslavement. Unfair wagers and cheating at games constitute grave 
matter, unless the damage inflicted is so slight that the one who suffers 
it cannot reasonably consider it significant. 

2414 The seventh commandment forbids acts or enterprises that for 
any reason - selfish or ideological, commercial, or totalitarian - lead to 
the enslavement of human beings, to their being bought, sold and 
exchanged like merchandise, in disregard for their personal dignity. It 
is a sin against the dignity of persons and their fundamental rights to 
reduce them by violence to their productive value or to a source of 
profit. St. Paul directed a Christian master to treat his Christian slave 
"no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother, . . . 
both in the flesh and in the Lord."193 

Respect for the integrity of creation 

2415 The seventh commandment enjoins respect for the integrity of 
creation. Animals, like plants and inanimate beings, are by nature 
destined for the common good of past, present, and future 
humanity.194 Use of the mineral, vegetable, and animal resources of 
the universe cannot be divorced from respect for moral imperatives. 
Man's dominion over inanimate and other living beings granted by the 
Creator is not absolute; it is limited by concern for the quality of life of 
his neighbor, including generations to come; it requires a religious 
respect for the integrity of creation.195 



2416 Animals are God's creatures. He surrounds them with his 
providential care. By their mere existence they bless him and give him 
glory.196 Thus men owe them kindness. We should recall the 
gentleness with which saints like St. Francis of Assisi or St. Philip Neri 
treated animals. 

2417 God entrusted animals to the stewardship of those whom he 
created in his own image.197 Hence it is legitimate to use animals for 
food and clothing. They may be domesticated to help man in his work 
and leisure. Medical and scientific experimentation on animals is a 
morally acceptable practice, if it remains within reasonable limits and 
contributes to caring for or saving human lives. 

2418 It is contrary to human dignity to cause animals to suffer or die 
needlessly. It is likewise unworthy to spend money on them that should 
as a priority go to the relief of human misery. One can love animals; 
one should not direct to them the affection due only to persons.

III. The Social Doctrine of the Church 

2419 "Christian revelation . . . promotes deeper understanding of the 
laws of social living."198 The Church receives from the Gospel the full 
revelation of the truth about man. When she fulfills her mission of 
proclaiming the Gospel, she bears witness to man, in the name of 
Christ, to his dignity and his vocation to the communion of persons. 
She teaches him the demands of justice and peace in conformity with 
divine wisdom. 

2420 The Church makes a moral judgment about economic and social 
matters, "when the fundamental rights of the person or the salvation of 
souls requires it."199 In the moral order she bears a mission distinct 
from that of political authorities: the Church is concerned with the 
temporal aspects of the common good because they are ordered to the 
sovereign Good, our ultimate end. She strives to inspire right attitudes 
with respect to earthly goods and in socio-economic relationships. 

2421 The social doctrine of the Church developed in the nineteenth 
century when the Gospel encountered modern industrial society with 
its new structures for the production of consumer goods, its new 



concept of society, the state and authority, and its new forms of labor 
and ownership. the development of the doctrine of the Church on 
economic and social matters attests the permanent value of the 
Church's teaching at the same time as it attests the true meaning of her 
Tradition, always living and active.200 

2422 The Church's social teaching comprises a body of doctrine, 
which is articulated as the Church interprets events in the course of 
history, with the assistance of the Holy Spirit, in the light of the whole 
of what has been revealed by Jesus Christ.201 This teaching can be 
more easily accepted by men of good will, the more the faithful let 
themselves be guided by it. 

2423 The Church's social teaching proposes principles for reflection; it 
provides criteria for judgment; it gives guidelines for action: 

Any system in which social relationships are determined entirely by 
economic factors is contrary to the nature of the human person and his 
acts.202 

2424 A theory that makes profit the exclusive norm and ultimate end 
of economic activity is morally unacceptable. the disordered desire for 
money cannot but produce perverse effects. It is one of the causes of 
the many conflicts which disturb the social order.203  

A system that "subordinates the basic rights of individuals and of 
groups to the collective organization of production" is contrary to 
human dignity.204 Every practice that reduces persons to nothing 
more than a means of profit enslaves man, leads to idolizing money, 
and contributes to the spread of atheism. "You cannot serve God and 
mammon."205 

2425 The Church has rejected the totalitarian and atheistic ideologies 
associated in modem times with "communism" or "socialism." She has 
likewise refused to accept, in the practice of "capitalism," individualism 
and the absolute primacy of the law of the marketplace over human 
labor.206 Regulating the economy solely by centralized planning 
perverts the basis of social bonds; regulating it solely by the law of the 
marketplace fails social justice, for "there are many human needs which 
cannot be satisfied by the market."207 Reasonable regulation of the 



marketplace and economic initiatives, in keeping with a just hierarchy 
of values and a view to the common good, is to be commended.

IV. Economic Activity and Social Justice 

2426 The development of economic activity and growth in production 
are meant to provide for the needs of human beings. Economic life is 
not meant solely to ultiply goods produced and increase profit or 
power; it is ordered first of all to the service of persons, of the whole 
man, and of the entire human community. Economic activity, 
conducted according to its own proper methods, is to be exercised 
within the limits of the moral order, in keeping with social justice so as 
to correspond to God's plan for man.208 

2427 Human work proceeds directly from persons created in the 
image of God and called to prolong the work of creation by subduing 
the earth, both with and for one another.209 Hence work is a duty: "If 
any one will not work, let him not eat."210 Work honors the Creator's 
gifts and the talents received from him. It can also be redemptive. By 
enduring the hardship of work211 in union with Jesus, the carpenter of 
Nazareth and the one crucified on Calvary, man collaborates in a 
certain fashion with the Son of God in his redemptive work. He shows 
himself to be a disciple of Christ by carrying the cross, daily, in the 
work he is called to accomplish.212 Work can be a means of 
sanctification and a way of animating earthly realities with the Spirit of 
Christ. 

2428 In work, the person exercises and fulfills in part the potential 
inscribed in his nature. the primordial value of labor stems from man 
himself, its author and its beneficiary. Work is for man, not man for 
work.213  



Everyone should be able to draw from work the means of providing for 
his life and that of his family, and of serving the human community. 

2429 Everyone has the right of economic initiative; everyone should 
make legitimate use of his talents to contribute to the abundance that 
will benefit all and to harvest the just fruits of his labor. He should seek 
to observe regulations issued by legitimate authority for the sake of the 
common good.214 

2430 Economic life brings into play different interests, often opposed 
to one another. This explains why the conflicts that characterize it 
arise.215 Efforts should be made to reduce these conflicts by 
negotiation that respects the rights and duties of each social partner: 
those responsible for business enterprises, representatives of wage - 
earners (for example, trade unions), and public authorities when 
appropriate. 

2431 The responsibility of the state. "Economic activity, especially the 
activity of a market economy, cannot be conducted in an institutional, 
juridical, or political vacuum. On the contrary, it presupposes sure 
guarantees of individual freedom and private property, as well as a 
stable currency and efficient public services. Hence the principal task 
of the state is to guarantee this security, so that those who work and 
produce can enjoy the fruits of their labors and thus feel encouraged to 
work efficiently and honestly.... Another task of the state is that of 
overseeing and directing the exercise of human rights in the economic 
sector. However, primary responsibility in this area belongs not to the 
state but to individuals and to the various groups and associations 
which make up society."216 

2432 Those responsible for business enterprises are responsible to 
society for the economic and ecological effects of their operations.217 
They have an obligation to consider the good of persons and not only 
the increase of profits. Profits are necessary, however. They make 
possible the investments that ensure the future of a business and they 
guarantee employment. 

2433 Access to employment and to professions must be open to all 
without unjust discrimination: men and women, healthy and disabled, 



natives and immigrants.218 For its part society should, according to 
circumstances, help citizens find work and employment.219 

2434 A just wage is the legitimate fruit of work. To refuse or withhold 
it can be a grave injustice.220 In determining fair pay both the needs 
and the contributions of each person must be taken into account. 
"Remuneration for work should guarantee man the opportunity to 
provide a dignified livelihood for himself and his family on the 
material, social, cultural and spiritual level, taking into account the role 
and the productivity of each, the state of the business, and the 
common good."221 Agreement between the parties is not sufficient to 
justify morally the amount to be received in wages. 

2435 Recourse to a strike is morally legitimate when it cannot be 
avoided, or at least when it is necessary to obtain a proportionate 
benefit. It becomes morally unacceptable when accompanied by 
violence, or when objectives are included that are not directly linked to 
working conditions or are contrary to the common good.  

2436 Unemployment almost always wounds its victim's dignity and 
threatens the equilibrium of his life. Besides the harm done to him 
personally, it entails many risks for his family.222

V. Justice and Solidarity Among Nations 

2437 On the international level, inequality of resources and economic 
capability is such that it creates a real "gap" between nations.223 On 
the one side there are those nations possessing and developing the 
means of growth and, on the other, those accumulating debts. 

2438 Various causes of a religious, political, economic, and financial 
nature today give "the social question a worldwide dimension."224 
There must be solidarity among nations which are already politically 
interdependent. It is even more essential when it is a question of 
dismantling the "perverse mechanisms" that impede the development 
of the less advanced countries.225 In place of abusive if not usurious 
financial systems, iniquitous commercial relations among nations, and 
the arms race, there must be substituted a common effort to mobilize 
resources toward objectives of moral, cultural, and economic 
development, "redefining the priorities and hierarchies of values."226 

2439 Rich nations have a grave moral responsibility toward those 
which are unable to ensure the means of their development by 
themselves or have been prevented from doing so by tragic historical 
events. It is a duty in solidarity and charity; it is also an obligation in 
justice if the prosperity of the rich nations has come from resources 
that have not been paid for fairly. 

2440 Direct aid is an appropriate response to immediate, extraordinary 
needs caused by natural catastrophes, epidemics, and the like. But it 
does not suffice to repair the grave damage resulting from destitution 
or to provide a lasting solution to a country's needs. It is also necessary 



to reform international economic and financial institutions so that they 
will better promote equitable relationships with less advanced 
countries.227 The efforts of poor countries working for growth and 
liberation must be supported.228 This doctrine must be applied 
especially in the area of agricultural labor. Peasants, especially in the 
Third World, form the overwhelming majority of the poor. 

2441 An increased sense of God and increased self-awareness are 
fundamental to any full development of human society. This 
development multiplies material goods and puts them at the service of 
the person and his freedom. It reduces dire poverty and economic 
exploitation. It makes for growth in respect for cultural identities and 
openness to the transcendent.229 

2442 It is not the role of the Pastors of the Church to intervene 
directly in the political structuring and organization of social life. This 
task is part of the vocation of the lay faithful, acting on their own 
initiative with their fellow citizens. Social action can assume various 
concrete forms. It should always have the common good in view and 
be in conformity with the message of the Gospel and the teaching of 
the Church. It is the role of the laity "to animate temporal realities with 
Christian commitment, by which they show that they are witnesses and 
agents of peace and justice."230

VI. Love For the Poor 

2443 God blesses those who come to the aid of the poor and rebukes 
those who turn away from them: "Give to him who begs from you, do 
not refuse him who would borrow from you"; "you received without 
pay, give without pay."231 It is by what they have done for the poor 
that Jesus Christ will recognize his chosen ones.232 When "the poor 
have the good news preached to them," it is the sign of Christ's 
presence.233 

2444 "The Church's love for the poor . . . is a part of her constant 
tradition." This love is inspired by the Gospel of the Beatitudes, of the 
poverty of Jesus, and of his concern for the poor.234 Love for the poor 
is even one of the motives for the duty of working so as to "be able to 
give to those in need."235 It extends not only to material poverty but 
also to the many forms of cultural and religious poverty.236 

2445 Love for the poor is incompatible with immoderate love of riches 
or their selfish use: 

Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming 
upon you. Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten. 
Your gold and silver have rusted, and their rust will be evidence against 



you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure for the 
last days. Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, 
which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the harvesters 
have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. You have lived on the earth 
in luxury and in pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of 
slaughter. You have condemned, you have killed the righteous man; he 
does not resist you.237 

2446 St. John Chrysostom vigorously recalls this: "Not to enable the 
poor to share in our goods is to steal from them and deprive them of 
life. the goods we possess are not ours, but theirs."238 "The demands 
of justice must be satisfied first of all; that which is already due in 
justice is not to be offered as a gift of charity":239 

When we attend to the needs of those in want, we give them what is 
theirs, not ours. More than performing works of mercy, we are paying a 
debt of justice.240 

2447 The works of mercy are charitable actions by which we come to 
the aid of our neighbor in his spiritual and bodily necessities.241 
Instructing, advising, consoling, comforting are spiritual works of 
mercy, as are forgiving and bearing wrongs patiently. the corporal 
works of mercy consist especially in feeding the hungry, sheltering the 
homeless, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and imprisoned, and 
burying the dead.242 Among all these, giving alms to the poor is one 
of the chief witnesses to fraternal charity: it is also a work of justice 
pleasing to God:243 

He who has two coats, let him share with him who has none and he 
who has food must do likewise.244 But give for alms those things 
which are within; and behold, everything is clean for you.245 If a 
brother or sister is ill-clad and in lack of daily food, and one of you says 
to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled," without giving them the 
things needed for the body, what does it profit?246 

2448 "In its various forms - material deprivation, unjust oppression, 
physical and psychological illness and death - human misery is the 
obvious sign of the inherited condition of frailty and need for salvation 
in which man finds himself as a consequence of original sin. This 
misery elicited the compassion of Christ the Savior, who willingly took 



it upon himself and identified himself with the least of his brethren. 
Hence, those who are oppressed by poverty are the object of a 
preferential love on the part of the Church which, since her origin and 
in spite of the failings of many of her members, has not ceased to work 
for their relief, defense, and liberation through numerous works of 
charity which remain indispensable always and everywhere."247 

2449 Beginning with the Old Testament, all kinds of juridical measures 
(the jubilee year of forgiveness of debts, prohibition of loans at interest 
and the keeping of collateral, the obligation to tithe, the daily payment 
of the day-laborer, the right to glean vines and fields) answer the 
exhortation of Deuteronomy: "For the poor will never cease out of the 
land; therefore I command you, 'You shall open wide your hand to 
your brother, to the needy and to the poor in the land.'"248 Jesus 
makes these words his own: "The poor you always have with you, but 
you do not always have me."249 In so doing he does not soften the 
vehemence of former oracles against "buying the poor for silver and the 
needy for a pair of sandals . . .," but invites us to recognize his own 
presence in the poor who are his brethren:250 

When her mother reproached her for caring for the poor and the sick 
at home, St. Rose of Lima said to her: "When we serve the poor and 
the sick, we serve Jesus. We must not fail to help our neighbors, 
because in them we serve Jesus.251

Article 7 THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT 



 

 

IN BRIEF 

2450 "You shall not steal" (Ex 20:15; Deut 5:19). "Neither thieves, nor 
the greedy, nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of God" (1 Cor 6:10). 

2451 The seventh commandment enjoins the practice of justice and 
charity in the administration of earthly goods and the fruits of men's 
labor. 

2452 The goods of creation are destined for the entire human race. the 
right to private property does not abolish the universal destination of 
goods. 

2453 The seventh commandment forbids theft. Theft is the usurpation 
of another's goods against the reasonable will of the owner. 

2454 Every manner of taking and using another's property unjustly is 
contrary to the seventh commandment. the injustice committed 
requires reparation. Commutative justice requires the restitution of 
stolen goods. 

2455 The moral law forbids acts which, for commercial or totalitarian 
purposes, lead to the enslavement of human beings, or to their being 
bought, sold or exchanged like merchandise. 

2456 The dominion granted by the Creator over the mineral, 
vegetable, and animal resources of the universe cannot be separated 
from respect for moral obligations, including those toward generations 
to come. 

2457 Animals are entrusted to man's stewardship; he must show them 
kindness. They may be used to serve the just satisfaction of man's 
needs. 

2458 The Church makes a judgment about economic and social 
matters when the fundamental rights of the person or the salvation of 
souls requires *. She is concerned with the temporal common good of 
men because they are ordered to the sovereign Good, their ultimate 
end. 



2459 Man is himself the author, center, and goal of all economic and 
social life. the decisive point of the social question is that goods created 
by God for everyone should in fact reach everyone in accordance with 
justice and with the help of charity. 

2460 The primordial value of labor stems from man himself, its author 
and beneficiary. By means of his labor man participates in the work of 
creation. Work united to Christ can be redemptive. 

2461 True development concerns the whole man. It is concerned with 
increasing each person's ability to respond to his vocation and hence to 
God's call (cf CA 29). 

2462 Giving alms to the poor is a witness to fraternal charity: it is also 
a work of justice pleasing to God. 

2463 How can we not recognize Lazarus, the hungry beggar in the 
parable (cf Lk 17:19-31), in the multitude of human beings without 
bread, a roof or a place to stay? How can we fail to hear Jesus: "As you 
did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to me" (Mt 25:45)?

Article 8 THE EIGHTH COMMANDMENT 

You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.252 

  

It was said to the men of old, "You shall not swear falsely, but shall 
perform to the Lord what you have sworn."253 

2464 The eighth commandment forbids misrepresenting the truth in 
our relations with others. This moral prescription flows from the 
vocation of the holy people to bear witness to their God who is the 
truth and wills the truth. Offenses against the truth express by word or 
deed a refusal to commit oneself to moral uprightness: they are

I. Living in the Truth 

2465 The Old Testament attests that God is the source of all truth. His 
Word is truth. His Law is truth. His "faithfulness endures to all 
generations."254 Since God is "true," the members of his people are 
called to live in the truth.255 

2466 In Jesus Christ, the whole of God's truth has been made 
manifest. "Full of grace and truth," he came as the "light of the world," 
he is the Truth.256 "Whoever believes in me may not remain in 
darkness."257 The disciple of Jesus continues in his word so as to know 
"the truth [that] will make you free" and that sanctifies.258 To follow 
Jesus is to live in "the Spirit of truth," whom the Father sends in his 
name and who leads "into all the truth."259 To his disciples Jesus 
teaches the unconditional love of truth: "Let what you say be simply 
'Yes or No.'"260 

2467 Man tends by nature toward the truth. He is obliged to honor 
and bear witness to it: "It is in accordance with their dignity that all 
men, because they are persons . . . are both impelled by their nature 
and bound by a moral obligation to seek the truth, especially religious 
truth. They are also bound to adhere to the truth once they come to 
know it and direct their whole lives in accordance with the demands of 
truth."261 

2468 Truth as uprightness in human action and speech is called 
truthfulness, sincerity, or candor. Truth or truthfulness is the virtue 
which consists in showing oneself true in deeds and truthful in words, 
and in guarding against duplicity, dissimulation, and hypocrisy. 

2469 "Men could not live with one another if there were not mutual 
confidence that they were being truthful to one another."262 The 
virtue of truth gives another his just due. Truthfulness keeps to the just 
mean between what ought to be expressed and what ought to be kept 
secret: it entails honesty and discretion. In justice, "as a matter of 
honor, one man owes it to another to manifest the truth."263 

2470 The disciple of Christ consents to "live in the truth," that is, in 
the simplicity of a life in conformity with the Lord's example, abiding 
in his truth. "If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in 
darkness, we lie and do not live according to the truth."264

II. To Bear Witness to the Truth 

2471 Before Pilate, Christ proclaims that he "has come into the world, 
to bear witness to the truth."265 The Christian is not to "be ashamed 
then of testifying to our Lord."266 In situations that require witness to 
the faith, the Christian must profess it without equivocation, after the 
example of St. Paul before his judges. We must keep "a clear conscience 
toward God and toward men."267 

2472 The duty of Christians to take part in the life of the Church 
impels them to act as witnesses of the Gospel and of the obligations 
that flow from it. This witness is a transmission of the faith in words 
and deeds. Witness is an act of justice that establishes the truth or 
makes it known.268  

All Christians by the example of their lives and the witness of their 
word, wherever they live, have an obligation to manifest the new man 
which they have put on in Baptism and to reveal the power of the Holy 
Spirit by whom they were strengthened at Confirmation. 

2473 Martyrdom is the supreme witness given to the truth of the faith: 
it means bearing witness even unto death. the martyr bears witness to 
Christ who died and rose, to whom he is united by charity. He bears 
witness to the truth of the faith and of Christian doctrine. He endures 
death through an act of fortitude. "Let me become the food of the 
beasts, through whom it will be given me to reach God."270 



2474 The Church has painstakingly collected the records of those who 
persevered to the end in witnessing to their faith. These are the acts of 
the Martyrs. They form the archives of truth written in letters of blood: 

Neither the pleasures of the world nor the kingdoms of this age will be 
of any use to me. 

It is better for me to die [in order to unite myself] to Christ Jesus than 
to reign over the ends of the earth. I seek him who died for us; I desire 
him who rose for us. My birth is approaching. . .271 I bless you for 
having judged me worthy from this day and this hour to be counted 
among your martyrs.... You have kept your promise, God of 
faithfulness and truth. For this reason and for everything, I praise you, 
I bless you, I glorify you through the eternal and heavenly High Priest, 
Jesus Christ, your beloved Son. Through him, who is with you and the 
Holy Spirit, may glory be given to you, now and in the ages to come. 
Amen.272

III. Offenses Against Truth 

2475 Christ's disciples have "put on the new man, created after the 
likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness."273 By "putting 
away falsehood," they are to "put away all malice and all guile and 
insincerity and envy and all slander."274 

2476 False witness and perjury. When it is made publicly, a statement 
contrary to the truth takes on a particular gravity. In court it becomes 
false witness.275 When it is under oath, it is perjury. Acts such as these 
contribute to condemnation of the innocent, exoneration of the guilty, 
or the increased punishment of the accused.276 They gravely 
compromise the exercise of justice and the fairness of judicial 
decisions. 

2477 Respect for the reputation of persons forbids every attitude and 
word likely to cause them unjust injury.277 He becomes guilty:  

- of rash judgment who, even tacitly, assumes as true, without sufficient 
foundation, the moral fault of a neighbor;  

- of detraction who, without objectively valid reason, discloses 
another's faults and failings to persons who did not know them;278  

- of calumny who, by remarks contrary to the truth, harms the 
reputation of others and gives occasion for false judgments concerning 
them. 



2478 To avoid rash judgment, everyone should be careful to interpret 
insofar as possible his neighbor's thoughts, words, and deeds in a 
favorable way: 

Every good Christian ought to be more ready to give a favorable 
interpretation to another's statement than to condemn it. But if he 
cannot do so, let him ask how the other understands it. and if the latter 
understands it badly, let the former correct him with love. If that does 
not suffice, let the Christian try all suitable ways to bring the other to a 
correct interpretation so that he may be saved.279 

2479 Detraction and calumny destroy the reputation and honor of 
one's neighbor. Honor is the social witness given to human dignity, and 
everyone enjoys a natural right to the honor of his name and 
reputation and to respect. Thus, detraction and calumny offend against 
the virtues of justice and charity. 

2480 Every word or attitude is forbidden which by flattery, adulation, 
or complaisance encourages and confirms another in malicious acts 
and perverse conduct. Adulation is a grave fault if it makes one an 
accomplice in another's vices or grave sins. Neither the desire to be of 
service nor friendship justifies duplicitous speech. Adulation is a venial 
sin when it only seeks to be agreeable, to avoid evil, to meet a need, or 
to obtain legitimate advantages. 

2481 Boasting or bragging is an offense against truth. So is irony 
aimed at disparaging someone by maliciously caricaturing some aspect 
of his behavior. 

2482 "A lie consists in speaking a falsehood with the intention of 
deceiving."280 The Lord denounces lying as the work of the devil: 
"You are of your father the devil, . . . there is no truth in him. When he 
lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the 
father of lies."281 

2483 Lying is the most direct offense against the truth. To lie is to 
speak or act against the truth in order to lead someone into error. By 
injuring man's relation to truth and to his neighbor, a lie offends 
against the fundamental relation of man and of his word to the Lord. 



2484 The gravity of a lie is measured against the nature of the truth it 
deforms, the circumstances, the intentions of the one who lies, and the 
harm suffered by its victims. If a lie in itself only constitutes a venial 
sin, it becomes mortal when it does grave injury to the virtues of 
justice and charity. 

2485 By its very nature, lying is to be condemned. It is a profanation of 
speech, whereas the purpose of speech is to communicate known truth 
to others. the deliberate intention of leading a neighbor into error by 
saying things contrary to the truth constitutes a failure in justice and 
charity. the culpability is greater when the intention of deceiving entails 
the risk of deadly consequences for those who are led astray. 

2486 Since it violates the virtue of truthfulness, a lie does real violence 
to another. It affects his ability to know, which is a condition of every 
judgment and decision. It contains the seed of discord and all 
consequent evils. Lying is destructive of society; it undermines trust 
among men and tears apart the fabric of social relationships. 

2487 Every offense committed against justice and truth entails the 
duty of reparation, even if its author has been forgiven. When it is 
impossible publicly to make reparation for a wrong, it must be made 
secretly. If someone who has suffered harm cannot be directly 
compensated, he must be given moral satisfaction in the name of 
charity. This duty of reparation also concerns offenses against another's 
reputation. This reparation, moral and sometimes material, must be 
evaluated in terms of the extent of the damage inflicted. It obliges in 
conscience.

IV. Respect for the Truth 

2488 The right to the communication of the truth is not unconditional. 
Everyone must conform his life to the Gospel precept of fraternal love. 
This requires us in concrete situations to judge whether or not it is 
appropriate to reveal the truth to someone who asks for it. 

2489 Charity and respect for the truth should dictate the response to 
every request for information or communication. the good and safety 
of others, respect for privacy, and the common good are sufficient 



reasons for being silent about what ought not be known or for making 
use of a discreet language. the duty to avoid scandal often commands 
strict discretion. No one is bound to reveal the truth to someone who 
does not have the right to know it.282 

2490 The secret of the sacrament of reconciliation is sacred, and 
cannot be violated under any pretext. "The sacramental seal is 
inviolable; therefore, it is a crime for a confessor in any way to betray a 
penitent by word or in any other manner or for any reason."283 

2491 Professional secrets - for example, those of political office 
holders, soldiers, physicians, and lawyers - or confidential information 
given under the seal of secrecy must be kept, save in exceptional cases 
where keeping the secret is bound to cause very grave harm to the one 
who confided it, to the one who received it or to a third party, and 
where the very grave harm can be avoided only by divulging the truth. 
Even if not confided under the seal of secrecy, private information 
prejudicial to another is not to be divulged without a grave and 
proportionate reason. 

2492 Everyone should observe an appropriate reserve concerning 
persons' private lives. Those in charge of communications should 
maintain a fair balance between the requirements of the common good 
and respect for individual rights. Interference by the media in the 
private lives of persons engaged in political or public activity is to be 
condemned to the extent that it infringes upon heir privacy and 
freedom.

V. The Use of the Social Communications Media 



2493 Within modern society the communications media play a major 
role in information, cultural promotion, and formation. This role is 
increasing, as a result of technological progress, the extent and 
diversity of the news transmitted, and the influence exercised on public 
opinion. 

2494 The information provided by the media is at the service of the 
common good.284 Society has a right to information based on truth, 
freedom, justice, and solidarity: 

The proper exercise of this right demands that the content of the 
communication be true and - within the limits set by justice and 
charity - complete. Further, it should be communicated honestly and 
properly. This means that in the gathering and in the publication of 
news, the moral law and the legitimate rights and dignity of man 
should be upheld.285 

2495 "It is necessary that all members of society meet the demands of 
justice and charity in this domain. They should help, through the 
means of social communication, in the formation and diffusion of 
sound public opinion."286 Solidarity is a consequence of genuine and 
right communication and the free circulation of ideas that further 
knowledge and respect for others. 

2496 The means of social communication (especially the mass media) 
can give rise to a certain passivity among users, making them less than 
vigilant consumers of what is said or shown. Users should practice 
moderation and discipline in their approach to the mass media. They 
will want to form enlightened and correct consciences the more easily 
to resist unwholesome influences. 

2497 By the very nature of their profession, journalists have an 
obligation to serve the truth and not offend against charity in 
disseminating information. They should strive to respect, with equal 
care, the nature of the facts and the limits of critical judgment 
concerning individuals. They should not stoop to defamation. 

2498 "Civil authorities have particular responsibilities in this field 
because of the common good.... It is for the civil authority ... to defend 
and safeguard a true and just freedom of information."287 By 
promulgating laws and overseeing their application, public authorities 



should ensure that "public morality and social progress are not gravely 
endangered" through misuse of the media.288 Civil authorities should 
punish any violation of the rights of individuals to their reputation and 
privacy. They should give timely and reliable reports concerning the 
general good or respond to the well-founded concerns of the people. 
Nothing can justify recourse to disinformation for manipulating public 
opinion through the media. Interventions by public authority should 
avoid injuring the freedom of individuals or groups. 

2499 Moral judgment must condemn the plague of totalitarian states 
which systematically falsify the truth, exercise political control of 
opinion through the media, manipulate defendants and witnesses at 
public trials, and imagine that they secure their tyranny by strangling 
and repressing everything they consider "thought crimes."

VI. Truth, Beauty, and Sacred Art 

2500 The practice of goodness is accompanied by spontaneous 
spiritual joy and moral beauty. Likewise, truth carries with it the joy 
and splendor of spiritual beauty. Truth is beautiful in itself. Truth in 
words, the rational expression of the knowledge of created and 
uncreated reality, is necessary to man, who is endowed with intellect. 
But truth can also find other complementary forms of human 
expression, above all when it is a matter of evoking what is beyond 
words: the depths of the human heart, the exaltations of the soul, the 
mystery of God. Even before revealing himself to man in words of 
truth, God reveals himself to him through the universal language of 
creation, the work of his Word, of his wisdom: the order and harmony 
of the cosmos - which both the child and the scientist discover - "from 
the greatness and beauty of created things comes a corresponding 
perception of their Creator," "for the author of beauty created 
them."289 

[Wisdom] is a breath of the power of God, and a pure emanation of 
the glory of the Almighty; therefore nothing defiled gains entrance into 
her. For she is a reflection of eternal light, a spotless mirror of the 
working of God, and an image of his goodness.290 For [wisdom] is 
more beautiful than the sun, and excels every constellation of the stars. 
Compared with the light she is found to be superior, for it is succeeded 
by the night, but against wisdom evil does not prevail.291 I became 
enamored of her beauty.292 

2501 Created "in the image of God,"293 man also expresses the truth 
of his relationship with God the Creator by the beauty of his artistic 
works. Indeed, art is a distinctively human form of expression; beyond 
the search for the necessities of life which is common to all living 
creatures, art is a freely given superabundance of the human being's 
inner riches. Arising from talent given by the Creator and from man's 
own effort, art is a form of practical wisdom, uniting knowledge and 
skill,294 to give form to the truth of reality in a language accessible to 
sight or hearing. To the extent that it is inspired by truth and love of 
beings, art bears a certain likeness to God's activity in what he has 
created. Like any other human activity, art is not an absolute end in 
itself, but is ordered to and ennobled by the ultimate end of man.295 



2502 Sacred art is true and beautiful when its form corresponds to its 
particular vocation: evoking and glorifying, in faith and adoration, the 
transcendent mystery of God - the surpassing invisible beauty of truth 
and love visible in Christ, who "reflects the glory of God and bears the 
very stamp of his nature," in whom "the whole fullness of deity dwells 
bodily."296 This spiritual beauty of God is reflected in the most holy 
Virgin Mother of God, the angels, and saints. Genuine sacred art 
draws man to adoration, to prayer, and to the love of God, Creator and 
Savior, the Holy One and Sanctifier. 

2503 For this reason bishops, personally or through delegates, should 
see to the promotion of sacred art, old and new, in all its forms and, 
with the same religious care, remove from the liturgy and from places 
of worship everything which is not in conformity with the truth of faith 
and the authentic beauty of sacred art.297

IN BRIEF 

2504 "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor" (Ex 
20:16). Christ's disciples have "put on the new man, created after the 
likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness" (Eph 4:24). 

2505 Truth or truthfulness is the virtue which consists in showing 
oneself true in deeds and truthful in words, and guarding against 
duplicity, dissimulation, and hypocrisy. 

2506 The Christian is not to "be ashamed of testifying to our Lord" (2 
Tim 1:8) in deed and word. Martyrdom is the supreme witness given 
to the truth of the faith. 

2507 Respect for the reputation and honor of persons forbids all 
detraction and calumny in word or attitude. 

2508 Lying consists in saying what is false with the intention of 
deceiving one's neighbor. 

2509 An offense committed against the truth requires reparation. 



2510 The golden rule helps one discern, in concrete situations, 
whether or not it would be appropriate to reveal the truth to someone 
who asks for it. 

2511 "The sacramental seal is inviolable" (CIC, can. 983 # 1). 
Professional secrets must be kept. Confidences prejudicial to another 
are not to be divulged. 

2512 Society has a right to information based on truth, freedom, and 
justice. One should practice moderation and discipline in the use of the 
social communications media. 

2513 The fine arts, but above all sacred art, "of their nature are 
directed toward expressing in some way the infinite beauty of God in 
works made by human hands. Their dedication to the increase of God's 
praise and of his glory is more complete, the more exclusively they are 
devoted to turning men's minds devoutly toward God" (SC 122).

Article 9 

THE NINTH COMMANDMENT 

You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your 
neighbor's wife, or his manservant, or his maidservant, or his ox, or his 
ass, or anything that is your neighbor's.298  

 

Every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed 
adultery with her in his heart.299 

2514 St. John distinguishes three kinds of covetousness or 
concupiscence: lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and pride of life.300 
In the Catholic catechetical tradition, the ninth commandment forbids 
carnal concupiscence; the tenth forbids coveting another's goods. 

2515 Etymologically, "concupiscence" can refer to any intense form of 
human desire. Christian theology has given it a particular meaning: the 
movement of the sensitive appetite contrary to the operation of the 
human reason. the apostle St. Paul identifies it with the rebellion of the 
"flesh" against the "spirit."301 Concupiscence stems from the 
disobedience of the first sin. It unsettles man's moral faculties and, 
without being in itself an offense, inclines man to commit sins.302 

2516 Because man is a composite being, spirit and body, there already 
exists a certain tension in him; a certain struggle of tendencies between 
"spirit" and "flesh" develops. But in fact this struggle belongs to the 
heritage of sin. It is a consequence of sin and at the same time a 
confirmation of it. It is part of the daily experience of the spiritual 
battle: 



For the Apostle it is not a matter of despising and condemning the 
body which with the spiritual soul constitutes man's nature and 
personal subjectivity. Rather, he is concerned with the morally good or 
bad works, or better, the permanent dispositions - virtues and vices - 
which are the fruit of submission (in the first case) or of resistance (in 
the second case) to the saving action of the Holy Spirit. For this reason 
the Apostle writes: "If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the 
Spirit."303

I. Purification of the Heart 



2517 The heart is the seat of moral personality: "Out of the heart come 
evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication...."304 The struggle against 
carnal covetousness entails purifying the heart and practicing 
temperance: 

Remain simple and innocent, and you will be like little children who 
do not know the evil that destroys man's life.305 

2518 The sixth beatitude proclaims, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for 
they shall see God."306 "Pure in heart" refers to those who have 
attuned their intellects and wills to the demands of God's holiness, 
chiefly in three areas: charity;307 chastity or sexual rectitude;308 love 
of truth and orthodoxy of faith.309 There is a connection between 
purity of heart, of body, and of faith: 

The faithful must believe the articles of the Creed "so that by believing 
they may obey God, by obeying may live well, by living well may purify 
their hearts, and with pure hearts may understand what they 
believe."310 

2519 The "pure in heart" are promised that they will see God face to 
face and be like him.311 Purity of heart is the precondition of the 
vision of God. Even now it enables us to see according to God, to 
accept others as "neighbors"; it lets us perceive the human body - ours 
and our neighbor's - as a temple of the Holy Spirit, a manifestation of 
divine beauty.

II. The Battle for Purity 

2520 Baptism confers on its recipient the grace of purification from all 
sins. But the baptized must continue to struggle against concupiscence 
of the flesh and disordered desires. With God's grace he will prevail  

- by the virtue and gift of chastity, for chastity lets us love with upright 
and undivided heart;  

- by purity of intention which consists in seeking the true end of man: 
with simplicity of vision, the baptized person seeks to find and to fulfill 
God's will in everything;312  

- by purity of vision, external and internal; by discipline of feelings and 
imagination; by refusing all complicity in impure thoughts that incline 
us to turn aside from the path of God's commandments: "Appearance 
arouses yearning in fools";313  



- by prayer: 

I thought that continence arose from one's own powers, which I did 
not recognize in myself. I was foolish enough not to know . . . that no 
one can be continent unless you grant it. For you would surely have 
granted it if my inner groaning had reached your ears and I with firm 
faith had cast my cares on you.314 

2521 Purity requires modesty, an integral part of temperance. Modesty 
protects the intimate center of the person. It means refusing to unveil 
what should remain hidden. It is ordered to chastity to whose 
sensitivity it bears witness. It guides how one looks at others and 
behaves toward them in conformity with the dignity of persons and 
their solidarity. 

2522 Modesty protects the mystery of persons and their love. It 
encourages patience and moderation in loving relationships; it requires 
that the conditions for the definitive giving and commitment of man 
and woman to one another be fulfilled. Modesty is decency. It inspires 
one's choice of clothing. It keeps silence or reserve where there is 
evident risk of unhealthy curiosity. It is discreet. 

2523 There is a modesty of the feelings as well as of the body. It 
protests, for example, against the voyeuristic explorations of the human 
body in certain advertisements, or against the solicitations of certain 
media that go too far in the exhibition of intimate things. Modesty 
inspires a way of life which makes it possible to resist the allurements 
of fashion and the pressures of prevailing ideologies. 

2524 The forms taken by modesty vary from one culture to another. 
Everywhere, however, modesty exists as an intuition of the spiritual 
dignity proper to man. It is born with the awakening consciousness of 
being a subject. Teaching modesty to children and adolescents means 
awakening in them respect for the human person. 

2525 Christian purity requires a purification of the social climate. It 
requires of the communications media that their presentations show 
concern for respect and restraint. Purity of heart brings freedom from 
widespread eroticism and avoids entertainment inclined to voyeurism 
and illusion. 



2526 So called moral permissiveness rests on an erroneous conception 
of human freedom; the necessary precondition for the development of 
true freedom is to let oneself be educated in the moral law. Those in 
charge of education can reasonably be expected to give young people 
instruction respectful of the truth, the qualities of the heart, and the 
moral and spiritual dignity of man. 

2527 "The Good News of Christ continually renews the life and 
culture of fallen man; it combats and removes the error and evil which 
flow from the ever-present attraction of sin. It never ceases to purify 
and elevate the morality of peoples. It takes the spiritual qualities and 
endowments of every age and nation, and with supernatural riches it 
causes them to blossom, as it were, from within; it fortifies, completes, 
and restores them in Christ."315

IN BRIEF 

2528 "Everyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed 
adultery with her in his heart" (Mt 5:28). 



2529 The ninth commandment warns against lust or carnal 
concupiscence. 

2530 The struggle against carnal lust involves purifying the heart and 
practicing temperance. 

2531 Purity of heart will enable us to see God: it enables us even now 
to see things according to God. 

2532 Purification of the heart demands prayer, the practice of chastity, 
purity of intention and of vision. 

2533 Purity of heart requires the modesty which is patience, decency, 
and discretion. Modesty protects the intimate center of the person.

Article 10 THE TENTH COMMANDMENT 

You shall not covet ... anything that is your neighbor's.... 

You shall not desire your neighbor's house, his field, or his manservant, 
or his maidservant,, or his ox, or his ass, or anything that is your 
neighbor's.316  

 

For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.317 

2534 The tenth commandment unfolds and completes the ninth, 
which is concerned with concupiscence of the flesh. It forbids coveting 
the goods of another, as the root of theft, robbery, and fraud, which the 
seventh commandment forbids. "Lust of the eyes" leads to the violence 
and injustice forbidden by the fifth commandment.318 Avarice, like 
fornication, originates in the idolatry prohibited by the first three 
prescriptions of the Law.319 The tenth commandment concerns the 
intentions of the heart; with the ninth, it summarizes all the precepts of 
the Law.

Article 10 THE TENTH COMMANDMENT 

 

 

I. The Disorder of Covetous Desires 

2535 The sensitive appetite leads us to desire pleasant things we do not 
have, e.g., the desire to eat when we are hungry or to warm ourselves 
when we are cold. These desires are good in themselves; but often they 
exceed the limits of reason and drive us to covet unjustly what is not 
ours and belongs to another or is owed to him. 

2536 The tenth commandment forbids greed and the desire to amass 
earthly goods without limit. It forbids avarice arising from a passion for 
riches and their attendant power. It also forbids the desire to commit 
injustice by harming our neighbor in his temporal goods: 

When the Law says, "You shall not covet," these words mean that we 
should banish our desires for whatever does not belong to us. Our 
thirst for another's goods is immense, infinite, never quenched. Thus it 
is written: "He who loves money never has money enough."320 

2537 It is not a violation of this commandment to desire to obtain 
things that belong to one's neighbor, provided this is done by just 
means. Traditional catechesis realistically mentions "those who have a 
harder struggle against their criminal desires" and so who "must be 
urged the more to keep this commandment": 

. . . merchants who desire scarcity and rising prices, who cannot bear 
not to be the only ones buying and selling so that they themselves can 
sell more dearly and buy more cheaply; those who hope that their peers 
will be impoverished, in order to realize a profit either by selling to 
them or buying from them . . . physicians who wish disease to spread; 
lawyers who are eager for many important cases and trials.321 

2538 The tenth commandment requires that envy be banished from 
the human heart. When the prophet Nathan wanted to spur King 
David to repentance, he told him the story about the poor man who 



had only one ewe lamb that he treated like his own daughter and the 
rich man who, despite the great number of his flocks, envied the poor 
man and ended by stealing his lamb.322 Envy can lead to the worst 
crimes.323 "Through the devil's envy death entered the world":324 

We fight one another, and envy arms us against one another.... If 
everyone strives to unsettle the Body of Christ, where shall we end up? 
We are engaged in making Christ's Body a corpse.... We declare 
ourselves members of one and the same organism, yet we devour one 
another like beasts.325 

2539 Envy is a capital sin. It refers to the sadness at the sight of 
another's goods and the immoderate desire to acquire them for oneself, 
even unjustly. When it wishes grave harm to a neighbor it is a mortal 
sin: 

St. Augustine saw envy as "the diabolical sin."326 "From envy are born 
hatred, detraction, calumny, joy caused by the misfortune of a 
neighbor, and displeasure caused by his prosperity."327 

2540 Envy represents a form of sadness and therefore a refusal of 
charity; the baptized person should struggle against it by exercising 
good will. Envy often comes from pride; the baptized person should 
train himself to live in humility: 

Would you like to see God glorified by you? Then rejoice in your 
brother's progress and you will immediately give glory to God. Because 
his servant could conquer envy by rejoicing in the merits of others, 
God will be praised.328

II. The Desires of the Spirit 

2541 The economy of law and grace turns men's hearts away from 
avarice and envy. It initiates them into desire for the Sovereign Good; it 
instructs them in the desires of the Holy Spirit who satisfies man's 
heart.  

The God of the promises always warned man against seduction by 
what from the beginning has seemed "good for food . . . a delight to the 
eyes . . . to be desired to make one wise."329 



2542 The Law entrusted to Israel never sufficed to justify those subject 
to it; it even became the instrument of "lust."330 The gap between 
wanting and doing points to the conflict between God's Law which is 
the "law of my mind," and another law "making me captive to the law 
of sin which dwells in my members."331 

2543 "But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart 
from law, although the law and the prophets bear witness to it, the 
righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who 
believe."332 Henceforth, Christ's faithful "have crucified the flesh with 
its passions and desires"; they are led by the Spirit and follow the 
desires of the Spirit.333

III. Poverty of Heart 



2544 Jesus enjoins his disciples to prefer him to everything and 
everyone, and bids them "renounce all that [they have]" for his sake 
and that of the Gospel.334 Shortly before his passion he gave them the 
example of the poor widow of Jerusalem who, out of her poverty, gave 
all that she had to live on.335 The precept of detachment from riches 
is obligatory for entrance into the Kingdom of heaven. 

2545 All Christ's faithful are to "direct their affections rightly, lest they 
be hindered in their pursuit of perfect charity by the use of worldly 
things and by an adherence to riches which is contrary to the spirit of 
evangelical poverty."336 

2546 "Blessed are the poor in spirit."337 The Beatitudes reveal an 
order of happiness and grace, of beauty and peace. Jesus celebrates the 
joy of the poor, to whom the Kingdom already belongs:338 

The Word speaks of voluntary humility as "poverty in spirit"; the 
Apostle gives an example of God's poverty when he says: "For your 
sakes he became poor."339 

2547 The Lord grieves over the rich, because they find their 
consolation in the abundance of goods.340 "Let the proud seek and 
love earthly kingdoms, but blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the 
Kingdom of heaven."341 Abandonment to the providence of the 
Father in heaven frees us from anxiety about tomorrow.342 Trust in 
God is a preparation for the blessedness of the poor. They shall see 
God.

IV. "I Want to See God" 

2548 Desire for true happiness frees man from his immoderate 
attachment to the goods of this world so that he can find his fulfillment 
in the vision and beatitude of God. "The promise [of seeing God] 
surpasses all beatitude.... In Scripture, to see is to possess.... Whoever 
sees God has obtained all the goods of which he can conceive."343 

2549 It remains for the holy people to struggle, with grace from on 
high, to obtain the good things God promises. In order to possess and 



contemplate God, Christ's faithful mortify their cravings and, with the 
grace of God, prevail over the seductions of pleasure and power. 

2550 On this way of perfection, the Spirit and the Bride call whoever 
hears them344 to perfect communion with God: 

There will true glory be, where no one will be praised by mistake or 
flattery; true honor will not be refused to the worthy, nor granted to 
the unworthy; likewise, no one unworthy will pretend to be worthy, 
where only those who are worthy will be admitted. There true peace 
will reign, where no one will experience opposition either from self or 
others. God himself will be virtue's reward; he gives virtue and has 
promised to give himself as the best and greatest reward that could 
exist.... "I shall be their God and they will be my people...." This is also 
the meaning of the Apostle's words: "So that God may be all in all." 
God himself will be the goal of our desires; we shall contemplate him 
without end, love him without surfeit, praise him without weariness. 
This gift, this state, this act, like eternal life itself, will assuredly be 
common to all.345

IN BRIEF 

2551 "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Mt 6:21). 



2552 The tenth commandment forbids avarice arising from a passion 
for riches and their attendant power. 

2553 Envy is sadness at the sight of another's goods and the 
immoderate desire to have them for oneself. It is a capital sin. 

2554 The baptized person combats envy through good-will, humility, 
and abandonment to the providence of God. 

2555 Christ's faithful "have crucified the flesh with its passions and 
desires"  Gal 5:24); they are led by the Spirit and follow his desires. 

2556 Detachment from riches is necessary for entering the Kingdom 
of heaven. "Blessed are the poor in spirit." 

2557 "I want to see God" expresses the true desire of man. Thirst for 
God is quenched by the water of eternal life (cf In 4:14). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PART FOUR: CHRISTIAN PRAYER 

SECTION ONEPRAYER IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE 

2558 "Great is the mystery of the faith!" 

The Church professes this mystery in the Apostles' Creed (Part One) 
and celebrates it in the sacramental liturgy (Part Two), so that the life 
of the faithful may be conformed to Christ in the Holy Spirit to the 
glory of God the Father (Part Three). 



This mystery, then, requires that the faithful believe in it, that they 
celebrate it, and that they live from it in a vital and personal 
relationship with the living and true God. This relationship is prayer. 

WHAT IS PRAYER? 

For me, prayer is a surge of the heart; 

it is a simple look turned toward heaven,  

it is a cry of recognition and of love,  

embracing both trial and joy.1 

Prayer as God's gift 

2559 "Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God or the 
requesting of good things from God."2  

But when we pray, do we speak from the height of our pride and will, 
or "out of the depths" of a humble and contrite heart?3  

He who humbles himself will be exalted;4 humility is the foundation of 
prayer, 

Only when we humbly acknowledge that "we do not know how to pray 
as we ought,"5 are we ready to receive freely the gift of prayer.  

"Man is a beggar before God."6 

2560 "If you knew the gift of God!"7  

The wonder of prayer is revealed beside the well where we come 
seeking water: there, Christ comes to meet every human being.  

It is he who first seeks us and asks us for a drink. Jesus thirsts; his 
asking arises from the depths of God's desire for us. 

Whether we realize it or not, prayer is the encounter of God's thirst 
with ours. God thirsts that we may thirst for him.8 

2561 "You would have asked him, and he would have given you living 
water."9  

Paradoxically our prayer of petition is a response to the plea of the 
living God:  



"They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewn out 
cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water!"10  

Prayer is the response of faith to the free promise of salvation and also 
a response of love to the thirst of the only Son of God.11 

Prayer as covenant 

2562 Where does prayer come from?  

Whether prayer is expressed in words or gestures, it is the whole man 
who prays.  

But in naming the source of prayer, Scripture speaks sometimes of the 
soul or the spirit, but most often of the heart (more than a thousand 
times).  

According to Scripture, it is the heart that prays.  

If our heart is far from God, the words of prayer are in vain. 

2563 The heart is the dwelling-place where I am, where I live; 
according to the Semitic or Biblical expression, the heart is the place 
"to which I withdraw."  

The heart is our hidden center, beyond the grasp of our reason and of 
others;  

only the Spirit of God can fathom the human heart and know it fully.  

The heart is the place of decision, deeper than our psychic drives.  

It is the place of truth, where we choose life or death.  

It is the place of encounter, because as image of God we live in 
relation:  

it is the place of covenant. 

2564 Christian prayer is a covenant relationship between God and 
man in Christ.  

It is the action of God and of man, springing forth from both the Holy 
Spirit and ourselves, wholly directed to the Father, in union with the 
human will of the Son of God made man. 

Prayer as communion 



2565 In the New Covenant, prayer is the living relationship of the 
children of God with their Father who is good beyond measure, with 
his Son Jesus Christ and with the Holy Spirit.  

The grace of the Kingdom is "the union of the entire holy and royal 
Trinity . . . with the whole human spirit."12  

Thus, the life of prayer is the habit of being in the presence of the 
thrice-holy God and in communion with him.  

This communion of life is always possible because, through Baptism, 
we have already been united with Christ.13  

Prayer is Christian insofar as it is communion with Christ and extends 
throughout the Church, which is his Body.  

Its dimensions are those of Christ's love.14

CHAPTER ONE 

THE REVELATION OF PRAYER - THE UNIVERSAL CALL TO 
PRAYER 

2566 Man is in search of God. In the act of creation, God calls every 
being from nothingness into existence. "Crowned with glory and 
honor," man is, after the angels, capable of acknowledging "how 
majestic is the name of the Lord in all the earth."1 Even after losing 
through his sin his likeness to God, man remains an image of his 



Creator, and retains the desire for the one who calls him into existence. 
All religions bear witness to men's essential search for God.2 

2567 God calls man first. Man may forget his Creator or hide far from 
his face; he may run after idols or accuse the deity of having 
abandoned him; yet the living and true God tirelessly calls each person 
to that mysterious encounter known as prayer. In prayer, the faithful 
God's initiative of love always comes first; our own first step is always a 
response. As God gradually reveals himself and reveals man to himself, 
prayer appears as a reciprocal call, a covenant drama. Through words 
and actions, this drama engages the heart. It unfolds throughout the 
whole history of salvation.

SECTION ONE PRAYER IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE 

 

 

 

CHAPTER ONE THE REVELATION OF PRAYER - THE 
UNIVERSAL CALL TO PRAYER 

 

 

Article 1 IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 

2568 In the Old Testament, the revelation of prayer comes between the 
fall and the restoration of man, that is, between God's sorrowful call to 
his first children: "Where are you? . . . What is this that you have one?"3 
and the response of God's only Son on coming into the world: "Lo, I 
have come to do your will, O God."4 Prayer is bound up with human 
history, for it is the relationship with God in historical events. 

Creation - source of prayer 

2569 Prayer is lived in the first place beginning with the realities of 
creation. the first nine chapters of Genesis describe this relationship 
with God as an offering of the first-born of Abel's flock, as the 
invocation of the divine name at the time of Enosh, and as "walking 
with God.5 Noah's offering is pleasing to God, who blesses him and 
through him all creation, because his heart was upright and undivided; 
Noah, like Enoch before him, "walks with God."6 This kind of prayer is 
lived by many righteous people in all religions.  

In his indefectible covenant with every living creature,7 God has 
always called people to prayer. But it is above all beginning with our 
father Abraham that prayer is revealed in the Old Testament. 

God's promise and the prayer of Faith 



2570 When God calls him, Abraham goes forth "as the Lord had told 
him";8 Abraham's heart is entirely submissive to the Word and so he 
obeys. Such attentiveness of the heart, whose decisions are made 
according to God's will, is essential to prayer, while the words used 
count only in relation to it. Abraham's prayer is expressed first by 
deeds: a man of silence, he constructs an altar to the Lord at each stage 
of his journey. Only later does Abraham's first prayer in words appear: 
a veiled complaint reminding God of his promises which seem 
unfulfilled.9 Thus one aspect of the drama of prayer appears from the 
beginning: the test of faith in the fidelity of God. 

2571 Because Abraham believed in God and walked in his presence 
and in covenant with him,10 The patriarch is ready to welcome a 
mysterious Guest into his tent. Abraham's remarkable hospitality at 
Mamre foreshadows the annunciation of the true Son of the 
promise.11 After that, once God had confided his plan, Abraham's 
heart is attuned to his Lord's compassion for men and he dares to 
intercede for them with bold confidence.12 

2572 As a final stage in the purification of his faith, Abraham, "who 
had received the promises,"13 is asked to sacrifice the son God had 
given him. Abraham's faith does not weaken (“God himself will 
provide the lamb for a burnt offering."), for he "considered that God 
was able to raise men even from the dead."14 and so the father of 
believers is conformed to the likeness of the Father who will not spare 
his own Son but wiLl deliver him up for us all.15 Prayer restores man 
to God's likeness and enables him to share in the power of God's love 
that saves the multitude.16 

2573 God renews his promise to Jacob, the ancestor of the twelve 
tribes of Israel.17 Before confronting his elder brother Esau, Jacob 
wrestles all night with a mysterious figure who refuses to reveal his 
name, but he blesses him before leaving him at dawn. From this 
account, the spiritual tradition of the Church has retained the symbol 
of prayer as a battle of faith and as the triumph of perseverance.18 

Moses and the prayer of the mediator 

2574 Once the promise begins to be fulfilled (Passover, the Exodus, 
the gift of the Law, and the ratification of the covenant), the prayer of 



Moses becomes the most striking example of intercessory prayer, 
which will be fulfilled in "the one mediator between God and men, the 
man Christ Jesus."19 

2575 Here again the initiative is God's. From the midst of the burning 
bush he calls Moses.20 This event will remain one of the primordial 
images of prayer in the spiritual tradition of Jews and Christians alike. 
When "the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob" calls Moses to be 
his servant, it is because he is the living God who wants men to live. 
God reveals himself in order to save them, though he does not do this 
alone or despite them: he caLls Moses to be his messenger, an 
associate in his compassion, his work of salvation. There is something 
of a divine plea in this mission, and only after long debate does Moses 
attune his own will to that of the Savior God. But in the dialogue in 
which God confides in him, Moses also learns how to pray: he balks, 
makes excuses, above all questions: and it is in response to his question 
that the Lord confides his ineffable name, which will be revealed 
through his mighty deeds. 

2576 "Thus the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man 
speaks to his friend."21 Moses' prayer is characteristic of contemplative 
prayer by which God's servant remains faithful to his mission. Moses 
converses with God often and at length, climbing the mountain to hear 
and entreat him and coming down to the people to repeat the words of 
his God for their guidance. Moses "is entrusted with all my house. 
With him I speak face to face, clearly, not in riddles," for "Moses was 
very humble, more so than anyone else on the face of the earth."22 

2577 From this intimacy with the faithful God, slow to anger and 
abounding in steadfast love,23 Moses drew strength and determination 
for his intercession. He does not pray for himself but for the people 
whom God made his own. Moses already intercedes for them during 
the battle with the Amalekites and prays to obtain healing for 
Miriam.24 But it is chiefly after their apostasy that Moses "stands in 
the breach" before God in order to save the people.25 The arguments 
of his prayer - for intercession is also a mysterious battle - will inspire 
the boldness of the great intercessors among the Jewish people and in 
the Church: God is love; he is therefore righteous and faithful; he 
cannot contradict himself; he must remember his marvellous deeds, 



since his glory is at stake, and he cannot forsake this people that bears 
his name. 

David and the prayer of the king 

2578 The prayer of the People of God flourishes in the shadow of 
God's dwelling place, first the ark of the covenant and later the Temple. 
At first the leaders of the people - the shepherds and the prophets - 
teach them to pray. the infant Samuel must have learned from his 
mother Hannah how "to stand before the LORD" and from the priest 
Eli how to listen to his word: "Speak, LORD, for your servant is 
listening."26 Later, he will also know the cost and consequence of 
intercession: "Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin 
against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you; and I will instruct you in 
the good and the right way."27 

2579 David is par excellence the king "after God's own heart," the 
shepherd who prays for his people and prays in their name. His 
submission to the will of God, his praise, and his repentance, will be a 
model for the prayer of the people. His prayer, the prayer of God's 
Anointed, is a faithful adherence to the divine promise and expresses a 
loving and joyful trust in God, the only King and Lord.28 In the 
Psalms David, inspired by the Holy Spirit, is the first prophet of Jewish 
and Christian prayer. the prayer of Christ, the true Messiah and Son of 
David, will reveal and fulfill the meaning of this prayer. 

2580 The Temple of Jerusalem, the house of prayer that David wanted 
to build, will be the work of his son, Solomon. the prayer at the 
dedication of the Temple relies on God's promise and covenant, on the 
active presence of his name among his People, recalling his mighty 
deeds at the Exodus.29 The king lifts his hands toward heaven and 
begs the Lord, on his own behalf, on behalf of the entire people, and of 
the generations yet to come, for the forgiveness of their sins and for 
their daily needs, so that the nations may know that He is the only God 
and that the heart of his people may belong wholly and entirely to him. 

Elijah, the prophets and conversion of heart 

2581 For the People of God, the Temple was to be the place of their 
education in prayer: pilgrimages, feasts and sacrifices, the evening 
offering, the incense, and the bread of the Presence (“shewbread") - all 



these signs of the holiness and glory of God Most High and Most Near 
were appeals to and ways of prayer. But ritualism often encouraged an 
excessively external worship. the people needed education in faith and 
conversion of heart; this was the mission of the prophets, both before 
and after the Exile. 
 

2582 Elijah is the "father" of the prophets, "the generation of those 
who seek him, who seek the face of the God of Jacob."30 Elijah's name, 
"The Lord is my God," foretells the people's cry in response to his 
prayer on Mount Carmel.31 St. James refers to Elijah in order to 
encourage us to pray: "The prayer of the righteous is powerful and 
effective."32 

2583 After Elijah had learned mercy during his retreat at the Wadi 
Cherith, he teaches the widow of Zarephath to believe in the Word of 
God and confirms her faith by his urgent prayer: God brings the 
widow's child back to life.33 The sacrifice on Mount Carmel is a 
decisive test for the faith of the People of God. In response to Elijah's 
plea, "Answer me, O LORD, answer me," the Lord's fire consumes the 
holocaust, at the time of the evening oblation. the Eastern liturgies 
repeat Elijah's plea in the Eucharistic epiclesis.  

Finally, taking the desert road that leads to the place where the living 
and true God reveals himself to his people, Elijah, like Moses before 
him, hides "in a cleft of he rock" until the mysterious presence of God 
has passed by.34 But only on the mountain of the Transfiguration will 
Moses and Elijah behold the unveiled face of him whom they sought; 
"the light of the knowledge of the glory of God [shines] in the face of 
Christ," crucified and risen.35 

2584 In their "one to one" encounters with God, the prophets draw 
light and strength for their mission. Their prayer is not flight from this 
unfaithful world, but rather attentiveness to the Word of God. At times 
their prayer is an argument or a complaint, but it is always an 
intercession that awaits and prepares for the intervention of the Savior 
God, the Lord of history.36 

The Psalms, the prayer of the assembly 



2585 From the time of David to the coming of the Messiah texts 
appearing in these sacred books show a deepening in prayer for oneself 
and in prayer for others.37 Thus the psalms were gradually collected 
into the five books of the Psalter (or "Praises"), the masterwork of 
prayer in the Old Testament. 

2586 The Psalms both nourished and expressed the prayer of the 
People of God gathered during the great feasts at Jerusalem and each 
Sabbath in the synagogues. Their prayer is inseparably personal and 
communal; it concerns both those who are praying and all men. the 
Psalms arose from the communities of the Holy Land and the 
Diaspora, but embrace all creation. Their prayer recalls the saving 
events of the past, yet extends into the future, even to the end of 
history; it commemorates the promises God has already kept, and 
awaits the Messiah who will fulfill them definitively. Prayed by Christ 
and fulfilled in him, the Psalms remain essential to the prayer of the 
Church.38 

2587 The Psalter is the book in which the Word of God becomes man's 
prayer. In other books of the Old Testament, "the words proclaim 
[God's] works and bring to light the mystery they contain."39 The 
words of the Psalmist, sung for God, both express and acclaim the 
Lord's saving works; the same Spirit inspires both God's work and 
man's response. Christ will unite the two. In him, the psalms continue 
to teach us how to pray. 

2588 The Psalter's many forms of prayer take shape both in the liturgy 
of the Temple and in the human heart. Whether hymns or prayers of 
lamentation or thanksgiving, whether individual or communal, whether 
royal chants, songs of pilgrimage or wisdom meditations, the Psalms 
are a mirror of God's marvelous deeds in the history of his people, as 
well as reflections of the human experiences of the Psalmist. Though a 
given psalm may reflect an event of the past, it still possesses such 
direct simplicity that it can be prayed in truth by men of all times and 
conditions. 

2589 Certain constant characteristics appear throughout the Psalms: 
simplicity and spontaneity of prayer; the desire for God himself 
through and with all that is good in his creation; the distraught 
situation of the believer who, in his preferential love for the Lord, is 



exposed to a host of enemies and temptations, but who waits upon 
what the faithful God will do, in the certitude of his love and in 
submission to his will. the prayer of the psalms is always sustained by 
praise; that is why the title of this collection as handed down to us is so 
fitting: "The Praises." Collected for the assembly's worship, the Psalter 
both sounds the call to prayer and sings the response to that call: 
Hallelu-Yah! (“Alleluia"), "Praise the Lord!" 

What is more pleasing than a psalm? David expresses it well: "Praise 
the Lord, for a psalm is good: let there be praise of our God with 
gladness and grace!" Yes, a psalm is a blessing on the lips of the people, 
praise of God, the assembly's homage, a general acclamation, a word 
that speaks for all, the voice of the Church, a confession of faith in 
song.40

CHAPTER ONE THE REVELATION OF PRAYER - THE 
UNIVERSAL CALL TO PRAYER 

 

 

 

Article 1 IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

2590 "Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God or the 
requesting of good things from God" (St. John Damascene, Defide 
orth. 3, 24: PG 94, 1089C). 



2591 God tirelessly calls each person to this mysterious encounter with 
Himself. Prayer unfolds throughout the whole history of salvation as a 
reciprocal call between God and man. 

2592 The prayer of Abraham and Jacob is presented as a battle of faith 
marked by trust in God's faithfulness and by certitude in the victory 
promised to perseverance. 

2593 The prayer of Moses responds to the living God's initiative for the 
salvation of his people. It foreshadows the prayer of intercession of the 
unique mediator, Christ Jesus. 

2594 The prayer of the People of God flourished in the shadow of the 
dwelling place of God's presence on earth, the ark of the covenant and 
the Temple, under the guidance of their shepherds, especially King 
David, and of the prophets. 

2595 The prophets summoned the people to conversion of heart and, 
while zealously seeking the face of God, like Elijah, they interceded for 
the people. 

2596 The Psalms constitute the masterwork of prayer in the Old 
Testament. They present two inseparable qualities: the personal, and 
the communal. They extend to all dimensions of history, recalling 
God's promises already fulfilled and looking for the coming of the 
Messiah. 

2597 Prayed and fulfilled in Christ, the Psalms are an essential and 
permanent element of the prayer of the Church. They are suitable for 
men of every condition and time.

CHAPTER ONE THE REVELATION OF PRAYER - THE 
UNIVERSAL CALL TO PRAYER 

 

 

Article 2 IN THE FULLNESS OF TIME 

2598 The drama of prayer is fully revealed to us in the Word who 
became flesh and dwells among us. To seek to understand his prayer 
through what his witnesses proclaim to us in the Gospel is to approach 
the holy Lord Jesus as Moses approached the burning bush: first to 
contemplate him in prayer, then to hear how he teaches us to pray, in 
order to know how he hears our prayer. 

Jesus prays 

2599 The Son of God who became Son of the Virgin learned to pray 
according to his human heart. He learns the formulas of prayer from 
his mother, who kept in her heart and meditated upon all the "great 
things" done by  the Almighty.41 He learns to pray in the words and 
rhythms of the prayer of his people, in the synagogue at Nazareth and 
the Temple at Jerusalem. But his prayer springs from an otherwise 
secret source, as he intimates at the age of twelve: "I must be in my 



Father's house."42 Here the newness of prayer in the fullness of time 
begins to be revealed: his filial prayer, which the Father awaits from his 
children, is finally going to be lived out by the only Son in his 
humanity, with and for men. 

2600 The Gospel according to St. Luke emphasizes the action of the 
Holy Spirit and the meaning of prayer in Christ's ministry. Jesus prays 
before the decisive moments of his mission: before his Father's witness 
to him during his baptism and Transfiguration, and before his own 
fulfillment of the Father's plan of love by his Passion.43 He also prays 
before the decisive moments involving the mission of his apostles: at 
his election and call of the Twelve, before Peter's confession of him as 
"the Christ of God," and again that the faith of the chief of the 
Apostles may not fail when tempted.44 Jesus' prayer before the events 
of salvation that the Father has asked him to fulfill is a humble and 
trusting commitment of his human will to the loving will of the Father. 

2601 "He was praying in a certain place and when he had ceased, one 
of his disciples said to him, 'Lord, teach us to pray."'45 In seeing the 
Master at prayer the disciple of Christ also wants to pray. By 
contemplating and hearing the Son, the master of prayer, the children 
learn to pray to the Father. 

2602 Jesus often draws apart to pray in solitude, on a mountain, 
preferably at night.46 He includes all men in his prayer, for he has 
taken on humanity in his incarnation, and he offers them to the Father 
when he offers himself. Jesus, the Word who has become flesh, shares 
by his human prayer in all that "his brethren" experience; he 
sympathizes with their weaknesses in order to free them.47 It was for 
this that the Father sent him. His words and works are the visible 
manifestation of his prayer in secret. 
 

2603 The evangelists have preserved two more explicit prayers offered 
by Christ during his public ministry. Each begins with thanksgiving. In 
the first, Jesus confesses the Father, acknowledges, and blesses him 
because he has hidden the mysteries of the Kingdom from those who 
think themselves learned and has revealed them to infants, the poor of 
the Beatitudes.48 His exclamation, "Yes, Father!" expresses the depth 
of his heart, his adherence to the Father's "good pleasure," echoing his 



mother's Fiat at the time of his conception and prefiguring what he will 
say to the Father in his agony. the whole prayer of Jesus is contained in 
this loving adherence of his human heart to the mystery of the will of 
the Father.49 

2604 The second prayer, before the raising of Lazarus, is recorded by 
St. John.50 Thanksgiving precedes the event: "Father, I thank you for 
having heard me," which implies that the Father always hears his 
petitions. Jesus immediately adds: "I know that you always hear me," 
which implies that Jesus, on his part, constantly made such petitions. 
Jesus' prayer, characterized by thanksgiving, reveals to us how to ask: 
before the gift is given, Jesus commits himself to the One who in giving 
gives himself. the Giver is more precious than the gift; he is the 
"treasure"; in him abides his Son's heart; the gift is given "as well."51 

The priestly prayer of Jesus holds a unique place in the economy of 
salvation.52 A meditation on it will conclude Section One. It reveals 
the ever present prayer of our High Priest and, at the same time, 
contains what he teaches us about our prayer to our Father, which will 
be developed in Section Two. 

2605 When the hour had come for him to fulfill the Father's plan of 
love, Jesus allows a glimpse of the boundless depth of his filial prayer, 
not only before he freely delivered himself up (“Abba . . . not my will, 
but yours."),53 but even in his last words on the Cross, where prayer 
and the gift of self are but one: "Father, forgive them, for they know 
not what they do",54 "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in 
Paradise",55 "Woman, behold your son" - "Behold your mother",56 "I 
thirst.";57 "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?"58 "It is 
finished";59 "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!"60 until the 
"loud cry" as he expires, giving up his spirit.61 

2606 All the troubles, for all time, of humanity enslaved by sin and 
death, all the petitions and intercessions of salvation history are 
summed up in this cry of the incarnate Word. Here the Father accepts 
them and, beyond all hope, answers them by raising his Son. Thus is 
fulfilled and brought to completion the drama of prayer in the 
economy of creation and salvation. the Psalter gives us the key to 
prayer in Christ. In the "today" of the Resurrection the Father says: 
"You are my Son, today I have begotten you. Ask of me, and I will 



make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your 
possession."62 

The Letter to the Hebrews expresses in dramatic terms how the prayer 
of Jesus accomplished the victory of salvation: "In the days of his flesh, 
Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to 
him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard for his 
godly fear. Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what 
he suffered, and being made perfect, he became the source of eternal 
salvation to all who obey him."63 

  

Jesus teaches us how to pray 

2607 When Jesus prays he is already teaching us how to pray. His 
prayer to his Father is the theological path (the path of faith, hope, and 
charity) of our prayer to God. But the Gospel also gives us Jesus' 
explicit teaching on prayer. Like a wise teacher he takes hold of us 
where we are and leads us progressively toward the Father. Addressing 
the crowds following him, Jesus builds on what they already know of 
prayer from the Old Covenant and opens to them the newness of the 
coming Kingdom. Then he reveals this newness to them in parables. 
Finally, he will speak openly of the Father and the Holy Spirit to his 
disciples who will be the teachers of prayer in his Church. 

2608 From the Sermon on the Mount onwards, Jesus insists on 
conversion of heart: reconciliation with one's brother before presenting 
an offering on the altar, love of enemies, and prayer for persecutors, 
prayer to the Father in secret, not heaping up empty phrases, prayerful 
forgiveness from the depths of the heart, purity of heart, and seeking 
the Kingdom before all else.64 This filial conversion is entirely directed 
to the Father. 

2609 Once committed to conversion, the heart learns to pray in faith. 
Faith is a filial adherence to God beyond what we feel and understand. 
It is possible because the beloved Son gives us access to the Father. He 
can ask us to "seek" and to "knock," since he himself is the door and 
the way.65 



2610 Just as Jesus prays to the Father and gives thanks before receiving 
his gifts, so he teaches us filial boldness: "Whatever you ask in prayer, 
believe that you receive it, and you will."66 Such is the power of prayer 
and of faith that does not doubt: "all things are possible to him who 
believes."67 Jesus is as saddened by the "lack of faith" of his own 
neighbors and the "little faith" of his own disciples68 as he is struck 
with admiration at the great faith of the Roman centurion and the 
Canaanite woman.69 

2611 The prayer of faith consists not only in saying "Lord, Lord," but 
in disposing the heart to do the will of the Father.70 Jesus calls his 
disciples to bring into their prayer this concern for cooperating with 
the divine plan.71 

2612 In Jesus "the Kingdom of God is at hand."72 He calls his hearers 
to conversion and faith, but also to watchfulness. In prayer the disciple 
keeps watch, attentive to Him Who Is and Him Who Comes, in 
memory of his first coming in the lowliness of the flesh, and in the 
hope of his second coming in glory.73 In communion with their 
Master, the disciples' prayer is a battle; only by keeping watch in prayer 
can one avoid falling into temptation.74 

2613 Three principal parables on prayer are transmitted to us by St. 
Luke:  

- the first, "the importunate friend,"75 invites us to urgent prayer: 
"Knock, and it will be opened to you." To the one who prays like this, 
the heavenly Father will "give whatever he needs," and above all the 
Holy Spirit who contains all gifts.  

- the second, "the importunate widow,"76 is centered on one of the 
qualities of prayer: it is necessary to pray always without ceasing and 
with the patience of faith. "and yet, when the Son of Man comes, will 
he find faith on earth?"  

- the third parable, "the Pharisee and the tax collector,"77 concerns the 
humility of the heart that prays. "God, be merciful to me a sinner!" the 
Church continues to make this prayer its own: Kyrie eleison! 

2614 When Jesus openly entrusts to his disciples the mystery of prayer 
to the Father, he reveals to them what their prayer and ours must be, 



once he has returned to the Father in his glorified humanity. What is 
new is to "ask in his name."78 Faith in the Son introduces the disciples 
into the knowledge of the Father, because Jesus is "the way, and the 
truth, and the life."79 Faith bears its fruit in love: it means keeping the 
word and the commandments of Jesus, it means abiding with him in 
the Father who, in him, so loves us that he abides with us. In this new 
covenant the certitude that our petitions will be heard is founded on 
the prayer of Jesus.80 

2615 Even more, what the Father gives us when our prayer is united 
with that of Jesus is "another Counselor, to be with you for ever, even 
the Spirit of truth."81 This new dimension of prayer and of its 
circumstances is displayed throughout the farewell discourse.82 In the 
Holy Spirit, Christian prayer is a communion of love with the Father, 
not only through Christ but also in him: "Hitherto you have asked 
nothing in my name; ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be 
full."83 

Jesus hears our prayer 

2616 Prayer to Jesus is answered by him already during his ministry, 
through signs that anticipate the power of his death and Resurrection: 
Jesus hears the prayer of faith, expressed in words (the leper, Jairus, the 
Canaanite woman, the good thief)84 or in silence (the bearers of the 
paralytic, the woman with a hemorrhage who touches his clothes, the 
tears and ointment of the sinful woman).85 The urgent request of the 
blind men, "Have mercy on us, Son of David" or "Jesus, Son of David, 
have mercy on me!" has-been renewed in the traditional prayer to Jesus 
known as the Jesus Prayer: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy 
on me, a sinner!"86 Healing infirmities or forgiving sins, Jesus always 
responds to a prayer offered in faith: "Your faith has made you well; go 
in peace." 

St. Augustine wonderfully summarizes the three dimensions of Jesus' 
prayer: "He prays for us as our priest, prays in us as our Head, and is 
prayed to by us as our God. Therefore let us acknowledge our voice in 
him and his in us."87 

The prayer of the Virgin Mary 



2617 Mary's prayer is revealed to us at the dawning of the fullness of 
time. Before the incarnation of the Son of God, and before the 
outpouring of the Holy Spirit, her prayer cooperates in a unique way 
with the Father's plan of loving kindness: at the Annunciation, for 
Christ's conception; at Pentecost, for the formation of the Church, his 
Body.88 In the faith of his humble handmaid, the Gift of God found 
the acceptance he had awaited from the beginning of time. She whom 
the Almighty made "full of grace" responds by offering her whole 
being: "Behold I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be [done] to me 
according to your word." "Fiat": this is Christian prayer: to be wholly 
God's, because he is wholly ours. 

2618 The Gospel reveals to us how Mary prays and intercedes in faith. 
At Cana,89 The mother of Jesus asks her son for the needs of a 
wedding feast; this is the sign of another feast - that of the wedding of 
the Lamb where he gives his body and blood at the request of the 
Church, his Bride. It is at the hour of the New Covenant, at the foot of 
the cross,90 that Mary is heard as the Woman, the new Eve, the true 
"Mother of all the living." 

2619 That is why the Canticle of Mary,91 The Magnificat (Latin) or 
Megalynei (byzantine) is the song both of the Mother of God and of 
the Church; the song of the Daughter of Zion and of the new People of 
God; the song of thanksgiving for the fullness of graces poured out in 
the economy of salvation and the song of the "poor" whose hope is met 
by the fulfillment of the promises made to our ancestors, "to Abraham 
and to his posterity for ever."

Article 2 IN THE FULLNESS OF TIME 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

2620 Jesus' filial prayer is the perfect model of prayer in the New 
Testament. Often done in solitude and in secret, the prayer of Jesus 
involves a loving adherence to the will of the Father even to the Cross 
and an absolute confidence in being heard. 

2621 In his teaching, Jesus teaches his disciples to pray with a purified 
heart, with lively and persevering faith, with filial boldness. He calls 
them to vigilance and invites them to present their petitions to God in 
his name. Jesus Christ himself answers prayers addressed to him. 

2622 The prayers of the Virgin Mary, in her Fiat and Magnificat, are 
characterized by the generous offering of her whole being in faith.

Article 3 IN THE AGE OF THE CHURCH 

2623 On the day of Pentecost, the Spirit of the Promise was poured 
out on the disciples, gathered "together in one place."92 While awaiting 
the Spirit, "all these with one accord devoted themselves to prayer."93 
The Spirit who teaches the Church and recalls for her everything that 
Jesus said94 was also to form her in the life of prayer. 



2624 In the first community of Jerusalem, believers "devoted 
themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of 
bread, and the prayers."95 This sequence is characteristic of the 
Church's prayer: founded on the apostolic faith; authenticated by 
charity; nourished in the Eucharist. 

2625 In the first place these are prayers that the faithful hear and read 
in the Scriptures, but also that they make their own - especially those 
of the Psalms, in view of their fulfillment in Christ.96 The Holy Spirit, 
who thus keeps the memory of Christ alive in his Church at prayer, 
also leads her toward the fullness of truth and inspires new 
formulations expressing the unfathomable mystery of Christ at work in 
his Church's life, sacraments, and mission. These formulations are 
developed in the great liturgical and spiritual traditions. the forms of 
prayer revealed in the apostolic and canonical Scriptures remain 
normative for Christian prayer.

I. Blessing and Adoration 

2626 Blessing expresses the basic movement of Christian prayer: it is 
an encounter between God and man. In blessing, God's gift and man's 
acceptance of it are united in dialogue with each other. the prayer of 
blessing is man's response to God's gifts: because God blesses, the 
human heart can in return bless the One who is the source of every 
blessing. 

2627 TWO fundamental forms express this movement: our prayer 
ascends in the Holy Spirit through Christ to the Father - we bless him 
for having blessed us;97 it implores the grace of the Holy Spirit that 
descends through Christ from the Father - he blesses us.98 

2628 Adoration is the first attitude of man acknowledging that he is a 
creature before his Creator. It exalts the greatness of the Lord who 
made us99 and the almighty power of the Savior who sets us free from 
evil. Adoration is homage of the spirit to the "King of Glory,"100 
respectful silence in the presence of the "ever greater" God.101 
Adoration of the thrice-holy and sovereign God of love blends with 
humility and gives assurance to our supplications.

II. Prayer of Petition 

2629 The vocabulary of supplication in the New Testament is rich in 
shades of meaning: ask, beseech, plead, invoke, entreat, cry out, even 
"struggle in prayer."102 Its most usual form, because the most 
spontaneous, is petition: by prayer of petition we express awareness of 
our relationship with God. We are creatures who are not our own 
beginning, not the masters of adversity, not our own last end. We are 
sinners who as Christians know that we have turned away from our 
Father. Our petition is already a turning back to him. 

2630 The New Testament contains scarcely any prayers of lamentation, 
so frequent in the Old Testament. In the risen Christ the Church's 
petition is buoyed by hope, even if we still wait in a state of expectation 
and must be converted anew every day. Christian petition, what St. 
Paul calls {"groaning," arises from another depth, that of creation "in 
labor pains" and that of ourselves "as we wait for the redemption of our 
bodies.  

For in this hope we were saved."103 In the end, however, "with sighs 
too deep for words" the Holy Spirit "helps us in our weakness; for we 
do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes 
for us with sighs too deep for words."104 

2631 The first movement of the prayer of petition is asking forgiveness, 
like the tax collector in the parable: "God, be merciful to me a 
sinner!"105 It is a prerequisite for righteous and pure prayer. A trusting 
humility brings us back into the light of communion between the 
Father and his Son Jesus Christ and with one another, so that "we 
receive from him whatever we ask."106 Asking forgiveness is the 
prerequisite for both the Eucharistic liturgy and personal prayer. 



2632 Christian petition is centered on the desire and search for the 
Kingdom to come, in keeping with the teaching of Christ.107 There is 
a hierarchy in these petitions: we pray first for the Kingdom, then for 
what is necessary to welcome it and cooperate with its coming. This 
collaboration with the mission of Christ and the Holy Spirit, which is 
now that of the Church, is the object of the prayer of the apostolic 
community.108 It is the prayer of Paul, the apostle par excellence, 
which reveals to us how the divine solicitude for all the churches ought 
to inspire Christian prayer.109 By prayer every baptized person works 
for the coming of the Kingdom. 

2633 When we share in God's saving love, we understand that every 
need can become the object of petition. Christ, who assumed all things 
in order to redeem all things, is glorified by what we ask the Father in 
his name.110 It is with this confidence that St. James and St. Paul 
exhort us to pray at all times.111

III. Prayer of Intercession 

2634 Intercession is a prayer of petition which leads us to pray as Jesus 
did. He is the one intercessor with the Father on behalf of all men, 
especially sinners.112 He is "able for all time to save those who draw 
near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for 
them."113 The Holy Spirit "himself intercedes for us . . . and 
intercedes for the saints according to the will of God."114 

2635 Since Abraham, intercession - asking on behalf of another has 
been characteristic of a heart attuned to God's mercy. In the age of the 
Church, Christian intercession participates in Christ's, as an expression 
of the communion of saints. In intercession, he who prays looks "not 
only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others," even to 
the point of praying for those who do him harm.115 

2636 The first Christian communities lived this form of fellowship 
intensely.116 Thus the Apostle Paul gives them a share in his ministry 
of preaching the Gospel117 but also intercedes for them.118 The 



intercession of Christians recognizes no boundaries: "for all men, for 
kings and all who are in high positions," for persecutors, for the 
salvation of those who reject the Gospel.119

IV. Prayer of Thanksgiving 

2637 Thanksgiving characterizes the prayer of the Church which, in 
celebrating the Eucharist, reveals and becomes more fully what she is. 
Indeed, in the work of salvation, Christ sets creation free from sin and 
death to consecrate it anew and make it return to the Father, for his 
glory. the thanksgiving of the members of the Body participates in that 
of their Head. 

2638 As in the prayer of petition, every event and need can become an 
offering of thanksgiving. the letters of St. Paul often begin and end 
with thanksgiving, and the Lord Jesus is always present in it: "Give 
thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus 
for you"; "Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with 
thanksgiving."120

V. Prayer of Praise 

2639 Praise is the form of prayer which recognizes most immediately 
that God is God. It lauds God for his own sake and gives him glory, 
quite beyond what he does, but simply because HE IS. It shares in the 
blessed happiness of the pure of heart who love God in faith before 
seeing him in glory. By praise, the Spirit is joined to our spirits to bear 
witness that we are children of God,121 testifying to the only Son in 
whom we are adopted and by whom we glorify the Father. Praise 
embraces the other forms of prayer and carries them toward him who 
is its source and goal: the "one God, the Father, from whom are all 
things and for whom we exist."122 

2640 St. Luke in his gospel often expresses wonder and praise at the 
marvels of Christ and in his Acts of the Apostles stresses them as 
actions of the Holy Spirit: the community of Jerusalem, the invalid 



healed by Peter and John, the crowd that gives glory to God for that, 
and the pagans of Pisidia who "were glad and glorified the word of 
God."123 

2641 "[Address] one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, 
singing and making melody to the Lord with all your heart."124 Like 
the inspired writers of the New Testament, the first Christian 
communities read the Book of Psalms in a new way, singing in it the 
mystery of Christ. In the newness of the Spirit, they also composed 
hymns and canticles in the light of the unheard - of event that God 
accomplished in his Son: his Incarnation, his death which conquered 
death, his Resurrection, and Ascension to the right hand of the 
Father.125 Doxology, the praise of God, arises from this "marvelous 
work" of the whole economy of salvation.126 

2642 The Revelation of "what must soon take place," the Apocalypse, 
is borne along by the songs of the heavenly liturgy127 but also by the 
intercession of the "witnesses" (martyrs).128 The prophets and the 
saints, all those who were slain on earth for their witness to Jesus, the 
vast throng of those who, having come through the great tribulation, 
have gone before us into the Kingdom, all sing the praise and glory of 
him who sits on the throne, and of the Lamb.129 In communion with 
them, the Church on earth also sings these songs with faith in the 
midst of trial. By means of petition and intercession, faith hopes 
against all hope and gives thanks to the "Father of lights," from whom 
"every perfect gift" comes down.130 Thus faith is pure praise. 

2643 The Eucharist contains and expresses all forms of prayer: it is 
"the pure offering" of the whole Body of Christ to the glory of God's 
name131 and, according to the traditions of East and West, it is the 
"sacrifice of praise."

Article 3 IN THE AGE OF THE CHURCH 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

2644 The Holy Spirit who teaches the Church and recalls to her all 
that Jesus said also instructs her in the life of prayer, inspiring new 
expressions of the same basic forms of rayer: blessing, petition, 
intercession, thanksgiving, and praise. 

2645 Because God blesses the human heart, it can in return bless him 
who is the source of every blessing. 

2646 Forgiveness, the quest for the Kingdom, and every true need are 
objects of the prayer of petition. 

2647 Prayer of intercession consists in asking on behalf of another. It 
knows no boundaries and extends to one's enemies. 

2648 Every joy and suffering, every event and need can become the 
matter for thanksgiving which, sharing in that of Christ, should fill 
one's whole life: "Give thanks in all circumstances" (1 Thess 5:18). 

2649 Prayer of praise is entirely disinterested and rises to God, lauds 
him, and gives him glory for his own sake, quite beyond what he has 
done, but simply because HE IS.

CHAPTER TWO THE TRADITION OF PRAYER 

2650 Prayer cannot be reduced to the spontaneous outpouring of 
interior impulse: in order to pray, one must have the will to pray. Nor is 
it enough to know what the Scriptures reveal about prayer: one must 
also learn how to pray. Through a living transmission (Sacred 
Tradition) within "the believing and praying Church,"1 The Holy 
Spirit teaches the children of God how to pray. 

2651 The tradition of Christian prayer is one of the ways in which the 
tradition of faith takes shape and grows, especially through the 
contemplation and study of believers who treasure in their hearts the 
events and words of the economy of salvation, and through their 
profound grasp of the spiritual realities they experience.2

CHAPTER TWO THE TRADITION OF PRAYER 

 

 

Article 1 AT THE WELLSPRINGS OF PRAYER 

2652 The Holy Spirit is the living water "welling up to eternal life"3 in 
the heart that prays. It is he who teaches us to accept it at its source: 
Christ. Indeed in the Christian life there are several wellsprings where 
Christ awaits us to enable us to drink of the Holy Spirit. 

The Word of God 



2653 The Church "forcefully and specially exhorts all the Christian 
faithful . . . to learn 'the surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ' (? Phil 
3:8) by frequent reading of the divine Scriptures.... Let them 
remember, however, that prayer should accompany the reading of 
Sacred Scripture, so that a dialogue takes place between God and man. 
For 'we speak to him when we pray; we listen to him when we read the 
divine oracles."'4 

2654 The spiritual writers, paraphrasing Matthew 7:7, summarize in 
this way the dispositions of the heart nourished by the word of God in 
prayer "Seek in reading and you will find in meditating; knock in 
mental prayer and it will be opened to you by contemplation."5 

The Liturgy of the Church 

2655 In the sacramental liturgy of the Church, the mission of Christ 
and of the Holy Spirit proclaims, makes present, and communicates 
the mystery of salvation, which is continued in the heart that prays. the 
spiritual writers sometimes compare the heart to an altar. Prayer 
internalizes and assimilates the liturgy during and after its celebration. 
Even when it is lived out "in secret,"6 prayer is always prayer of the 
Church; it is a communion with the Holy Trinity.7 

The theological virtues 

2656 One enters into prayer as one enters into liturgy: by the narrow 
gate of faith. Through the signs of his presence, it is the Face of the 
Lord that we seek and desire; it is his Word that we want to hear and 
keep. 

2657 The Holy Spirit, who instructs us to celebrate the liturgy in 
expectation of Christ's return, teaches us - to pray in hope. Conversely, 
the prayer of the Church and personal prayer nourish hope in us. the 
psalms especially, with their concrete and varied language, teach us to 
fix our hope in God: "I waited patiently for the LORD; he inclined to 
me and heard my cry."8 As St. Paul prayed: "May the God of hope fill 
you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the 
Holy Spirit you may abound in hope."9 

2658 "Hope does not disappoint us, because God's love has been 
poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit who has been given to us."10 



Prayer, formed by the liturgical life, draws everything into the love by 
which we are loved in Christ and which enables us to respond to him 
by loving as he has loved us. Love is the source of prayer; whoever 
draws from it reaches the summit of prayer. In the words of the Cure 
of Ars: 

I love you, O my God, and my only desire is to love you until the last 
breath of my life. I love you, O my infinitely lovable God, and I would 
rather die loving you, than live without loving you. I love you, Lord, 
and the only grace I ask is to love you eternally.... My God, if my 
tongue cannot say in every moment that I love you, I want my heart to 
repeat it to you as often as I draw breath.11 

"Today" 

2659 We learn to pray at certain moments by hearing the Word of the 
Lord and sharing in his Paschal mystery, but his Spirit is offered us at 
all times, in the events of each day, to make prayer spring up from us. 
Jesus' teaching about praying to our Father is in the same vein as his 
teaching about providence:12 time is in the Father's hands; it is in the 
present that we encounter him, not yesterday nor tomorrow, but today: 
"O that today you would hearken to his voice! Harden not your 
hearts."13 

2660 Prayer in the events of each day and each moment is one of the 
secrets of the kingdom revealed to "little children," to the servants of 
Christ, to the poor of the Beatitudes. It is right and good to pray so 
that the coming of the kingdom of justice and peace may influence the 
march of history, but it is just as important to bring the help of prayer 
into humble, everyday situations; all forms of prayer can be the leaven 
to which the Lord compares the kingdom.14

IN BRIEF 

2661 By a living transmission -Tradition - the Holy Spirit in the 
Church teaches the children of God to pray. 

2662 The Word of God, the liturgy of the Church, and the virtues of 
faith, hope, and charity are sources of prayer.

CHAPTER TWO THE TRADITION OF PRAYER 

 

 

Article 2 THE WAY OF PRAYER 

2663 In the living tradition of prayer, each Church proposes to its 
faithful, according to its historic, social, and cultural context, a 
language for prayer: words, melodies, gestures, iconography. the 
Magisterium of the Church15 has the task of discerning the fidelity of 
these ways of praying to the tradition of apostolic faith; it is for pastors 
and catechists to explain their meaning, always in relation to Jesus 
Christ. 

Prayer to the Father 

2664 There is no other way of Christian prayer than Christ. Whether 
our prayer is communal or personal, vocal or interior, it has access to 
the Father only if we pray "in the name" of Jesus. the sacred humanity 
of Jesus is therefore the way by which the Holy Spirit teaches us to 
pray to God our Father. 

Prayer to Jesus 

2665 The prayer of the Church, nourished by the Word of God and the 
celebration of the liturgy, teaches us to pray to the Lord Jesus. Even 
though her prayer is addressed above all to the Father, it includes in all 
the liturgical traditions forms of prayer addressed to Christ. Certain 
psalms, given their use in the Prayer of the Church, and the New 
Testament place on our lips and engrave in our hearts prayer to Christ 
in the form of invocations: Son of God, Word of God, Lord, Savior, 
Lamb of God, King, Beloved Son, Son of the Virgin, Good Shepherd, 
our Life, our Light, our Hope, our Resurrection, Friend of mankind.... 

2666 But the one name that contains everything is the one that the 
Son of God received in his incarnation: JESUS. the divine name may 
not be spoken by human lips, but by assuming our humanity the Word 
of God hands it over to us and we can invoke it: "Jesus," "YHWH 



saves."16 The name "Jesus" contains all: God and man and the whole 
economy of creation and salvation. To pray "Jesus" is to invoke him and 
to call him within us. His name is the only one that contains the 
presence it signifies. Jesus is the Risen One, and whoever invokes the 
name of Jesus is welcoming the Son of God who loved him and who 
gave himself up for him.17 

2667 This simple invocation of faith developed in the tradition of 
prayer under many forms in East and West. the most usual 
formulation, transmitted by the spiritual writers of the Sinai, Syria, and 
Mt. Athos, is the invocation, "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have 
mercy on us sinners." It combines the Christological hymn of 
Philippians 2:6-11 with the cry of the publican and the blind men 
begging for light.18 By it the heart is opened to human wretchedness 
and the Savior's mercy. 

2668 The invocation of the holy name of Jesus is the simplest way of 
praying always. When the holy name is repeated often by a humbly 
attentive heart, the prayer is not lost by heaping up empty phrases,19 
but holds fast to the word and "brings forth fruit with patience."20 
This prayer is possible "at all times" because it is not one occupation 
among others but the only occupation: that of loving God, which 
animates and transfigures every action in Christ Jesus. 

2669 The prayer of the Church venerates and honors the Heart of 
Jesus just as it invokes his most holy name. It adores the incarnate 
Word and his Heart which, out of love for men, he allowed to be 
pierced by our sins. Christian prayer loves to follow the way of the 
cross in the Savior's steps. the stations from the Praetorium to 
Golgotha and the tomb trace the way of Jesus, who by his holy Cross 
has redeemed the world. 

"Come, Holy Spirit" 

2670 "No one can say 'Jesus is Lord' except by the Holy Spirit."21 
Every time we begin to pray to Jesus it is the Holy Spirit who draws us 
on the way of prayer by his prevenient grace. Since he teaches us to 
pray by recalling Christ, how could we not pray to the Spirit too? That 
is why the Church invites us to call upon the Holy Spirit every day, 
especially at the beginning and the end of every important action. 



If the Spirit should not be worshiped, how can he divinize me through 
Baptism? If he should be worshiped, should he not be the object of 
adoration?22 

2671 The traditional form of petition to the Holy Spirit is to invoke the 
Father through Christ our Lord to give us the Consoler Spirit.23 Jesus 
insists on this petition to be made in his name at the very moment 
when he promises the gift of the Spirit of Truth.24 But the simplest 
and most direct prayer is also traditional, "Come, Holy Spirit," and 
every liturgical tradition has developed it in antiphons and hymns. 

Come, Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful and enkindle in them 
the fire of your love.25  

Heavenly King, Consoler Spirit, Spirit of Truth, present everywhere 
and filling all things, treasure of all good and source of all life, come 
dwell in us, cleanse and save us, you who are All Good.26 

2672 The Holy Spirit, whose anointing permeates our whole being, is 
the interior Master of Christian prayer. He is the artisan of the living 
tradition of prayer. To be sure, there are as many paths of prayer as 
there are persons who pray, but it is the same Spirit acting in all and 
with all. It is in the communion of the Holy Spirit that Christian prayer 
is prayer in the Church. 

In communion with the holy Mother of God 

2673 In prayer the Holy Spirit unites us to the person of the only Son, 
in his glorified humanity, through which and in which our filial prayer 
unites us in the Church with the Mother of Jesus.27 

2674 Mary gave her consent in faith at the Annunciation and 
maintained it without hesitation at the foot of the Cross. Ever since, 
her motherhood has extended to the brothers and sisters of her Son 
"who still journey on earth surrounded by dangers and difficulties."28 
Jesus, the only mediator, is the way of our prayer; Mary, his mother 
and ours, is wholly transparent to him: she "shows the way" 
(hodigitria), and is herself "the Sign" of the way, according to the 
traditional iconography of East and West. 

2675 Beginning with Mary's unique cooperation with the working of 
the Holy Spirit, the Churches developed their prayer to the holy 



Mother of God, centering it on the person of Christ manifested in his 
mysteries. In countless hymns and antiphons expressing this prayer, 
two movements usually alternate with one another: the first 
"magnifies" the Lord for the "great things" he did for his lowly servant 
and through her for all human beings29 The second entrusts the 
supplications and praises of the children of God to the Mother of 
Jesus, because she now knows the humanity which, in her, the Son of 
God espoused. 

2676 This twofold movement of prayer to Mary has found a privileged 
expression in the Ave Maria:  

Hail Mary [or Rejoice, Mary]: the greeting of the angel Gabriel opens 
this prayer. It is God himself who, through his angel as intermediary, 
greets Mary. Our prayer dares to take up this greeting to Mary with the 
regard God had for the lowliness of his humble servant and to exult in 
the joy he finds in her.30  

Full of grace, the Lord is with thee: These two phrases of the angel's 
greeting shed light on one another. Mary is full of grace because the 
Lord is with her. the grace with which she is filled is the presence of 
him who is the source of all grace. "Rejoice . . . O Daughter of 
Jerusalem . . . the Lord your God is in your midst."31 Mary, in whom 
the Lord himself has just made his dwelling, is the daughter of Zion in 
person, the ark of the covenant, the place where the glory of the Lord 
dwells. She is "the dwelling of God . . . with men."32 Full of grace, 
Mary is wholly given over to him who has come to dwell in her and 
whom she is about to give to the world.  

Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, 
Jesus. After the angel's greeting, we make Elizabeth's greeting our own. 
"Filled with the Holy Spirit," Elizabeth is the first in the long 
succession of generations who have called Mary "blessed."33 "Blessed 
is she who believed...."34 Mary is "blessed among women" because she 
believed in the fulfillment of the Lord's word. Abraham. because of his 
faith, became a blessing for all the nations of the earth.35 Mary, 
because of her faith, became the mother of believers, through whom all 
nations of the earth receive him who is God's own blessing: Jesus, the 
"fruit of thy womb." 



2677 Holy Mary, Mother of God: With Elizabeth we marvel, "and why 
is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"36 
Because she gives us Jesus, her son, Mary is Mother of God and our 
mother; we can entrust all our cares and petitions to her: she prays for 
us as she prayed for herself: "Let it be to me according to your 
word."37 By entrusting ourselves to her prayer, we abandon ourselves 
to the will of God together with her: "Thy will be done."  

Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death: By asking Mary 
to pray for us, we acknowledge ourselves to be poor sinners and we 
address ourselves to the "Mother of Mercy," the All-Holy One. We give 
ourselves over to her now, in the Today of our lives. and our trust 
broadens further, already at the present moment, to surrender "the 
hour of our death" wholly to her care. May she be there as she was at 
her son's death on the cross. May she welcome us as our mother at the 
hour of our passing38 to lead us to her son, Jesus, in paradise. 

2678 Medieval piety in the West developed the prayer of the rosary as a 
popular substitute for the Liturgy of the Hours. In the East, the litany 
called the Akathistos and the Paraclesis remained closer to the choral 
office in the Byzantine churches, while the Armenian, Coptic, and 
Syriac traditions preferred popular hymns and songs to the Mother of 
God. But in the Ave Maria, the theotokia, the hymns of St. Ephrem or 
St. Gregory of Narek, the tradition of prayer is basically the same. 

2679 Mary is the perfect Orans (prayer), a figure of the Church. When 
we pray to her, we are adhering with her to the plan of the Father, who 
sends his Son to save all men. Like the beloved disciple we welcome 
Jesus' mother into our homes,39 for she has become the mother of all 
the living. We can pray with and to her. the prayer of the Church is 
sustained by the prayer of Mary and united with it in hope.40

Article 2 THE WAY OF PRAYER 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

2680 Prayer is primarily addressed to the Father; it can also be 
directed toward Jesus, particularly by the invocation of his holy name: 
"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us sinners." 



2681 "No one can say 'Jesus is Lord', except by the Holy Spirit" (1 Cor 
12:3). the Church invites us to invoke the Holy Spirit as the interior 
Teacher of Christian prayer. 

2682 Because of Mary's singular cooperation with the action of the 
Holy Spirit, the Church loves to pray in communion with the Virgin 
Mary, to magnify with her the great things the Lord has done for her, 
and to entrust supplications and praises to her.

Article 3 GUIDES FOR PRAYER 

A cloud of witnesses 

2683 The witnesses who have preceded us into the kingdom,41 
especially those whom the Church recognizes as saints, share in the 
living tradition of prayer by the example of their lives, the transmission 
of their writings, and their prayer today. They contemplate God, praise 
him and constantly care for those whom they have left on earth. When 
they entered into the joy of their Master, they were "put in charge of 
many things."42 Their intercession is their most exalted service to 
God's plan. We can and should ask them to intercede for us and for the 
whole world. 

2684 In the communion of saints, many and varied spiritualities have 
been developed throughout the history of the churches. the personal 
charism of some witnesses to God's love for men has been handed on, 
like "the spirit" of Elijah to Elisha and John the Baptist, so that their 
followers may have a share in this spirit.43 A distinct spirituality can 
also arise at the point of convergence of liturgical and theological 
currents, bearing witness to the integration of the faith into a particular 
human environment and its history. the different schools of Christian 
spirituality share in the living tradition of prayer and are essential 
guides for the faithful. In their rich diversity they are refractions of the 
one pure light of the Holy Spirit. 

The Spirit is truly the dwelling of the saints and the saints are for the 
Spirit a place where he dwells as in his own home since they offer 
themselves as a dwelling place for God and are called his temple.44 

Servants of prayer 

2685 The Christian family is the first place of education in prayer. 
Based on the sacrament of marriage, the family is the "domestic 
church" where God's children learn to pray "as the Church" and to 
persevere in prayer. For young children in particular, daily family 
prayer is the first witness of the Church's living memory as awakened 
patiently by the Holy Spirit. 



2686 Ordained ministers are also responsible for the formation in 
prayer of their brothers and sisters in Christ. Servants of the Good 
Shepherd, they are ordained to lead the People of God to the living 
waters of prayer: the Word of God, the liturgy, the theological life (the 
life of faith, hope, and charity), and the Today of God in concrete 
situations.45 

2687 Many religious have consecrated their whole lives to prayer. 
Hermits, monks, and nuns since the time of the desert fathers have 
devoted their time to praising God and interceding for his people. the 
consecrated life cannot be sustained or spread without prayer; it is one 
of the living sources of contemplation and the spiritual life of the 
Church. 

2688 The catechesis of children, young people, and adults aims at 
teaching them to meditate on the Word of God in personal prayer, 
practicing it in liturgical prayer, and internalizing it at all times in order 
to bear fruit in a new life. Catechesis is also a time for the discernment 
and education of popular piety.46 The memorization of basic prayers 
offers an essential support to the life of prayer, but it is important to 
help learners savor their meaning. 

2689 Prayer groups, indeed "schools of prayer," are today one of the 
signs and one of the driving forces of renewal of prayer in the Church, 
provided they drink from authentic wellsprings of Christian prayer. 
Concern for ecclesial communion is a sign of true prayer in the 
Church. 

2690 The Holy Spirit gives to certain of the faithful the gifts of 
wisdom, faith and discernment for the sake of this common good 
which is prayer (spiritual direction). Men and women so endowed are 
true servants of the living tradition of prayer. 

According to St. John of the Cross, the person wishing to advance 
toward perfection should "take care into whose hands he entrusts 
himself, for as the master is, so will the disciple be, and as the father is 
so will be the son." and further: "In addition to being learned and 
discreet a director should be experienced.... If the spiritual director has 
no experience of the spiritual life, he will be incapable of leading into it 



the souls whom God is calling to it, and he will not even understand 
them."47 

Places favorable for prayer 

2691 The church, the house of God, is the proper place for the 
liturgical prayer of the parish community. It is also the privileged place 
for adoration of the real presence of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament. 
the choice of a favorable place is not a matter of indifference for true 
prayer.  

- For personal prayer, this can be a "prayer corner" with the Sacred 
Scriptures and icons, in order to be there, in secret, before our 
Father.48 In a Christian family, this kind of little oratory fosters prayer 
in common.  

- In regions where monasteries exist, the vocation of these 
communities is to further the participation of the faithful in the Liturgy 
of the Hours and to provide necessary solitude for more intense 
personal prayer.49  

- Pilgrimages evoke our earthly journey toward heaven and are 
traditionally very special occasions for renewal in prayer. For pilgrims 
seeking living water, shrines are special places for living the forms of 
Christian prayer "in Church."

IN BRIEF 

2692 In prayer, the pilgrim Church is associated with that of the saints, 
whose intercession she asks. 

2693 The different schools of Christian spirituality share in the living 
tradition of prayer and are precious guides for the spiritual life. 

2694 The Christian family is the first place for education in prayer. 



2695 Ordained ministers, the consecrated life, catechesis, prayer 
groups, and "spiritual direction" ensure assistance within the Church 
in the practice of prayer. 

2696 The most appropriate places for prayer are personal or family 
oratories, monasteries, places of pilgrimage, and above all the church, 
which is the proper place for liturgical prayer for the parish community 
and the privileged place for Eucharistic adoration.

CHAPTER THREE THE LIFE OF PRAYER 

2697 Prayer is the life of the new heart. It ought to animate us at every 
moment. But we tend to forget him who is our life and our all. This is 
why the Fathers of the spiritual life in the Deuteronomic and prophetic 



traditions insist that prayer is a remembrance of God often awakened 
by the memory of the heart "We must remember God more often than 
we draw breath."1 But we cannot pray "at all times" if we do not pray 
at specific times, consciously willing it These are the special times of 
Christian prayer, both in intensity and duration. 

2698 The Tradition of the Church proposes to the faithful certain 
rhythms of praying intended to nourish continual prayer. Some are 
daily, such as morning and evening prayer, grace before and after 
meals, the Liturgy of the Hours. Sundays, centered on the Eucharist, 
are kept holy primarily by prayer. the cycle of the liturgical year and its 
great feasts are also basic rhythms of the Christian's life of prayer. 

2699 The Lord leads all persons by paths and in ways pleasing to him, 
and each believer responds according to his heart's resolve and the 
personal expressions of his prayer. However, Christian Tradition has 
retained three major expressions of prayer: vocal meditative, and 
contemplative. They have one basic trait in common: composure of 
heart. This vigilance in keeping the Word and dwelling in the presence 
of God makes these three expressions intense times in the life of 
prayer.

Article 1 EXPRESSIONS OF PRAYER 

I. Vocal prayer 

2700 Through his Word, God speaks to man. By words, mental or 
vocal, our prayer takes flesh. Yet it is most important that the heart 
should be present to him to whom we are speaking in prayer: "Whether 
or not our prayer is heard depends not on the number of words, but on 
the fervor of our souls."2 

2701 Vocal prayer is an essential element of the Christian life. To his 
disciples, drawn by their Master's silent prayer, Jesus teaches a vocal 
prayer, the Our Father. He not only prayed aloud the liturgical prayers 
of the synagogue but, as the Gospels show, he raised his voice to 
express his personal prayer, from exultant blessing of the Father to the 
agony of Gesthemani.3 

2702 The need to involve the senses in interior prayer corresponds to a 
requirement of our human nature. We are body and spirit, and we 
experience the need to translate our feelings externally. We must pray 
with our whole being to give all power possible to our supplication. 



2703 This need also corresponds to a divine requirement. God seeks 
worshippers in Spirit and in Truth, and consequently living prayer that 
rises from the depths of the soul. He also wants the external expression 
that associates the body with interior prayer, for it renders him that 
perfect homage which is his due. 

2704 Because it is external and so thoroughly human, vocal prayer is 
the form of prayer most readily accessible to groups. Even interior 
prayer, however, cannot neglect vocal prayer. Prayer is internalized to 
the extent that we become aware of him "to whom we speak;"4 Thus 
vocal prayer becomes an initial form of contemplative prayer.

II. Meditation 

2705 Meditation is above all a quest. the mind seeks to understand the 
why and how of the Christian life, in order to adhere and respond to 
what the Lord is asking. the required attentiveness is difficult to 
sustain. We are usually helped by books, and Christians do not want for 
them: the Sacred Scriptures, particularly the Gospels, holy icons, 
liturgical texts of the day or season, writings of the spiritual fathers, 
works of spirituality, the great book of creation, and that of history the 
page on which the "today" of God is written. 



2706 To meditate on what we read helps us to make it our own by 
confronting it with ourselves. Here, another book is opened: the book 
of life. We pass from thoughts to reality. To the extent that we are 
humble and faithful, we discover in meditation the movements that stir 
the heart and we are able to discern them. It is a question of acting 
truthfully in order to come into the light: "Lord, what do you want me 
to do?" 

2707 There are as many and varied methods of meditation as there are 
spiritual masters. Christians owe it to themselves to develop the desire 
to meditate regularly, lest they come to resemble the three first kinds of 
soil in the parable of the sower.5 But a method is only a guide; the 
important thing is to advance, with the Holy Spirit, along the one way 
of prayer: Christ Jesus. 

2708 Meditation engages thought, imagination, emotion, and desire. 
This mobilization of faculties is necessary in order to deepen our 
convictions of faith, prompt the conversion of our heart, and 
strengthen our will to follow Christ. Christian prayer tries above all to 
meditate on the mysteries of Christ, as in lectio divina or the rosary. 
This form of prayerful reflection is of great value, but Christian prayer 
should go further: to the knowledge of the love of the Lord Jesus, to 
union with him.

III. Contemplative Prayer 

2709 What is contemplative prayer? St. Teresa answers: "Contemplative 
prayer [oracion mental] in my opinion is nothing else than a close 
sharing between friends; it means taking time frequently to be alone 
with him who we know loves us."6  

Contemplative prayer seeks him "whom my soul loves."7 It is Jesus, 
and in him, the Father. We seek him, because to desire him is always 
the beginning of love, and we seek him in that pure faith which causes 
us to be born of him and to live in him. In this inner prayer we can still 
meditate, but our attention is fixed on the Lord himself. 



2710 The choice of the time and duration of the prayer arises from a 
determined will, revealing the secrets of the heart. One does not 
undertake contemplative prayer only when one has the time: one 
makes time for the Lord, with the firm determination not to give up, 
no matter what trials and dryness one may encounter. One cannot 
always meditate, but one can always enter into inner prayer, 
independently of the conditions of health, work, or emotional state. the 
heart is the place of this quest and encounter, in poverty ant in faith. 

2711 Entering into contemplative prayer is like entering into the 
Eucharistic liturgy: we "gather up:" the heart, recollect our whole being 
under the prompting of the Holy Spirit, abide in the dwelling place of 
the Lord which we are, awaken our faith in order to enter into the 
presence of him who awaits us. We let our masks fall and turn our 
hearts back to the Lord who loves us, so as to hand ourselves over to 
him as an offering to be purified and transformed. 

2712 Contemplative prayer is the prayer of the child of God, of the 
forgiven sinner who agrees to welcome the love by which he is loved 
and who wants to respond to it by loving even more.8 But he knows 
that the love he is returning is poured out by the Spirit in his heart, for 
everything is grace from God. Contemplative prayer is the poor and 
humble surrender to the loving will of the Father in ever deeper union 
with his beloved Son. 

2713 Contemplative prayer is the simplest expression of the mystery of 
prayer. It is a gift, a grace; it can be accepted only in humility and 
poverty. Contemplative prayer is a covenant relationship established by 
God within our hearts.9 Contemplative prayer is a communion in 
which the Holy Trinity conforms man, the image of God, "to his 
likeness." 

2714 Contemplative prayer is also the pre-eminently intense time of 
prayer. In it the Father strengthens our inner being with power through 
his Spirit "that Christ may dwell in (our) hearts through faith" and we 
may be "grounded in love."10 

2715 Contemplation is a gaze of faith, fixed on Jesus. "I look at him 
and he looks at me": this is what a certain peasant of Ars in the time of 
his holy curé used to say while praying before the tabernacle. This 



focus on Jesus is a renunciation of self. His gaze purifies our heart; the 
light of the countenance of Jesus illumines the eyes of our heart and 
teaches us to see everything in the light of his truth and his compassion 
for all men. Contemplation also turns its gaze on the mysteries of the 
life of Christ. Thus it learns the "interior knowledge of our Lord," the 
more to love him and follow him.11 

2716 Contemplative prayer is hearing the Word of God. Far from being 
passive, such attentiveness is the obedience of faith, the unconditional 
acceptance of a servant, and the loving commitment of a child. It 
participates in the "Yes" of the Son become servant and the Fiat of 
God's lowly handmaid. 

2717 Contemplative prayer is silence, the "symbol of the world to 
come"12 or "silent love."13 Words in this kind of prayer are not 
speeches; they are like kindling that feeds the fire of love. In this 
silence, unbearable to the "outer" man, the Father speaks to us his 
incarnate Word, who suffered, died, and rose; in this silence the Spirit 
of adoption enables us to share in the prayer of Jesus. 

2718 Contemplative prayer is a union with the prayer of Christ insofar 
as it makes us participate in his mystery. the mystery of Christ is 
celebrated by the Church in the Eucharist, and the Holy Spirit makes 
it come alive in contemplative prayer so that our charity will manifest it 
in our acts. 

2719 Contemplative prayer is a communion of love bearing Life for 
the multitude, to the extent that it consents to abide in the night of 
faith. the Paschal night of the Resurrection passes through the night of 
the agony and the tomb - the three intense moments of the Hour of 
Jesus which his Spirit (and not "the flesh [which] is weak") brings to 
life in prayer. We must be willing to "keep watch with (him) one 
hour."14

IN BRIEF 

2720 The Church invites the faithful to regular prayer: daily prayers, 
the Liturgy of the Hours, Sunday Eucharist, the feasts of the liturgical 
year. 

2721 The Christian tradition comprises three major expressions of the 
life of prayer: vocal prayer, meditation, and contemplative prayer. They 
have in common the recollection of the heart. 

2722 Vocal prayer, founded on the union of body and soul in human 
nature, associates the body with the interior prayer of the heart, 
following Christ's example of praying to his Father and teaching the 
Our Father to his disciples. 

2723 Meditation is a prayerful quest engaging thought, imagination, 
emotion, and desire. Its goal is to make our own in faith the subject 
considered, by confronting it with the reality of our own life. 

2724 Contemplative prayer is the simple expression of the mystery of 
prayer. It is a gaze of faith fixed on Jesus, an attentiveness to the Word 
of God, a silent love. It achieves real union with the prayer of Christ to 
the extent that it makes us share in his mystery.

Article 2 THE BATTLE OF PRAYER 

2725 Prayer is both a gift of grace and a determined response on our 
part. It always presupposes effort. the great figures of prayer of the Old 
Covenant before Christ, as well as the Mother of God, the saints, and 
he himself, all teach us this: prayer is a battle. Against whom? Against 
ourselves and against the wiles of the tempter who does all he can to 
turn man away from prayer, away from union with God. We pray as we 
live, because we live as we pray. If we do not want to act habitually 
according to the Spirit of Christ, neither can we pray habitually in his 
name. the "spiritual battle" of the Christian's new life is inseparable 
from the battle of prayer.

Article 2 THE BATTLE OF PRAYER 

 

 

I. Objections to Prayer 

2726 In the battle of prayer, we must face in ourselves and around us 
erroneous notions of prayer. Some people view prayer as a simple 
psychological activity, others as an effort of concentration to reach a 
mental void. Still others reduce prayer to ritual words and postures. 
Many Christians unconsciously regard prayer as an occupation that is 
incompatible with all the other things they have to do: they "don't have 
the time." Those who seek God by prayer are quickly discouraged 
because they do not know that prayer comes also from the Holy Spirit 
and not from themselves alone. 



2727 We must also face the fact that certain attitudes deriving from the 
mentality of "this present world" can penetrate our lives if we are not 
vigilant. For example, some would have it that only that is true which 
can be verified by reason and science; yet prayer is a mystery that 
overflows both our conscious and unconscious lives. Others overly 
prize production and profit; thus prayer, being unproductive, is useless. 
Still others exalt sensuality and comfort as the criteria of the true, the 
good, and the beautiful; whereas prayer, the "love of beauty" 
(philokalia), is caught up in the glory of the living and true God. 
Finally, some see prayer as a flight from the world in reaction against 
activism; but in fact, Christian prayer is neither an escape from reality 
nor a divorce from life. 

2728 Finally, our battle has to confront what we experience as failure 
in prayer: discouragement during periods of dryness; sadness that, 
because we have "great possessions,"15 we have not given all to the 
Lord; disappointment over not being heard according to our own will; 
wounded pride, stiffened by the indignity that is ours as sinners; our 
resistance to the idea that prayer is a free and unmerited gift; and so 
forth. the conclusion is always the same: what good does it do to pray? 
To overcome these obstacles, we must battle to gain humility, trust, 
and perseverance.

II. Humble Vigilance of Heart 

Facing difficulties in prayer 

2729 The habitual difficulty in prayer is distraction. It can affect words 
and their meaning in vocal prayer; it can concern, more profoundly, 
him to whom we are praying, in vocal prayer (liturgical or personal), 
meditation, and contemplative prayer. To set about hunting down 
distractions would be to fall into their trap, when all that is necessary is 
to turn back to our heart: for a distraction reveals to us what we are 
attached to, and this humble awareness before the Lord should awaken 
our preferential love for him and lead us resolutely to offer him our 



heart to be purified. Therein lies the battle, the choice of which master 
to serve.16 

2730 In positive terms, the battle against the possessive and 
dominating self requires vigilance, sobriety of heart. When Jesus insists 
on vigilance, he always relates it to himself, to his coming on the last 
day and every day: today. the bridegroom comes in the middle of the 
night; the light that must not be extinguished is that of faith: "'Come,' 
my heart says, 'seek his face!'"17 

2731 Another difficulty, especially for those who sincerely want to pray, 
is dryness. Dryness belongs to contemplative prayer when the heart is 
separated from God, with no taste for thoughts, memories, and 
feelings, even spiritual ones. This is the moment of sheer faith clinging 
faithfully to Jesus in his agony and in his tomb. "Unless a grain of 
wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if dies, it bears 
much fruit."18 If dryness is due to the lack of roots, because the word 
has fallen on rocky soil, the battle requires conversion.19 

Facing temptations in prayer 

2732 The most common yet most hidden temptation is our lack of 
faith. It expresses itself less by declared incredulity than by our actual 
preferences. When we begin to pray, a thousand labors or cares thought 
to be urgent vie for priority; once again, it is the moment of truth for 
the heart: what is its real love? Sometimes we turn to the Lord as a last 
resort, but do we really believe he is? Sometimes we enlist the Lord as 
an ally, but our heart remains presumptuous. In each case, our lack of 
faith reveals that we do not yet share in the disposition of a humble 
heart:  

"Apart from me, you can do nothing."20 

2733 Another temptation, to which presumption opens the gate, is 
acedia. the spiritual writers understand by this a form of depression 
due to lax ascetical practice, decreasing vigilance, carelessness of heart. 
"The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."21 The greater the 
height, the harder the fall. Painful as discouragement is, it is the reverse 
of presumption. the humble are not surprised by their distress; it leads 
them to trust more, to hold fast in constancy.

III. Filial Trust 

2734 Filial trust is tested - it proves itself - in tribulation.22 The 
principal difficulty concerns the prayer of petition, for oneself or for 
others in intercession. Some even stop praying because they think their 
petition is not heard. Here two questions should be asked: Why do we 
think our petition has not been heard? How is our prayer heard, how is 
it "efficacious"?  

Why do we complain of not being heard? 

2735 In the first place, we ought to be astonished by this fact: when we 
praise God or give him thanks for his benefits in general, we are not 



particularly concerned whether or not our prayer is acceptable to him. 
On the other hand, we demand to see the results of our petitions. What 
is the image of God that motivates our prayer: an instrument to be 
used? or the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ? 

2736 Are we convinced that "we do not know how to pray as we 
ought"?23 Are we asking God for "what is good for us"? Our Father 
knows what we need before we ask him,24 but he awaits our petition 
because the dignity of his children lies in their freedom. We must pray, 
then, with his Spirit of freedom, to be able truly to know what he 
wants.25 

2737 "You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it 
on your passions."26 If we ask with a divided heart, we are 
"adulterers";27 God cannot answer us, for he desires our well-being, 
our life. "Or do you suppose that it is in vain that the scripture says, 
'He yearns jealously over the spirit which he has made to dwell in 
us?'"28 That our God is "jealous" for us is the sign of how true his love 
is. If we enter into the desire of his Spirit, we shall be heard. 

Do not be troubled if you do not immediately receive from God what 
you ask him; for he desires to do something even greater for you, while 
you cling to him in prayer.29 

God wills that our desire should be exercised in prayer, that we may be 
able to receive what he is prepared to give.30 

How is our prayer efficacious? 

2738 The revelation of prayer in the economy of salvation teaches us 
that faith rests on God's action in history. Our filial trust is enkindled 
by his supreme act: the Passion and Resurrection of his Son. Christian 
prayer is cooperation with his providence, his plan of love for men. 

2739 For St. Paul, this trust is bold, founded on the prayer of the Spirit 
in us and on the faithful love of the Father who has given us his only 
Son.31 Transformation of the praying heart is the first response to our 
petition. 

2740 The prayer of Jesus makes Christian prayer an efficacious 
petition. He is its model, he prays in us and with us. Since the heart of 



the Son seeks only what pleases the Father, how could the prayer of the 
children of adoption be centered on the gifts rather than the Giver? 

2741 Jesus also prays for us - in our place and on our behalf. All our 
petitions were gathered up, once for all, in his cry on the Cross and, in 
his Resurrection, heard by the Father. This is why he never ceases to 
intercede for us with the Father.32 If our prayer is resolutely united 
with that of Jesus, in trust and boldness as children, we obtain all that 
we ask in his name, even more than any particular thing: the Holy 
Spirit himself, who contains all gifts.

IV. Perservering in Love 

2742 "Pray constantly . . . always and for everything giving thanks in 
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father."33 St. Paul 
adds, "Pray at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. 
To that end keep alert with all perseverance making supplication for all 
the saints."34 For "we have not been commanded to work, to keep 
watch and to fast constantly, but it has been laid down that we are to 
pray without ceasing."35 This tireless fervor can come only from love. 
Against our dullness and laziness, the battle of prayer is that of humble, 
trusting, and persevering love. This love opens our hearts to three 
enlightening and life-giving facts of faith about prayer. 

2743 It is always possible to pray: the time of the Christian is that of 
the risen Christ who is with us always, no matter what tempests may 
arise.36 Our time is in the hands of God: 

It is possible to offer fervent prayer even while walking in public or 
strolling alone, or seated in your shop, . . . while buying or selling, . . . 
or even while cooking.37 



2744 Prayer is a vital necessity. Proof from the contrary is no less 
convincing: if we do not allow the Spirit to lead us, we fall back into 
the slavery of sin.38 How can the Holy Spirit be our life if our heart is 
far from him? 

Nothing is equal to prayer; for what is impossible it makes possible, 
what is difficult, easy.... For it is impossible, utterly impossible, for the 
man who prays eagerly and invokes God ceaselessly ever to sin.39 

  

Those who pray are certainly saved; those who do not pray are 
certainly damned40 

2745 Prayer and Christian life are inseparable, for they concern the 
same love and the same renunciation, proceeding from love; the same 
filial and loving conformity with the Father's plan of love; the same 
transforming union in the Holy Spirit who conforms us more and 
more to Christ Jesus; the same love for all men, the love with which 
Jesus has loved us. "Whatever you ask the Father in my name, he [will] 
give it to you. This I command you, to love one another."41 

He "prays without ceasing" who unites prayer to works and good works 
to prayer. Only in this way can we consider as realizable the principle 
of praying without ceasing.42

Article 3 THE PRAYER OF THE HOUR OF JESUS 

2746 When "his hour" came, Jesus prayed to the Father.43 His prayer, 
the longest transmitted by the Gospel, embraces the whole economy of 
creation and salvation, as well as his death and Resurrection. the prayer 
of the Hour of Jesus always remains his own, just as his Passover "once 
for all" remains ever present in the liturgy of his Church. 

2747 Christian Tradition rightly calls this prayer the "priestly" prayer of 
Jesus. It is the prayer of our high priest, inseparable from his sacrifice, 
from his passing over (Passover) to the Father to whom he is wholly 
"consecrated."44 

2748 In this Paschal and sacrificial prayer, everything is recapitulated 
in Christ:45 God and the world; the Word and the flesh; eternal life 
and time; the love that hands itself over and the sin that betrays it; the 



disciples present and those who will believe in him by their word; 
humiliation and glory. It is the prayer of unity. 

2749 Jesus fulfilled the work of the Father completely; his prayer, like 
his sacrifice, extends until the end of time. the prayer of this hour fills 
the end-times and carries them toward their consummation. Jesus, the 
Son to whom the Father has given all things, has given himself wholly 
back to the Father, yet expresses himself with a sovereign freedom46 
by virtue of the power the Father has given him over all flesh. the Son, 
who made himself Servant, is Lord, the Pantocrator. Our high priest 
who prays for us is also the one who prays in us and the God who 
hears our prayer. 

2750 By entering into the holy name of the Lord Jesus we can accept, 
from within, the prayer he teaches us: "Our Father!" His priestly prayer 
fulfills, from within, the great petitions of the Lord's Prayer: concern 
for the Father's name;47 passionate zeal for his kingdom (Glory);48 
The accomplishment of the will of the Father, of his plan of 
salvation;49 and deliverance from evil.50 

2751 Finally, in this prayer Jesus reveals and gives to us the 
"knowledge," inseparably one, of the Father and of the Son,51 which is 
the very mystery of the life of prayer.

Article 3 THE PRAYER OF THE HOUR OF JESUS 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

2752 Prayer presupposes an effort, a fight against ourselves and the 
wiles of the Tempter. the battle of prayer is inseparable from the 
necessary "spiritual battle" to act habitually according to the Spirit of 
Christ: we pray as we live, because we live as we pray. 

2753 In the battle of prayer we must confront erroneous conceptions 
of prayer, various currents of thought, and our own experience of 
failure. We must respond with humility, trust, and perseverance to 
these temptations which cast doubt on the usefulness or even the 
possibility of prayer. 

2754 The principal difficulties in the practice of prayer are distraction 
and dryness. the remedy lies in faith, conversion, and vigilance of 
heart. 



2755 Two frequent temptations threaten prayer: lack of faith and 
acedia - a form of depression stemming from lax ascetical practice that 
leads to discouragement. 

2756 Filial trust is put to the test when we feel that our prayer is not 
always heard. the Gospel invites us to ask ourselves about the 
conformity of our prayer to the desire of the Spirit. 

2757 "Pray constantly" (1 Thess 5:17). It is always possible to pray. It 
is even a vital necessity. Prayer and Christian life are inseparable. 

2758 The prayer of the hour of Jesus, rightly called the "priestly prayer" 
(cf Jn 17), sums up the whole economy of creation and salvation. It 
fulfills the great petitions of the Our Father. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PART FOUR: CHRISTIAN PRAYER 

 

 

SECTION TWO THE LORD'S PRAYER 

I. "OUR FATHER!" 

2759 Jesus "was praying at a certain place, and when he ceased, one of 
his disciples said to him, 'Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his 
disciples.'"1 In response to this request the Lord entrusts to his 



disciples and to his Church the fundamental Christian prayer. St. Luke 
presents a brief text of five petitions,2 while St. Matthew gives a more 
developed version of seven petitions.3 The liturgical tradition of the 
Church has retained St. Matthew's text: 

Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom 
come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our 
daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who 
trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us 
from evil. 

2760 Very early on, liturgical usage concluded the Lord's Prayer with a 
doxology. In the Didache, we find, "For yours are the power and the 
glory for ever."4 The Apostolic Constitutions add to the beginning: 
"the kingdom," and this is the formula retained to our day in 
ecumenical prayer.5  

The Byzantine tradition adds after "the glory" the words "Father, Son, 
and Holy Spirit." the Roman Missal develops the last petition in the 
explicit perspective of "awaiting our blessed hope" and of the Second 
Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.6 Then comes the assembly's 
acclamation or the repetition of the doxology from the Apostolic 
Constitutions.

Article 1 "THE SUMMARY OF THE WHOLE GOSPEL" 



2761 The Lord's Prayer "is truly the summary of the whole gospel."7 
"Since the Lord . . . after handing over the practice of prayer, said 
elsewhere, 'Ask and you will receive,' and since everyone has petitions 
which are peculiar to his circumstances, the regular and appropriate 
prayer [the Lord's Prayer] is said first, as the foundation of further

I. At the Center of the Scriptures 

2762 After showing how the psalms are the principal food of Christian 
prayer and flow together in the petitions of the Our Father, St. 
Augustine concludes: 

Run through all the words of the holy prayers [in Scripture], and I do 
not think that you will find anything in them that is not contained and 
included in the Lord's Prayer.9 

2763 All the Scriptures - the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms - are 
fulfilled in Christ.10 The Gospel is this "Good News." Its first 
proclamation is summarized by St. Matthew in the Sermon on the 
Mount;11 The prayer to our Father is at the center of this 
proclamation. It is in this context that each petition bequeathed to us 
by the Lord is illuminated: 

The Lord's Prayer is the most perfect of prayers.... In it we ask, not 
only for all the things we can rightly desire, but also in the sequence 
that they should be desired. This prayer not only teaches us to ask for 
things, but also in what order we should desire them.12 

2764 The Sermon on the Mount is teaching for life, the Our Father is 
a prayer; but in both the one and the other the Spirit of the Lord gives 
new form to our desires, those inner movements that animate our lives. 
Jesus teaches us this new life by his words; he teaches us to ask for it by 
our prayer. the rightness of our life in him will depend on the rightness 
of our prayer.

II. The Lord's Prayer 

2765 The traditional expression "the Lord's Prayer" - oratio Dominica 
- means that the prayer to our Father is taught and given to us by the 
Lord Jesus. the prayer that comes to us from Jesus is truly unique: it is 
"of the Lord." On the one hand, in the words of this prayer the only 
Son gives us the words the Father gave him:13 he is the master of our 
prayer. On the other, as Word incarnate, he knows in his human heart 
the needs of his human brothers and sisters and reveals them to us: he 
is the model of our prayer. 

2766 But Jesus does not give us a formula to repeat mechanically.14 
As in every vocal prayer, it is through the Word of God that the Holy 
Spirit teaches the children of God to pray to their Father. Jesus not 
only gives us the words of our filial prayer; at the same time he gives us 
the Spirit by whom these words become in us "spirit and life."15 Even 
more, the proof and possibility of our filial prayer is that the Father 
"sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, 'Abba! Father!'"16 
Since our prayer sets forth our desires before God, it is again the 
Father, "he who searches the hearts of men," who "knows what is the 
mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints 
according to the will of God."17 The prayer to Our Father is inserted 
into the mysterious mission of the Son and of the Spirit.

III. The Prayer of the Church 

2767 This indivisible gift of the Lord's words and of the Holy Spirit 
who gives life to them in the hearts of believers has been received and 
lived by the Church from the beginning. the first communities prayed 
the Lord's Prayer three times a day,18 in place of the "Eighteen 
Benedictions" customary in Jewish piety. 

2768 According to the apostolic tradition, the Lord's Prayer is 
essentially rooted in liturgical prayer: 

[The Lord] teaches us to make prayer in common for all our brethren. 
For he did not say "my Father" who art in heaven, but "our" Father, 
offering petitions for the common body.19 

In all the liturgical traditions, the Lord's Prayer is an integral part of 
the major hours of the Divine Office. In the three sacraments of 
Christian initiation its ecclesial character is especially in evidence: 

2769 In Baptism and Confirmation, the handing on (traditio) of the 
Lord's Prayer signifies new birth into the divine life. Since Christian 
prayer is our speaking to God with the very word of God, those who 
are "born anew". . . through the living and abiding word of God"20 
learn to invoke their Father by the one Word he always hears. They can 
henceforth do so, for the seal of the Holy Spirit's anointing is indelibly 
placed on their hearts, ears, lips, indeed their whole filial being. This is 
why most of the patristic commentaries on the Our Father are 
addressed to catechumens and neophytes. When the Church prays the 
Lord's Prayer, it is always the people made up of the "new-born" who 
pray and obtain mercy.21 



2770 In the Eucharistic liturgy the Lord's Prayer appears as the prayer 
of the whole Church and there reveals its full meaning and efficacy. 
Placed between the anaphora (the Eucharistic prayer) and the 
communion, the Lord's Prayer sums up on the one hand all the 
petitions and intercessions expressed in the movement of the epiclesis 
and, on the other, knocks at the door of the Banquet of the kingdom 
which sacramental communion anticipates. 

2771 In the Eucharist, the Lord's Prayer also reveals the eschatological 
character of its petitions. It is the proper prayer of "the end-time," the 
time of salvation that began with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and 
will be fulfilled with the Lord's return. the petitions addressed to our 
Father, as distinct from the prayers of the old covenant, rely on the 
mystery of salvation already accomplished, once for all, in Christ 
crucified and risen. 

2772 From this unshakeable faith springs forth the hope that sustains 
each of the seven petitions, which express the groanings of the present 
age, this time of patience and expectation during which "it does not yet 
appear what we shall be."22 The Eucharist and the Lord's Prayer look

Article 1 "THE SUMMARY OF THE WHOLE GOSPEL" 



 

 

IN BRIEF 

2773 In response to his disciples' request "Lord, teach us to pray" (Lk 
11:1), Jesus entrusts them with the fundamental Christian prayer, the 
Our Father. 

2774 "The Lord's Prayer is truly the summary of the whole gospel,"24 
The "most perfect of prayers."25 It is at the center of the Scriptures. 

2775 It is called "the Lord's Prayer" because it comes to us from the 
Lord Jesus, the master and model of our prayer. 

2776 The Lord's Prayer is the quintessential prayer of the Church. It is 
an integral part of the major hours of the Divine Office and of the 
sacraments of Christian initiation: Baptism, Confirmation, and 
Eucharist. Integrated into the Eucharist it reveals the eschatological 
character of its petitions, hoping for the Lord, "until he comes" (1 Cor 
11:26).

Article 2 "OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN" 

I. "We Dare To Say" 

2777 In the Roman liturgy, the Eucharistic assembly is invited to pray 
to our heavenly Father with filial boldness; the Eastern liturgies 
develop and use similar expressions: "dare in all confidence," "make us 
worthy of...." From the burning bush Moses heard a voice saying to 
him, "Do not come near; put off your shoes from your feet, for the 
place on which you are standing is holy ground."26 Only Jesus could 
cross that threshold of the divine holiness, for "when he had made 
purification for sins," he brought us into the Father's presence: "Here 
am I, and the children God has given me."27 

Our awareness of our status as slaves would make us sink into the 
ground and our earthly condition would dissolve into dust, if the 
authority of our Father himself and the Spirit of his Son had not 
impelled us to this cry . . . 'Abba, Father!' . . . When would a mortal 
dare call God 'Father,' if man's innermost being were not animated by 
power from on high?"28 

2778 This power of the Spirit who introduces us to the Lord's Prayer is 
expressed in the liturgies of East and of West by the beautiful, 
characteristically Christian expression: parrhesia, straightforward 
simplicity, filial trust, joyous assurance, humble boldness, the certainty 
of being loved.29

Article 2 "OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN" 

 

 

II. Abba - "Father!" 

2779 Before we make our own this first exclamation of the Lord's 
Prayer, we must humbly cleanse our hearts of certain false images 
drawn "from this world." Humility makes us recognize that "no one 
knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except 
the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him," that is, 
"to little children."30 The purification of our hearts has to do with 
paternal or maternal images, stemming from our personal and cultural 
history, and influencing our relationship with God. God our Father 
transcends the categories of the created world. To impose our own 
ideas in this area "upon him" would be to fabricate idols to adore or 
pull down. To pray to the Father is to enter into his mystery as he is 
and as the Son has revealed him to us. 

The expression God the Father had never been revealed to anyone. 
When Moses himself asked God who he was, he heard another name. 
the Father's name has been revealed to us in the Son, for the name 
"Son" implies the new name "Father."31 

2780 We can invoke God as "Father" because he is revealed to us by his 
Son become man and because his Spirit makes him known to us. the 
personal relation of the Son to the Father is something that man 
cannot conceive of nor the angelic powers even dimly see: and yet, the 
Spirit of the Son grants a participation in that very relation to us who 
believe that Jesus is the Christ and that we are born of God.32 



2781 When we pray to the Father, we are in communion with him and 
with his Son, Jesus Christ.33 Then we know and recognize him with an 
ever new sense of wonder. the first phrase of the Our Father is a 
blessing of adoration before it is a supplication. For it is the glory of 
God that we should recognize him as "Father," the true God. We give 
him thanks for having revealed his name to us, for the gift of believing 
in it, and for the indwelling of his Presence in us. 

2782 We can adore the Father because he has caused us to be reborn 
to his life by adopting us as his children in his only Son: by Baptism, he 
incorporates us into the Body of his Christ; through the anointing of 
his Spirit who flows from the head to the members, he makes us other 
"Christs." 

God, indeed, who has predestined us to adoption as his sons, has 
conformed us to the glorious Body of Christ. So then you who have 
become sharers in Christ are appropriately called "Christs."34  

The new man, reborn and restored to his God by grace, says first of all, 
"Father!" because he has now begun to be a son.35 

2783 Thus the Lord's Prayer reveals us to ourselves at the same time 
that it reveals the Father to us.36 

O man, you did not dare to raise your face to heaven, you lowered your 
eyes to the earth, and suddenly you have received the grace of Christ 
all your sins have been forgiven. From being a wicked servant you have 
become a good son.... Then raise your eyes to the Father who has 
begotten you through Baptism, to the Father who has redeemed you 
through his Son, and say: "Our Father.... " But do not claim any 
privilege. He is the Father in a special way only of Christ, but he is the 
common Father of us all, because while he has begotten only Christ, 
he has created us. Then also say by his grace, "Our Father," so that you 
may merit being his son.37 

2784 The free gift of adoption requires on our part continual 
conversion and new life. Praying to our Father should develop in us 
two fundamental dispositions:  



First, the desire to become like him: though created in his image, we 
are restored to his likeness by grace; and we must respond to this 
grace. 

We must remember . . . and know that when we call God "our Father" 
we ought to behave as sons of God.38  

You cannot call the God of all kindness your Father if you preserve a 
cruel and inhuman heart; for in this case you no longer have in you the 
marks of the heavenly Father's kindness.39  

We must contemplate the beauty of the Father without ceasing and 
adorn our own souls accordingly.40 

2785 Second, a humble and trusting heart that enables us "to turn and 
become like children":41 for it is to "little children" that the Father is 
revealed.42 

[The prayer is accomplished] by the contemplation of God alone, and 
by the warmth of love, through which the soul, molded and directed to 
love him, speaks very familiarly to God as to its own Father with 
special devotion.43  

Our Father: at this name love is aroused in us . . . and the confidence 
of obtaining what we are about to ask.... What would he not give to his 
children who ask, since he has already granted them the gift of being 
his children?44

Article 2 "OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN" 

 

 

III. "Our" Father 

2786 "Our" Father refers to God. the adjective, as used by us, does not 
express possession, but an entirely new relationship with God. 

2787 When we say "our" Father, we recognize first that all his promises 
of love announced by the prophets are fulfilled in the new and eternal 
covenant in his Christ: we have become "his" people and he is 
henceforth "our" God. This new relationship is the purely gratuitous 
gift of belonging to each other: we are to respond to "grace and truth" 
given us in Jesus Christ with love and faithfulness.45 

2788 Since the Lord's Prayer is that of his people in the "endtime," this 
"our" also expresses the certitude of our hope in God's ultimate 
promise: in the new Jerusalem he will say to the victor, "I will be his 
God and he shall be my son."46 

2789 When we pray to "our" Father, we personally address the Father 
of our Lord Jesus Christ. By doing so we do not divide the Godhead, 
since the Father is its "source and origin," but rather confess that the 
Son is eternally begotten by him and the Holy Spirit proceeds from 
him. We are not confusing the persons, for we confess that our 
communion is with the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, in their one 
Holy Spirit. the Holy Trinity is consubstantial and indivisible. When we 
pray to the Father, we adore and glorify him together with the Son and 
the Holy Spirit. 

2790 Grammatically, "our" qualifies a reality common to more than 
one person. There is only one God, and he is recognized as Father by 
those who, through faith in his only Son, are reborn of him by water 
and the Spirit.47 The Church is this new communion of God and 
men. United with the only Son, who has become "the firstborn among 



many brethren," she is in communion with one and the same Father in 
one and the same Holy Spirit.48 In praying "our" Father, each of the 
baptized is praying in this communion: "The company of those who 
believed were of one heart and soul."49 

2791 For this reason, in spite of the divisions among Christians, this 
prayer to "our" Father remains our common patrimony and an urgent 
summons for all the baptized. In communion by faith in Christ and by 
Baptism, they ought to join in Jesus' prayer for the unity of his 
disciples.50 

2792 Finally, if we pray the Our Father sincerely, we leave 
individualism behind, because the love that we receive frees us from it. 
the "our" at the beginning of the Lord's Prayer, like the "us" of the last 
four petitions, excludes no one. If we are to say it truthfully, our 
divisions and oppositions have to be overcome.51 

2793 The baptized cannot pray to "our" Father without bringing 
before him all those for whom he gave his beloved Son. God's love has 
no bounds, neither should our prayer.52 Praying "our" Father opens to 
us the dimensions of his love revealed in Christ: praying with and for 
all who do not yet know him, so that Christ may "gather into one the 
children of God."53 God's care for all men and for the whole of 
creation has inspired all the great practitioners of prayer; it should 
extend our prayer to the full breadth of love whenever we dare to say 
"our" Father.

Article 2 "OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN" 

 

 

IV. "Who Art in Heaven" 

2794 This biblical expression does not mean a place (“space"), but a 
way of being; it does not mean that God is distant, but majestic. Our 
Father is not "elsewhere": he transcends everything we can conceive of 
his holiness. It is precisely because he is thrice holy that he is so close 
to the humble and contrite heart. 

"Our Father who art in heaven" is rightly understood to mean that 
God is in the hearts of the just, as in his holy temple. At the same time, 
it means that those who pray should desire the one they invoke to 
dwell in them.54  

"Heaven" could also be those who bear the image of the heavenly 
world, and in whom God dwells and tarries.55 

2795 The symbol of the heavens refers us back to the mystery of the 
covenant we are living when we pray to our Father. He is in heaven, his 
dwelling place; the Father's house is our homeland. Sin has exiled us 



from the land of the covenant,56 but conversion of heart enables us to 
return to the Father, to heaven.57 Jn Christ, then, heaven and earth 
are reconciled,58 for the Son alone "descended from heaven" and 
causes us to ascend there with him, by his Cross, Resurrection, and 
Ascension.59 

2796 When the Church prays "our Father who art in heaven," she is 
professing that we are the People of God, already seated "with him in 
the heavenly places in Christ Jesus" and "hidden with Christ in 
God;"60 yet at the same time, "here indeed we groan, and long to put 
on our heavenly dwelling."61 

[Christians] are in the flesh, but do not live according to the flesh. 
They spend their lives on earth, but are citizens of heaven.62

Article 2 "OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN" 

 

 

IN BRIEF 

2797 Simple and faithful trust, humble and joyous assurance are the 
proper dispositions for one who prays the Our Father. 

2798 We can invoke God as "Father" because the Son of God made 
man has revealed him to us. Jn this Son, through Baptism, we are 
incorporated and adopted as sons of God. 

2799 The Lord's Prayer brings us into communion with the Father and 
with his Son, Jesus Christ. At the same time it reveals us to ourselves 
(cf GS 22 # 1). 

2800 Praying to our Father should develop in us the will to become 
like him and foster in us a humble and trusting heart. 

2801 When we say "Our" Father, we are invoking the new covenant in 
Jesus Christ, communion with the Holy Trinity, and the divine love 
which spreads through the Church to encompass the world. 

2802 "Who art in heaven" does not refer to a place but to God's 
majesty and his presence in the hearts of the just. Heaven, the Father's 
house, is the true homeland toward which we are heading and to 
which, already, we belong.

Article 3 THE SEVEN PETITIONS 

2803 After we have placed ourselves in the presence of God our Father 
to adore and to love and to bless him, the Spirit of adoption stirs up in 
our hearts seven petitions, seven blessings. the first three, more 
theological, draw us toward the glory of the Father; the last four, as 
ways toward him, commend our wretchedness to his grace. "Deep calls 
to deep."63 

2804 The first series of petitions carries us toward him, for his own 
sake: thy name, thy kingdom, thy will! It is characteristic of love to 
think first of the one whom we love. In none of the three petitions do 
we mention ourselves; the burning desire, even anguish, of the beloved 
Son for his Father's glory seizes us:64 "hallowed be thy name, thy 
kingdom come, thy will be done...." These three supplications were 



already answered in the saving sacrifice of Christ, but they are 
henceforth directed in hope toward their final fulfillment, for God is 
not yet all in all.65 

2805 The second series of petitions unfolds with the same movement 
as certain Eucharistic epicleses: as an offering up of our expectations, 
that draws down upon itself the eyes of the Father of mercies. They go 
up from us and concern us from this very moment, in our present 
world: "give us . . . forgive us . . . lead us not ... deliver us...." the fourth 
and fifth petitions concern our life as such - to be fed and to be healed 
of sin; the last two concern our battle for the victory of life - that battle 
of prayer. 

2806 By the three first petitions, we are strengthened in faith, filled 
with hope, and set aflame by charity. Being creatures and still sinners, 
we have to petition for us, for that "us" bound by the world and history, 
which we offer to the boundless love of God. For through the name of 
his Christ and the reign of his Holy Spirit, our Father accomplishes his 
plan of salvation, for us and for the whole world.

Article 3 THE SEVEN PETITIONS 

 

 

I. "Hallowed be Thy Name" 

2807 The term "to hallow" is to be understood here not primarily in its 
causative sense (only God hallows, makes holy), but above all in an 
evaluative sense: to recognize as holy, to treat in a holy way. and so, in 
adoration, this invocation is sometimes understood as praise and 
thanksgiving.66 But this petition is here taught to us by Jesus as an 
optative: a petition, a desire, and an expectation in which God and 
man are involved. Beginning with this first petition to our Father, we 
are immersed in the innermost mystery of his Godhead and the drama 
of the salvation of our humanity. Asking the Father that his name be 
made holy draws us into his plan of loving kindness for the fullness of 



time, "according to his purpose which he set forth in Christ," that we 
might "be holy and blameless before him in love."67 

2808 In the decisive moments of his economy God reveals his name, 
but he does so by accomplishing his work. This work, then, is realized 
for us and in us only if his name is hallowed by us and in us. 

2809 The holiness of God is the inaccessible center of his eternal 
mystery. What is revealed of it in creation and history, Scripture calls 
"glory," the radiance of his majesty.68 In making man in his image and 
likeness, God "crowned him with glory and honor," but by sinning, 
man fell "short of the glory of God."69 From that time on, God was to 
manifest his holiness by revealing and giving his name, in order to 
restore man to the image of his Creator.70 

2810 In the promise to Abraham and the oath that accompanied it,71 
God commits himself but without disclosing his name. He begins to 
reveal it to Moses and makes it known clearly before the eyes of the 
whole people when he saves them from the Egyptians: "he has 
triumphed gloriously."72 From the covenant of Sinai onwards, this 
people is "his own" and it is to be a "holy (or "consecrated": the same 
word is used for both in Hebrew) nation,"73 because the name of God 
dwells in it. 

2811 In spite of the holy Law that again and again their Holy God 
gives them - "You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy" - 
and although the Lord shows patience for the sake of his name, the 
people turn away from the Holy One of Israel and profane his name 
among the nations.74 For this reason the just ones of the old covenant, 
the poor survivors returned from exile, and the prophets burned with 
passion for the name. 

2812 Finally, in Jesus the name of the Holy God is revealed and given 
to us, in the flesh, as Savior, revealed by what he is, by his word, and by 
his sacrifice.75 This is the heart of his priestly prayer: "Holy Father . . . 
for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be consecrated in 
truth."76 Because he "sanctifies" his own name, Jesus reveals to us the 
name of the Father.77 At the end of Christ's Passover, the Father gives 
him the name that is above all names: "Jesus Christ is Lord, to the 
glory of God the Father."78 



2813 In the waters of Baptism, we have been "washed . . . sanctified . . . 
justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our 
God."79 Our Father calls us to holiness in the whole of our life, and 
since "he is the source of (our) life in Christ Jesus, who became for us 
wisdom from God, and . . .sanctification,"80 both his glory and our life 
depend on the hallowing of his name in us and by us. Such is the 
urgency of our first petition. 

By whom is God hallowed, since he is the one who hallows? But since 
he said, "You shall be holy to me; for I the LORD am holy," we seek 
and ask that we who were sanctified in Baptism may persevere in what 
we have begun to be. and we ask this daily, for we need sanctification 
daily, so that we who fail daily may cleanse away our sins by being 
sanctified continually.... We pray that this sanctification may remain in 
us.81 

2814 The sanctification of his name among the nations depends 
inseparably on our life and our prayer: 

We ask God to hallow his name, which by its own holiness saves and 
makes holy all creation .... It is this name that gives salvation to a lost 
world. But we ask that this name of God should be hallowed in us 
through our actions. For God's name is blessed when we live well, but 
is blasphemed when we live wickedly. As the Apostle says: "The name 
of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you." We ask 
then that, just as the name of God is holy, so we may obtain his 
holiness in our souls.82  

When we say "hallowed be thy name," we ask that it should be 
hallowed in us, who are in him; but also in others whom God's grace 
still awaits, that we may obey the precept that obliges us to pray for 
everyone, even our enemies. That is why we do not say expressly 
"hallowed be thy name 'in us,"' for we ask that it be so in all men.83 

2815 This petition embodies all the others. Like the six petitions that 
follow, it is fulfilled by the prayer of Christ. Prayer to our Father is our 
prayer, if it is prayed in the name of Jesus.84 In his priestly prayer, 
Jesus asks: "Holy Father, protect in your name those whom you have 
given me."85

II. "Thy Kingdom Come" 

2816 In the New Testament, the word basileia can be translated by 
"kingship" (abstract noun), "kingdom" (concrete noun) or "reign" 
(action noun). the Kingdom of God lies ahead of us. It is brought near 
in the Word incarnate, it is proclaimed throughout the whole Gospel, 
and it has come in Christ's death and Resurrection. the Kingdom of 
God has been coming since the Last Supper and, in the Eucharist, it is 
in our midst. the kingdom will come in glory when Christ hands it over 
to his Father: 

It may even be . . . that the Kingdom of God means Christ himself, 
whom we daily desire to come, and whose coming we wish to be 
manifested quickly to us. For as he is our resurrection, since in him we 
rise, so he can also be understood as the Kingdom of God, for in him 
we shall reign.86 

2817 This petition is "Marana tha," the cry of the Spirit and the Bride: 
"Come, Lord Jesus." 

Even if it had not been prescribed to pray for the coming of the 
kingdom, we would willingly have brought forth this speech, eager to 
embrace our hope. In indignation the souls of the martyrs under the 
altar cry out to the Lord: "O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long 
before you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell upon the 
earth?" For their retribution is ordained for the end of the world. 
Indeed as soon as possible, Lord, may your kingdom come!87 

2818 In the Lord's Prayer, "thy kingdom come" refers primarily to the 
final coming of the reign of God through Christ's return.88 But, far 
from distracting the Church from her mission in this present world, 
this desire commits her to it all the more strongly. Since Pentecost, the 
coming of that Reign is the work of the Spirit of the Lord who 
"complete(s) his work on earth and brings us the fullness of grace."89 



2819 "The kingdom of God (is) righteousness and peace and joy in the 
Holy Spirit."90 The end-time in which we live is the age of the 
outpouring of the Spirit. Ever since Pentecost, a decisive battle has 
been joined between "the flesh" and the Spirit.91 

Only a pure soul can boldly say: "Thy kingdom come." One who has 
heard Paul say, "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies," and 
has purified himself in action, thought and word will say to God: "Thy 
kingdom come!"92 

2820 By a discernment according to the Spirit, Christians have to 
distinguish between the growth of the Reign of God and the progress 
of the culture and society in which they are involved. This distinction is 
not a separation. Man's vocation to eternal life does not suppress, but 
actually reinforces, his duty to put into action in this world the energies 
and means received from the Creator to serve justice and peace.93 

2821 This petition is taken up and granted in the prayer of Jesus which 
is present and effective in the Eucharist; it bears its fruit in new life in 
keeping with the Beatitudes.94

III. "Thy Will Be Done on Earth as It is in Heaven" 

2822 Our Father "desires all men to be saved and to come to the 
knowledge of the truth."95 He "is forbearing toward you, not wishing 
that any should perish."96 His commandment is "that you love one 
another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another."97 
This commandment summarizes all the others and expresses his entire 
will. 

2823 "He has made known to us the mystery of his will, according to 
his good pleasure that he set forth in Christ . . . to gather up all things 
in him, things in heaven and things on earth. In Christ we have also 
obtained an inheritance, having been destined according to the 
purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel 
and will."98 We ask insistently for this loving plan to be fully realized 
on earth as it is already in heaven. 

2824 In Christ, and through his human will, the will of the Father has 
been perfectly fulfilled once for all. Jesus said on entering into this 
world: "Lo, I have come to do your will, O God."99 Only Jesus can say: 
"I always do what is pleasing to him."100 In the prayer of his agony, he 
consents totally to this will: "not my will, but yours be done."101 For 
this reason Jesus "gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the 



present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father."102 "and 
by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of 
Jesus Christ once for all."103 

2825 "Although he was a Son, [Jesus] learned obedience through what 
he suffered."104 How much more reason have we sinful creatures to 
learn obedience - we who in him have become children of adoption. 
We ask our Father to unite our will to his Son's, in order to fulfill his 
will, his plan of salvation for the life of the world. We are radically 
incapable of this, but united with Jesus and with the power of his Holy 
Spirit, we can surrender our will to him and decide to choose what his 
Son has always chosen: to do what is pleasing to the Father.105 

In committing ourselves to [Christ], we can become one spirit with 
him, and thereby accomplish his will, in such wise that it will be perfect 
on earth as it is in heaven.106 

  

Consider how Jesus Christ] teaches us to be humble, by making us see 
that our virtue does not depend on our work alone but on grace from 
on high. He commands each of the faithful who prays to do so 
universally, for the whole world. For he did not say "thy will be done in 
me or in us," but "on earth," the whole earth, so that error may be 
banished from it, truth take root in it, all vice be destroyed on it, virtue 
flourish on it, and earth no longer differ from heaven.107 

2826 By prayer we can discern "what is the will of God" and obtain the 
endurance to do it.108 Jesus teaches us that one enters the kingdom of 
heaven not by speaking words, but by doing "the will of my Father in 
heaven."109 

2827 "If any one is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens 
to him."110 Such is the power of the Church's prayer in the name of 
her Lord, above all in the Eucharist. Her prayer is also a communion of 
intercession with the all-holy Mother of God111 and all the saints who 
have been pleasing to the Lord because they willed his will alone: 

It would not be inconsistent with the truth to understand the words, 
"Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven," to mean: "in the Church 
as in our Lord Jesus Christ himself"; or "in the Bride who has been 



betrothed, just as in the Bridegroom who has accomplished the will of 
the Father."112

IV. "Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread" 

2828 "Give us": the trust of children who look to their Father for 
everything is beautiful. "He makes his sun rise on the evil and on the 
good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."113 He gives to all 
the living "their food in due season."114 Jesus teaches us this petition, 
because it glorifies our Father by acknowledging how good he is, 
beyond all goodness. 

2829 "Give us" also expresses the covenant. We are his and he is ours, 
for our sake. But this "us" also recognizes him as the Father of all men 
and we pray to him for them all, in solidarity with their needs and 
sufferings. 

2830 "Our bread": the Father who gives us life cannot not but give us 
the nourishment life requires - all appropriate goods and blessings, 
both material and spiritual. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus insists 
on the filial trust that cooperates with our Father's providence.115 He 
is not inviting us to idleness,116 but wants to relieve us from nagging 
worry and preoccupation. Such is the filial surrender of the children of 
God: 

To those who seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness, he has 
promised to give all else besides. Since everything indeed belongs to 
God, he who possesses God wants for nothing, if he himself is not 
found wanting before God.117 

2831 But the presence of those who hunger because they lack bread 
opens up another profound meaning of this petition. the drama of 
hunger in the world calls Christians who pray sincerely to exercise 
responsibility toward their brethren, both in their personal behavior 
and in their solidarity with the human family. This petition of the 
Lord's Prayer cannot be isolated from the parables of the poor man 
Lazarus and of the Last Judgment.118 

2832 As leaven in the dough, the newness of the kingdom should make 
the earth "rise" by the Spirit of Christ.119 This must be shown by the 
establishment of justice in personal and social, economic and 
international relations, without ever forgetting that there are no just 
structures without people who want to be just. 



2833 "Our" bread is the "one" loaf for the "many." In the Beatitudes 
"poverty" is the virtue of sharing: it calls us to communicate and share 
both material and spiritual goods, not by coercion but out of love, so 
that the abundance of some may remedy the needs of others.120 

2834 "Pray and work."121 "Pray as if everything depended on God 
and work as if everything depended on you."122 Even when we have 
done our work, the food we receive is still a gift from our Father; it is 
good to ask him for it, as Christian families do when saying grace at 
meals. 

2835 This petition, with the responsibility it involves, also applies to 
another hunger from which men are perishing: "Man does not live by 
bread alone, but . . . by every word that proceeds from the mouth of 
God,"123 that is, by the Word he speaks and the Spirit he breathes 
forth. Christians must make every effort "to proclaim the good news to 
the poor." There is a famine on earth, "not a famine of bread, nor a 
thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD."124 For this 
reason the specifically Christian sense of this fourth petition concerns 
the Bread of Life: the Word of God accepted in faith, the Body of 
Christ received in the Eucharist.125 

2836 "This day" is also an expression of trust taught us by the 
Lord,126 which we would never have presumed to invent. Since it 
refers above all to his Word and to the Body of his Son, this "today" is 
not only that of our mortal time, but also the "today" of God. 

If you receive the bread each day, each day is today for you. If Christ is 
yours today, he rises for you every day. How can this be? "You are my 
Son, today I have begotten you." Therefore, "today" is when Christ 
rises.127 

2837 "Daily" (epiousios) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. 
Taken in a temporal sense, this word is a pedagogical repetition of "this 
day,"128 to confirm us in trust "without reservation." Taken in the 
qualitative sense, it signifies what is necessary for life, and more 
broadly every good thing sufficient for subsistence.129 Taken literally 
(epi-ousios: "super-essential"), it refers directly to the Bread of Life, the 
Body of Christ, the "medicine of immortality," without which we have 
no life within us.130 Finally in this connection, its heavenly meaning is 



evident: "this day" is the Day of the Lord, the day of the feast of the 
kingdom, anticipated in the Eucharist that is already the foretaste of 
the kingdom to come. For this reason it is fitting for the Eucharistic 
liturgy to be celebrated each day. 

The Eucharist is our daily bread. the power belonging to this divine 
food makes it a bond of union. Its effect is then understood as unity, so 
that, gathered into his Body and made members of him, we may 
become what we receive.... This also is our daily bread: the readings 
you hear each day in church and the hymns you hear and sing. All 
these are necessities for our pilgrimage.131 

  

The Father in heaven urges us, as children of heaven, to ask for the 
bread of heaven. [Christ] himself is the bread who, sown in the Virgin, 
raised up in the flesh, kneaded in the Passion, baked in the oven of the 
tomb, reserved in churches, brought to altars, furnishes the faithful 
each day with food from heaven.132

Article 3 THE SEVEN PETITIONS 

 

 

V. "And Forgive Us Our Trespasses, as We Forgive Those Who Trespass 
AGAINST US" 

2838 This petition is astonishing. If it consisted only of the first phrase, 
"and forgive us our trespasses," it might have been included, implicitly, 
in the first three petitions of the Lord's Prayer, since Christ's sacrifice is 
"that sins may be forgiven." But, according to the second phrase, our 
petition will not be heard unless we have first met a strict requirement. 
Our petition looks to the future, but our response must come first, for 
the two parts are joined by the single word "as." 

and forgive us our trespasses . . . 



2839 With bold confidence, we began praying to our Father. In 
begging him that his name be hallowed, we were in fact asking him 
that we ourselves might be always made more holy. But though we are 
clothed with the baptismal garment, we do not cease to sin, to turn 
away from God. Now, in this new petition, we return to him like the 
prodigal son and, like the tax collector, recognize that we are sinners 
before him.133 Our petition begins with a "confession" of our 
wretchedness and his mercy. Our hope is firm because, in his Son, "we 
have redemption, the forgiveness of sins."134 We find the efficacious 
and undoubted sign of his forgiveness in the sacraments of his 
Church.135 

2840 Now - and this is daunting - this outpouring of mercy cannot 
penetrate our hearts as long as we have not forgiven those who have 
trespassed against us. Love, like the Body of Christ, is indivisible; we 
cannot love the God we cannot see if we do not love the brother or 
sister we do see.136 In refusing to forgive our brothers and sisters, our 
hearts are closed and their hardness makes them impervious to the 
Father's merciful love; but in confessing our sins, our hearts are opened 
to his grace. 

2841 This petition is so important that it is the only one to which the 
Lord returns and which he develops explicitly in the Sermon on the 
Mount.137 This crucial requirement of the covenant mystery is 
impossible for man. But "with God all things are possible."138  

. . . as we forgive those who trespass against us 

2842 This "as" is not unique in Jesus' teaching: "You, therefore, must 
be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect"; "Be merciful, even as 
your Father is merciful"; "A new commandment I give to you, that you 
love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one 
another."139 It is impossible to keep the Lord's commandment by 
imitating the divine model from outside; there has to be a vital 
participation, coming from the depths of the heart, in the holiness and 
the mercy and the love of our God. Only the Spirit by whom we live 
can make "ours" the same mind that was in Christ Jesus.140 Then the 
unity of forgiveness becomes possible and we find ourselves "forgiving 
one another, as God in Christ forgave" us.141 



2843 Thus the Lord's words on forgiveness, the love that loves to the 
end,142 become a living reality. the parable of the merciless servant, 
which crowns the Lord's teaching on ecclesial communion, ends with 
these words: "So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if 
you do not forgive your brother from your heart."143 It is there, in 
fact, "in the depths of the heart," that everything is bound and loosed. 
It is not in our power not to feel or to forget an offense; but the heart 
that offers itself to the Holy Spirit turns injury into compassion and 
purifies the memory in transforming the hurt into intercession. 

2844 Christian prayer extends to the forgiveness of enemies,144 
transfiguring the disciple by configuring him to his Master. Forgiveness 
is a high-point of Christian prayer; only hearts attuned to God's 
compassion can receive the gift of prayer. Forgiveness also bears 
witness that, in our world, love is stronger than sin. the martyrs of 
yesterday and today bear this witness to Jesus. Forgiveness is the 
fundamental condition of the reconciliation of the children of God 
with their Father and of men with one another.145 

2845 There is no limit or measure to this essentially divine 
forgiveness,146 whether one speaks of "sins" as in Luke (? 11:4), 
"debts" as in Matthew (? 6:12). We are always debtors: "Owe no one 
anything, except to love one another."147 The communion of the Holy 
Trinity is the source and criterion of truth in every relation ship. It is 
lived out in prayer, above all in the Eucharist.148 

God does not accept the sacrifice of a sower of disunion, but 
commands that he depart from the altar so that he may first be 
reconciled with his brother. For God can be appeased only by prayers 
that make peace. To God, the better offering is peace, brotherly 
concord, and a people made one in the unity of the Father, Son, and 
Holy Spirit.149

Article 3 THE SEVEN PETITIONS 

 

 

VI. "And Lead Us not into Temptation" 

2846 This petition goes to the root of the preceding one, for our sins 
result from our consenting to temptation; we therefore ask our Father 
not to "lead" us into temptation. It is difficult to translate the Greek 
verb used by a single English word: the Greek means both "do not 
allow us to enter into temptation" and "do not let us yield to 
temptation."150 "God cannot be tempted by evil and he himself 
tempts no one";151 on the contrary, he wants to set us free from evil. 



We ask him not to allow us to take the way that leads to sin. We are 
engaged in the battle "between flesh and spirit"; this petition implores 
the Spirit of discernment and strength. 

2847 The Holy Spirit makes us discern between trials, which are 
necessary for the growth of the inner man,152 and temptation, which 
leads to sin and death.153 We must also discern between being 
tempted and consenting to temptation. Finally, discernment unmasks 
the lie of temptation, whose object appears to be good, a "delight to the 
eyes" and desirable,154 when in reality its fruit is death.  

God does not want to impose the good, but wants free beings.... There 
is a certain usefulness to temptation. No one but God knows what our 
soul has received from him, not even we ourselves. But temptation 
reveals it in order to teach us to know ourselves, and in this way we 
discover our evil inclinations and are obliged to give thanks for the 
goods that temptation has revealed to us.155 

2848 "Lead us not into temptation" implies a decision of the heart: 
"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.... No one can 
serve two masters."156 "If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the 
Spirit."157 In this assent to the Holy Spirit the Father gives us 
strength. "No testing has overtaken you that is not common to man. 
God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your 
strength, but with the temptation will also provide the way of escape, 
so that you may be able to endure it."158 

2849 Such a battle and such a victory become possible only through 
prayer. It is by his prayer that Jesus vanquishes the tempter, both at the 
outset of his public mission and in the ultimate struggle of his 
agony.159 In this petition to our heavenly Father, Christ unites us to 
his battle and his agony. He urges us to vigilance of the heart in 
communion with his own. Vigilance is "custody of the heart," and Jesus 
prayed for us to the Father: "Keep them in your name."160 The Holy 
Spirit constantly seeks to awaken us to keep watch.161 Finally, this 
petition takes on all its dramatic meaning in relation to the last 
temptation of our earthly battle; it asks for final perseverance. "Lo, I 
am coming like a thief! Blessed is he who is awake."162 

VII "BUT DELIVER US FROM EVIL" 



2850 The last petition to our Father is also included in Jesus' prayer: "I 
am not asking you to take them out of the world, but I ask you to 
protect them from the evil one."163 It touches each of us personally, 
but it is always "we" who pray, in communion with the whole Church, 
for the deliverance of the whole human family. the Lord's Prayer 
continually opens us to the range of God's economy of salvation. Our 
interdependence in the drama of sin and death is turned into solidarity 
in the Body of Christ, the "communion of saints."164 

2851 In this petition, evil is not an abstraction, but refers to a person, 
Satan, the Evil One, the angel who opposes God. the devil (dia-bolos) 
is the one who "throws himself across" God's plan and his work of 
salvation accomplished in Christ. 

2852 "A murderer from the beginning, . . . a liar and the father of lies," 
Satan is "the deceiver of the whole world."165 Through him sin and 
death entered the world and by his definitive defeat all creation will be 
"freed from the corruption of sin and death."166 Now "we know that 
anyone born of God does not sin, but He who was born of God keeps 
him, and the evil one does not touch him.  

We know that we are of God, and the whole world is in the power of 
the evil one."167 

The Lord who has taken away your sin and pardoned your faults also 
protects you and keeps you from the wiles of your adversary the devil, 
so that the enemy, who is accustomed to leading into sin, may not 
surprise you. One who entrusts himself to God does not dread the 
devil. "If God is for us, who is against us?"168 

2853 Victory over the "prince of this world"169 was won once for all at 
the Hour when Jesus freely gave himself up to death to give us his life. 
This is the judgment of this world, and the prince of this world is "cast 
out."170 "He pursued the woman"171 but had no hold on her: the 
new Eve, "full of grace" of the Holy Spirit, is preserved from sin and 
the corruption of death (the Immaculate Conception and the 
Assumption of the Most Holy Mother of God, Mary, ever virgin). 
"Then the dragon was angry with the woman, and went off to make 
war on the rest of her offspring."172 Therefore the Spirit and the 



Church pray: "Come, Lord Jesus,"173 since his coming will deliver us 
from the Evil One. 

2854 When we ask to be delivered from the Evil One, we pray as well 
to be freed from all evils, present, past, and future, of which he is the 
author or instigator. In this final petition, the Church brings before the 
Father all the distress of the world. Along with deliverance from the 
evils that overwhelm humanity, she implores the precious gift of peace 
and the grace of perseverance in expectation of Christ's return By 
praying in this way, she anticipates in humility of faith the gathering 
together of everyone and everything in him who has "the keys of Death 
and Hades," who "is and who was and who is to come, the 
Almighty."174 

Deliver us, Lord, we beseech you, from every evil and grant us peace in 
our day, so that aided by your mercy we might be ever free from sin 
and protected from all anxiety, as we await the blessed hope and the 
coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.175

Article 4 THE FINAL DOXOLOGY 

2855 The final doxology, "For the kingdom, the power and the glory 
are yours, now and forever," takes up again, by inclusion, the first three 
petitions to our Father: the glorification of his name, the coming of his 
reign, and the power of his saving will. But these prayers are now 
proclaimed as adoration and thanksgiving, as in the liturgy of 
heaven.176 The ruler of this world has mendaciously attributed to 
himself the three titles of kingship, power, and glory.177 Christ, the 
Lord, restores them to his Father and our Father, until he hands over 
the kingdom to him when the mystery of salvation will be brought to 
its completion and God will be all in all.178 

2856 "Then, after the prayer is over you say 'Amen,' which means 'So 
be it,' thus ratifying with our 'Amen' what is contained in the prayer 
that God has taught us."179

Article 4 THE FINAL DOXOLOGY 

 

IN BRIEF 

2857 In the Our Father, the object of the first three petitions is the 
glory of the Father: the sanctification of his name, the coming of the 
kingdom, and the fulfillment of his will. the four others present our 
wants to him: they ask that our lives be nourished, healed of sin, and 
made victorious in the struggle of good over evil. 

2858 By asking "hallowed be thy name" we enter into God's plan, the 
sanctification of his name - revealed first to Moses and then in Jesus - 
by us and in us, in every nation and in each man. 

2859 By the second petition, the Church looks first to Christ's return 
and the final coming of the Reign of God. It also prays for the growth 
of the Kingdom of God in the "today" of our own lives. 

2860 In the third petition, we ask our Father to unite our will to that of 
his Son, so as to fulfill his plan of salvation in the life of the world. 

2861 In the fourth petition, by saying "give us," we express in 
communion with our brethren our filial trust in our heavenly Father. 
"Our daily bread" refers to the earthly nourishment necessary to 
everyone for subsistence, and also to the Bread of Life: the Word of 
God and the Body of Christ. It is received in God's "today," as the 
indispensable, (super - ) essential nourishment of the feast of the 
coming Kingdom anticipated in the Eucharist. 

2862 The fifth petition begs God's mercy for our offences, mercy 
which can penetrate our hearts only if we have learned to forgive our 
enemies, with the example and help of Christ. 



2863 When we say "lead us not into temptation" we are asking God 
not to allow us to take the path that leads to sin. This petition implores 
the Spirit of discernment and strength; it requests the grace of 
vigilance and final perseverance. 

2864 In the last petition, "but deliver us from evil," Christians pray to 
God with the Church to show forth the victory, already won by Christ, 
over the "ruler of this world," Satan, the angel personally opposed to 
God and to his plan of salvation. 

2865 By the final "Amen," we express our "fiat" concerning the seven 
petitions: "So be it".
