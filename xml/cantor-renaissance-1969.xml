<p>The basis of a university education is an understanding of the great writings that have shaped Western civilization. The aim of this twelve- volume series is to make these doctrines of Western thought available to the student in the most convenient and readily comprehensible form. Each volume presents carefully selected texts by the two major thinkers of a particular historical period. In choosing the texts, the entire works of each thinker have been drawn upon, and passages from both familiar and unfamiliar writings are presented to bring the reader to an understanding of the central thought of the author. Following the selections are commentaries by leading modern scholars on the works studied. Many of these statements are drawn from books which are available only in the very bes^JjJicaiiefo^Again, these modern commen taries are carefully edited to present the main points as succinctly as possible. The first two chapters of each volume delineate the relevant historical context and biographical information and suggest the main outlines of the two thinkers' arguments, thus providing a framework udent's own analysis of the texts. The source texts are followed nderstandin back and ' uestions the stu analyze the texts again. These study guides will also serve as a basis for class discussion. The modern commentaries are similarly followed by study guides, requiring the student to consider the merits of the authors' critiques. !</p>

<p>We believe that the richness of the material selected and the peda gogical principles that have determined the organization of each volume will enable the student to carry away from his study a sophisticated understanding of the imperishable ideas the two great thinkers have propounded. The student who studies all twelve volumes will have an excellent basis for comprehending the fundamental thought of Western civilization.</p>

<div type='chapter' n='1'><head>The Historical Context</head>

<p>From the middle of the thirteenth century to the early years of the effectively came to an end after a century of intermittent warfarein which the papacy had given the communes valuable assistance in repelling northern domination; and until the French invasion of 1494, the Italian cities were left to work out their own destiny. Durin two and a half centuries the Italian cities were the scene of a great efflorescence in education, art, literature, and philosophy, which was inspired by the forms of classical art and thought. The intellectual leaders of this cultural expansion referred, therefore, to a "rebirth" of art and letters, and this era has ever since been known as the age of the Renaissance. In many ways the Renaissance built upon medieval learning and forms of thought, but modern scholars agree that a great turning point in theory, attitudes, and literary and artistic style oc curred in Northern Italy between 1250 and 1500 and that in several highly significant ways modern thought has its source in the Italian Renaissance.</p>

<p>The doctrines of the Renaissance thinkers immediately reflect the political, economic, and social conditions that prevailed in the Italian cities from 1250 to the early sixteenth century. The government of an Italian city was sovereign over the lives and interests of its subjects. The medieval feudal state was limited by the rights and privileges of various groups and classes and by a vague recognition that the state was subject to a moral law dictated by the church. The Renaissance state gave supreme and absolute power to the holder, or holders, of political authority, and no class or family could resist the civil law. The Italians came to believe that social order and the welfare of the community demanded that no special vested interest resist the sover eign political authority. This belief represents a great advance to po litical modernityto the idea and practice of sovereignty that underlies all modern state functioning. By the fifteenth century the feeling was also becoming widespread that the state could not recognize the sanctions of the church or even a moral consciousness as limitations to its authority. For better or worse, this amoral political doctrine has been characteristic of many, although not all, modern governments.</p>

<p>The state was central to the lives of Italians in the Renaissance period because it protected and fostered their extremely profitable capitalist economic interests. Since the tenth century the Italians had been the dominant group in the commercial life of Western Europe. The Italian cities had begun to grow wealthy in the tenth and eleventh centuries by acting as middlemen in the trade between the East (the Islamic world, Byzantium, and the Far East) and the rest of Western Europe. By the fourteenth century the northern merchants were chal lenging the Italian leadership in Mediterranean and Eastern trade, but until the sixteenth century Italian mercantile superiority was clearly maintained. In addition to their commercial enterprises, the Italian cities had invested heavily in industries, of which the most important was Florentine textile production, and great profits were also gained in this field. Finally, Italian economic activity had led to the development of banking institutions and to the techniques of finan cial capitalism. Again, until the end of the fifteenth century the Ital ians, particularly the Florentines, were the most sophisticated and most successful bankers and moneylenders in Europe, with the pope and several kings as their clients.</p>

<p>The capital gained from these vast enterprises enriched certain great families in every Italian city, and inevitably it was these families who dominated the government of the communes and took the lead in patronage of the arts and lettersindeed, they produced important writers and thinkers from among their own scions. For an understand ing of the Italian Renaissance, it is important to realize that these high bourgeoisie were a group who had advanced far beyond crude calculation and money-grubbing; they had become, in fact, a new aristocracy. The Italian capitalist families took over the refined style of life that had been developed by the French aristocracy of the thir teenth century and improved upon it. This style had decreed that social and political leadership depended not only upon wealth and birth but also upon nobility of mindeducation in the best literature, a rhetorical way of speaking, and refined manners. The Italian mer chant and banking families gave their sons (and sometimes their daughters as well) an intensive education in the Latin classics in order that the aristocratic style and temperament might be inculcated in the rising generation. The humanistic education begun by these families was to dominate the European school system until the twentieth century, and still has strong support today.</p>

<p>The products of this wealthy social background and this humanistic educational system saw themselves as the continuators, almost the rein carnation, of the great men of classical antiquity. The classical ideal of excellence became the Renaissance ideal of virt ; the best man was he who fulfilled all the potentialities of his being, who cultivated all the arts, and exercised political and military leadership as well. This ideal was also to have a long tradition in the Western world: it is the basis of the idea of the gentlemanthe true aristocrat who strives for refinement and excellence in all aspects of both intellectual and physical life.</p>

<p>The great achievement of the Renaissance was recognition of indi vidual as opposed to group values, of personality as opposed to collec tivity, and it was this new self-consciousness and recognition of indi vidual needs and possibilities that so sharply distinguished Renaissance from medieval culture.</p>

<p>However, it was precisely because of this individualism that the Re naissance communes finally failed to maintain their stability and inde pendence. The struggle for leadership and preferment among the great individuals that the high bourgeois families produced tore the Renaissance states apart. The political history of these societies is marked by constant factionalism, feuding, and ugly power struggles. By the fifteenth century many of the communes had abandoned gov ernment by a council of leading families and had surrendered power to a podest, a military dictator, who at least could provide domestic tranquillity. When the newly reorganized French monarchy invaded Italy in 1494, the Italian cities could not agree on a common program of alliance and defence, such as that which had repulsed the German emperor between 1150 and 1250. The French invasion was followed by the incursion of forces led by the Habsburg emperor of Spain and Germany, and Northern Italy by 1525 was the scene of a wide conflict between northern powers for the right to control the wealth and intel lectual resources of the communes.</p>

<p>The great age of Italian culture was over by 1525, but in the previous 250 years, the communes had inspired and fostered many of the most imperishable monuments of European art and literature. And the city of Florence had produced the two greatest Renaissance thinkers, Dante Alighieri and Niccolo Machiavelli, although the communal govern ment was ungenerous to both of its famous sons. Dante is the exponent of the early Renaissance thought that marks the transition from the church and group-centered medieval world to the state and individual- centered Renaissance culture. Machiavelli is the great theorist of the High (or full) Renaissance in which the potentialities of statism and humanism are carried to their ultimate conclusion and presented in forms that helped to shape modern European civilization.</p>

<p>Having treated the politics and society of the Renaissance from a very general point of view, we must now descend into the murky waters of Florentine affairs, for it was as political exiles from Florence that both Dante Alighieri and Niccolo Machiavelli viewed the world. Like all other communes, Florence was originally dominated by a patrician class known as magnates or grandi; these magnates justified their privi leges by serving as mounted knights in the communal army. In the thirteenth century this class was sharply divided between those who supported the Italian policy of the German emperor Frederick II and those who sided with the papacy; the former were called Ghibellines and the latter, Guelphs. The opposition between the two was so strong that, even after the death of Frederick II, the Guelph-Ghibelline feud continued to constitute the core of Italian, and particularly Flor entine, history for the next 50 years. On Frederick's death in 1250, the Guelph party seized control of the government. Within ten years the Ghibellines, rallying behind the cause of King Manfred, Frederick's illegitimate son, put an end to Guelph hegemony. When Pope Clement IV entered the struggle and excommunicated Manfred, he offered the crown of Sicily and Naples to Charles of Anjou, brother of the French king, and fortune once again favored the Guelphs. In 1267 the pope and Charles of Anjou succeeded in their common endeavor, and once again the Guelphs were back in power. To assure the continuance of their supremacy, the Guelphs proceeded to annihilate their Ghibelline opponents by driving them into exile, confiscating their houses and goods, and so impoverishing them that they never were able to recover.</p>

<p>In spite of the reactionary government, Florence entered a period of unprecedented prosperity. As Guelphs, the merchant-bankers of Florence secured a practical monopoly of the lucrative business of collecting papal revenue and acting as bankers for the papacy. The collection of papal revenue brought the Florentine merchant companies into contact with England and English wool, with the result that a great weaving industry grew up in Florence alongside the already established industry which finished cloth imported from the Nether lands and Northern France. The political significance of this economic prosperity was two-fold: first, it created a continuing supply of new and wealthy merchants eager to participate in the spoils of govern ment; second, it concentrated considerable power in the hands of the merchant and craft guilds.</p>

<p>In 1282 the seven leading merchant .guilds, whose members consti tuted the business elite of the town, joined forces with the five leading craft guilds and seized control of the government of Florence. To solidify their reign, they created a new executive office consisting of_ six priors, who were to be chosen from their own ranks. These priors served in office for two months and, during their incumbency, lived together in a private house as a single family. During the next ten years the government of the priors maintained a precarious existence, constantly threatened by the old, landed aristocracy which they had pushed aside. Finally, in 1293, the government of the priors, under the leadership ofjGienojdella Bella, promulgated the most famous and enduring act olLFiorentini constitutional history, the Ordinances of Justice. There were two separate parts to this act. The first part elaborated and strengthened the new guild government. The second part disenfranchised the older nobility by identifying active citizenship with membership in the guilds and by rendering ineligible for the office of priorate all families, any member of which had acquired the honor of knighthood within the past 20 years. A violent feud sprang up within the Guelph party between the Whites, who were moderate constitu- tionalists and favored acceptance of the Ordinance of Justice, and the reactionary Blacks. In 1302 the Blacks carried through an armed revolution with the aid of French troops sent by Pope Boniface VIII. A reign of terror followed in which hundreds of White Guelphs Dante among themwere condemned to death or exile.</p>

<p>Then when the German emperor Henry VII came down into Italy for a few months, exiled Whites, such as Dante, hoped that he would revive imperial ambitions to control Northern Italy, or at least inter vene in Florence so as to restore the Whites to their native city. But the German empire was only a shadow of its former power. Henry went quietly back to Germany, and Dante and his political colleagues were not allowed to return to Florence.</p>

<p>Unlike the other communes of Italy, Florence preserved its republi can constitution until the end of the Renaissance. But in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries behind the republican facade there always stood a small group of wealthy merchants who actually controlled the state. By the 1430's, power fell within the province of single individuals, the heads of the Medici family. Thus, like the other communes, Florence, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centiiries^ deyelooed into a terri torial state governed by a prince. Cosim^Medici,las head of the mer chant oligarchy, came to power in 1434 and for tne 30 years until his death controlled the government of Florence. Cosimo retained his control by two means; he supervised the random selection of all im portant officials, and, to meet special problems, he called extraordinary reforming assemblies to which only his followers were admitted as delegates. Another key to Cosimo's power was his own temperament. He was a very successful banker due to his cautious and conservative nature; he was wise enough to let others enjoy the spotlight of power; e preferred peace to war. Upon Cosimo's death, his eldest son, was set at the head of the oligarchy and, consequently, at the head of the government. Piero had Tills fulluUs banker's mentality and wisely followed his prudent policy. But chronic gout, the family cut short Piero's life; after only five years in power, his son, LorenzoAreplaced ag tl^ r&gt;l.ifraTvViy Lorenzo, educated as a gentleman, unfortunately lacked the caution and sobriety of his merchant forbears. In his hands, not only did the family's personal wealth decline, but he managed to squander the family fortune by embarking upon a number of reckless diplomatic schemes. Yet, by skill, the family reputation, and the good fortunes of history, JL^renzoVianaged to retain his power his Heath in 1492; within two yearSrhis son and heir, Piero, was driven out of Florence.</p>

<p>The hiatus in the long Medici control over Florentine government inaugurated a period of political upheaval and conflict that was exac erbated greatly by French and Spanish invasions. It was during this era of change and conflict that Machiavelli was a Florentine civil servant; he drew upon his experience of political life in the commune in developing his theories about the state.</p>

<head>An Introduction To The Life And Work Of Dante And Machiavelli</head>


<p>An Introduction to Dante</p>

<p>The Florentine political purge of 1302 marked a crucial point in the life of Dante Alighieri (1265-1321), for, like Machiavelli's, his life was divided into two parts: before his exile and after his exile. Dante was born in Florence in May, 1265. His family, it was thought, was de scended from the Roman founders of the city. A long family tree was probably their most notable achievement, for in Dante's time they be longed to the lesser nobility, were of rather modest means, and like most of the city's lesser nobility and artisans, were Guelph. Despite the family's modest social standing, Dante was able to pursue his studies and live the life of a gentleman. In 1289 he served the commune in the cavalry at the battle of Campaldino, which was the last important victory for the citizen army of Florence before the mercenary system took hold.</p>

<p>While still a young man, Dante began his career as a poet and com posed love poetry, as was the fashion of the day. Out of this period came his Vita Nuova, which, although ostensibly an autobiographical account of his love for a Florentine gentlewoman named Beatrice, is, in fact, a secular expression of the cult of the Virgin Mary. It was also in this period that Dante devoted considerable time to the study of the Latin poets, particularly Virgil, whom he acknowledged as the source of the "beautiful style" that made him famous, and to the study of philosophy, which he abandoned after three years, "having overtaxed his eyes with too much reading."</p>

<p>Dante did not devote his attention exclusively to poetry and philos ophy; as a young gentleman, he was also interested in the politics of Florence. Although the Ordinances ofJustice in 1293 effectively barred Dante's class from holding office, a mitigating constitutional provision in 1295 granted nobles of a certain rank the privilege of being elected to the councils of the people and to the priorate, if they registered in the rolls of the guilds. Thus, Dante joined the guild of physicians and apothecaries, and shortly thereafter served in the special council of the people. In 1300, Dante was elected to the priorate; although the two- month office provided little time for creating enduring enemies, it was an unfortunate moment to be in office, for the storm clouds of war were breaking over Florence. In 1302 Dante left Florence in exile, accused of graft, embezzlement, opposition to the pope, and disturbance of the peace of Florence.</p>

<p>Dante's two greatest works, De Monarchia and the Divine Comedy, were both written during his exile. The shock of expulsion from his native city and his bitterness and disappointment forced Dante to reconsider his views on the individual and society, and these two works exhibit a maturity and profundity that is lacking in his early lyric poetry. In his early poetry, written in Florence, Dante perpetuates the romantic motifs of twelfth- and thirteenth-century French literature. In his twc later works (the Divine Comedy is an epic poem in the Italian vernacular; De Monarchia is a Latin prose treatise) Dante establishes a consistent and comprehensive view of social and personal values.</p>

<p>The Divine Comedy is in outlinebut only in outlinea summation of the medieval world view and is heavily indebted to the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas. The Roman poet Virgil, symbolizing reason and classical humanism, leads Dante through hell to the entrance to purgatory; Dante, like Thomas, is saying that reason can show us how to achieve a life that meets minimal moral standards. Beatrice, repre senting the beatific vision of the church, leads the poet through purga tory and the lower levels of heaven; this is as much as the church can provide. It is St. Bernard, representing the mystical experience, who guides Dante through the higher circles of heaven. If the structure of the Divine Comedy is a summation of the medieval ethos, there are sev eral doctrines in it that signal a break with the traditional teachings of the church. Siger of Brabant, the radical disciple of the Arab philos opher Averroes and the antagonist of Thomas Aquinas at the University of Paris, is placed in heaven. In De Monarchia Dante indicates his sym pathy with the heretical Averroist doctrine of collective, as opposed to individual, immortality. Pope Boniface VIII, Dante's contemporary and the spokesman for papal supremacy over the state, is placed in hell. The Donation of Constantine, the forged document of the eighth century that gave the pope claims to secular rule in Italy, is bitterly regretted by Dante. Above all, what is radical in the Divine Comedy is the theme of personal search for salvation, of personal quest for ful fillment. The church helps in this quest, but reason and individual feelings are also indispensable. It is the personal search for value and meaning, and not obedience to external ecclesiastic authority, that gives life its purpose and dignity; this is Dante's basic theme. And this idea was to become the prime motif of Renaissance thought.</p>

<p>The organization and style of the Divine Comedy are as complex as the theme. Dante, like so many of his age, believed that numbers had a special, divine meaning; three and ten were the most important, the former symbolizing the Trinity, and the latter, perfection. Thus, the Comedy is divided into three canticles, each dealing with an other worldly realmInferno, Purgatory, and Paradise; each canticle has 30 cantos, with one canto as an introduction to the entire poemtotaling exactly ten times ten, or 100. Even the rhyme scheme operates on the principle of three; furthermore, the Inferno, a vast abyss in the center of the earth, is divided into nine circles, plus the vestibule; there are as many divisions in Purgatory, a high mountain which rises from the ocean in the southern hemisphere; and Paradise has nine heavens plus the empyrean.</p>

<p>The De Monarchia, being a didactic work, is more blatantly radical than the Divine Comedy. Dante removes from the church its control over the state, and gives to secular political authority the ultimate sanction in society. This view, too, inaugurates a prime theme in Renaissance thought. Dante came to this view partly because of his unhappy personal experience. While in exile Dante altered his political views; convinced that the evils of Italian politics were attributable to the church's meddling in temporal affairs and to the lack of a supreme secular ruler, Dante became a champion of the German imperial cause. He saw the possibility of his vision becoming a reality when it appeared that Henry VII of Germany was planning an invasion of Italy. In a letter Dante wrote: "Rejoice, sorrowful Italy, for thy bride groom hastens to the marriage, and you that weep oppressed, lift up your hearts, because your salvation is nigh, and all of you, Italians, rise to meet your king, ..." Thus, De Monarchia was intended as a theoretical defense of Henry VII's conquest of Italy.</p>

<p>The imperial conquest never occurred; Dante's expectations were again grimly frustrated. Insofar as the De Monarchia was intended to justify Henry VII's conquest of Florence, the treatise rapidly became obsolete and pointless. But Dante had ranged much further in his argument than the needs of the current political situation. He ex amined the general principles of political life, and he justified the sov ereign authority of the emperor partly on grounds of social need: only the authority of state could provide peace and order. This view became central to the political vision of the Renaissance and the dominant assumption in all modern political thinking.</p>



<p>An Introduction to Machiavelli</p>

<p>Lorenzo Medici's son, Piero, was driven from Florence by the terrible saint, Savonarola, who preached against moral laxity and the decay of religion, moving the people to overthrow their masters. Within six years the pope had Savonarola burned at the stake, and Florence set about reorganizing its republic. Named as second chancellor was Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527), a young man with no reputation and very little experience, but with a brilliant intellect. Machiavelli was to spend 14 years as second chancellor and special envoy, at the end of which time he was exiled from the government. Like Dante, Machiavelli composed his greatest works after his exile. Today Machia velli is remembered for his observations on political life; but to his contemporaries he was also known for his enjoyment of life, particu larly of political discourse and of women. He was of medium height, thin, and bold in his bearing; his hair was black and his skin pale; his most outstanding feature was an ironical smile which always seemed to hover on his lips. From his father he acquired a love of books, and he was a close student of the Latin classics; the two pillars of Machiavelli's thought were his knowledge of Roman history and his experience as second chancellor.</p>

<p>The second chancery was not a very important place, although it did have a redeeming virtue: it was one of the few places where a Florentine could follow the day-to-day political fortunes of Italy. It was in his special commissions that Machiavelli acquired his knowledge of politics. The first few years of the sixteenth century were decisive years for Italy; both France and Spain were preparing to invade Italy, and Cesare Borgia, the bastard son of Pope Alexander VI, was waging war in the papal states. Florence was in the center of the storm. There were alliances to be made and to be broken, and a course of action to be planned. Machiavelli had earned a reputation for his clear and concise reports and uncanny appraisals of complex situations. Therefore, he was sent from court to court in order to observe and assess the situation and advise Florence. All this came to an end in 1511, when the Spanish army, acting in consort with the pope, defeated Florence. The condi tion of surrender was that the Medici should be restored to Florence. Once the government was reorganized there was no longer a need for the republican secretary, Machiavelli, and he was dismissed from office. But, this was only the beginning of his troubles. Not only did the pro- Medici government dismiss him, but they sought blame, punishment, and revenge.</p>

<p>Banished from government, and self-exiled in a country home, Machiavelli, who had been accustomed to moving in courts of princes and pondering the affairs of state, settled down to his new life:</p>

<p>I rise in the morning with the sun, and I go off to a wood of mine which I am having cut down, where I stop for two hours to see what was done the day before and to talk to the woodcutters who always have some trouble on hand either among themselves or with their neighbours. . . . Leaving the wood I go to a spring and thence to some bird-traps of mine. I have a book with me, Dante or Petrarch or one of the minor poets, Tibullus, Ovid or the like. I read about their amorous passions and their loves, I remember my own, and dwell enjoyably on these thoughts for a while. Then I go on to the road and into the tavern. I talk to the passers- by, I ask what news of their villages, I hear all sorts of things, and observe the various tastes and ideas of men. In the meanwhile it is time for dinner, and with my folk I eat what food this poor farm and miserable patrimony of mine provides. When I have eaten I go back to the tavern. Here I find the host, and usually a butcher, a miller, and a couple of kiln-men. With them I degrade myself all day at cricca and tric-trac, and this gives rise to a thousand arguments and endless vexations with insulting words, and most times there is a fight over a penny, and we can be heard shout ing from as far away as San Casciano. And so, surrounded by these lice, I blow the cobwebs out of my brain and relieve the unkindness of my fate, content that she trample on me in this way to see if she is not ashamed to treat me thus.</p>

<p>When evening comes I return home and go into my study, and at the door I take off my daytime dress covered in mud and dirt, and put on royal and curial robes; and then decently attired I enter the courts of the ancients, where affectionately greeted by them, I partake of that food which is mine alone and for which I was born; where I am not ashamed to talk with them and inquire the reasons of their actions; and they out of human kindness answer me, and for four hours at a stretch I feel no worry of any kind; I forget all my troubles, I am not afraid of poverty or of death. I give myself up entirely to them. And because Dante says that under standing does not constitute knowledge unless it is retained in the mem ory, I have written down what I have learned from their conversation and composed a short work de Principatibus. . ..</p>

<p>It was in the early years of his exile, under these conditions and in this mood, that Machiavelli wrote the Prince. Machiavelli had high hopes for his Prince: if only presented to the right patron, he thought it might gain a position in government for him. The key to Florentine government was through the Medici, and Machiavelli tried dedicating his work to one member of the family after another, writing about each as if he alone were the true prince. Machiavelli's plan failed; but throughout the rest of his life he continued to seek reentry into Floren tine government; but when at last the Medici offered him a commission, it was not to enter government but to write a history of Florence.</p>

<p>Machiavelli never regained his political office. But The Prince and another and much more elaborate treatise written during his exile, The Discourses (designed as a commentary on the work of the Roman historian Livy), taken together with his History of Florence and some more strictly belletristic works, have gained for him the position as the lead ing social and historical thinker of the Italian Renaissance and the founder of modern political theory.</p>

<p>Machiavelli was first and foremost what he professed to be: a classical humanist. He was an idealistic republican who wanted statesmen to work for the welfare of society. But his experience in Florentine politics, the lessons he learned as ambassador to the court of the crafty French king, his observation of the career of Cesare Borgiathe most dramatic political leader of the dayand his close study of Roman history con vinced Machiavelli that the high moral ideals that men profess are often ignored and, in fact, betrayed in day-to-day political action. He therefore set out to establish the realities of power politics and to pre scribe how ambitious men actually obtain and retain power in the state. To the end of his life, however, Machiavelli never abandoned his hopes for a better political order, and he envisioned the coming of a great leader who would save Italy from foreign invaders and unite the Italian cities in a national state that would serve the commonweal.</p>

<p>As an historian, Machiavelli followed the lines of interpretation set down by the Greco-Roman historians. He believed in a cyclic view of political developmentin the degeneration, reconstruction, and then further degeneration of governments. He made the focus of his history the deeds of great men, and for him the dimension and subject of history was the rise and fall of political authority. These were to remain the motifs of historical literature until the nineteenth century, and they are still the most common themes in historical writing. Machiavelli was, therefore, the founder of modern historiography as well as of modern political science.</p>

<div type='chapter' n='3'><head>Selections From Dante's Work</head><p>


being an account of Dante's journey through hell, purgatory,
and paradise, the Divine Comedy is an allegory of sin and salvation, a
political treatise concerning Florentine politics and European church-state
relations, a handbook for the aristocratic ethos of courtly love, and, not least,
a poem of exquisite literary and artistic beauty. The following selections,
which present the essential intellectual and stylistic features of the Inferno,
Purgatory, and Paradise, should be read on these multiple levels.</p>

<p>CANTO 1</p>



<lg><l>Midway in our life's journey, I went astray</l>
<l>from the straight road and woke to find myself</l>
<l>alone in a dark wood. How shall I say</l></lg>

<lg><l>what wood that was ! I never saw so drear,</l>
<l>so rank, so arduous a wilderness !</l>
<l>Its very memory gives a shape to fear.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Death could scarce be more bitter than that place !</l>
<l>But since it came to good, I will recount</l>
<l>all that I found revealed there by God's grace.</l></lg>

<lg><l>How I came to it I cannot rightly say,</l>
<l>so drugged and loose with sleep had I become</l>
<l>when I first wandered there from the True Way.</l></lg>

<l>already with the sweet rays of that planet</l>
<l>whose virtue leads men straight on every road,</l></lg>

<lg><l>and the shining strengthened me against the fright</l>
<l>whose agony had wracked the lake of my heart</l>
<l>through all the terrors of that piteous night.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Just as a swimmer, who with his last breath</l>
<l>flounders ashore from perilous seas, might turn</l>
<l>to memorize the wide water of his death</l></lg>

<lg><l>so did I turn, my soul still fugitive</l>
<l>from death's surviving image, to stare down</l>
<l>that pass that none had ever left alive.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And there I lay to rest from my heart's race</l>
<l>till calm and breath returned to me. Then rose</l>
<l>and pushed up that dead slope at such a pace</l></lg>

<lg><l>each footfall rose above the last. And lo !</l>
<l>almost at the beginning of the rise</l>
<l>I faced a spotted Leopard, all tremor and flow</l></lg>

<lg><l>and gaudy pelt. And it would not pass, but stood</l>
<l>so blocking my every turn that time and again</l>
<l>I was on the verge of turning back to the wood.</l></lg>

<lg><l>This fell at the first widening of the dawn</l>
<l>as the sun was climbing Aries with those stars</l>
<l>that rode with him to light the new creation.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Thus the holy hour and the sweet season</l>
<l>of commemoration did much to arm my fear</l>
<l>of that bright murderous beast with their good omen.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Yet not so much but what I shook with dread</l>
<l>at sight of a great Lion that broke upon me</l>
<l>raging with hunger, its enormous head</l></lg>

<p>INFERNO 15</p>



<lg><l>held high as if to strike a mortal terror</l>
<l>into the very air. And down his track,</l>
<l>a She-Wolf drove upon me, a starved horror</l></lg>

<lg><l>ravening and wasted beyond all belief.</l>
<l>She seemed a rack for avarice, gaunt and craving.</l>
<l>Oh many the souls she has brought to endless grief!</l></lg>

<lg><l>She brought such heaviness upon my spirit</l>
<l>at sight of her savagery and desperation,</l>
<l>I died from every hope of that high summit.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And like a misereager in acquisition</l>
<l>but desperate in self-reproach when Fortune's wheel</l>
<l>turns to the hour of his lossall tears and attrition</l></lg>

<lg><l>I wavered back; and still the beast pursued,</l>
<l>forcing herself against me bit by bit</l>
<l>till I slid back into the sunless wood.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And as I fell to my soul's ruin, a presence</l>
<l>gathered before me on the discolored air,</l>
<l>the figure of one who seemed hoarse from long silence.</l></lg>

<lg><l>At sight of him in that friendless waste I cried:</l>
<l>"Have pity on me, whatever thing you are,</l>
<l>whether shade or living man." And it replied:</l></lg>

<lg><l>"Not man, though man I once was, and my blood</l>
<l>was Lombard, both my parents Mantuan.</l>
<l>I was born, though late, sub Julio, and bred</l></lg>

<lg><l>in Rome under Augustus in the noon</l>
<l>of the false and lying gods. I was a poet</l>
<l>and sang of old Anchises' noble son</l></lg>

<lg><l>who came to Rome after the burning of Troy.</l>
<l>But youwhy do you return to these distresses</l>
<l>instead of climbing that shining Mount of Joy</l></lg>

<lg><l>which is the seat and first cause of man's bliss?"</l>
<l>"And are you then that Virgil and that fountain</l>
<l>of purest speech?" My voice grew tremulous:</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"Glory and light of poets! now may that zeal</l>
<l>and love's apprenticeship that I poured out</l>
<l>on your heroic verses serve me well !</l></lg>

<lg><l>For you are my true master and first author,</l>
<l>the sole maker from whom I drew the breath</l>
<l>of that sweet style whose measures have brought me honor.</l></lg>

<lg><l>See there, immortal sage, the beast I flee.</l>
<l>For my soul's salvation, I beg you, guard me from her,</l>
<l>for she has struck a mortal tremor through me."</l></lg>

<lg><l>And he replied, seeing my soul in tears:</l>
<l>"He must go by another way who would escape</l>
<l>this wilderness, for that mad beast that fleers</l></lg>

<lg><l>before you there, suffers no man to pass.</l>
<l>She tracks down all, kills all, and knows no glut,</l>
<l>but, feeding, she grows hungrier than she was.</l></lg>

<lg><l>She mates with any beast, and will mate with more</l>
<l>before the Greyhound comes to hunt her down.</l>
<l>He will not feed on lands nor loot, but honor</l></lg>

<lg><l>and love and wisdom will make straight his way.</l>
<l>He will rise between Feltro and Feltro, and in him</l>
<l>shall be the resurrection and new day</l></lg>

<lg><l>of that sad Italy for which Nisus died,</l>
<l>and Turnus, and Euryalus, and the maid Camilla.</l>
<l>He shall hunt her through every nation of sick pride</l></lg>

<lg><l>till she is driven back forever to Hell</l>
<l>whence Envy first released her on the world.</l>
<l>Therefore, for your own good, I think it well</l></lg>






<lg><l>you follow me and I will be your guide</l>
<l>and lead you forth through an eternal place.</l>
<l>There you shall see the ancient spirits tried</l></lg>

<lg><l>in endless pain, and hear their lamentation</l>
<l>as each bemoans the second death of souls.</l>
<l>Next you shall see upon a burning mountain</l></lg>








<p>INFERNO 17</p>


<p>


souls in fire and yet content in fire,
knowing that whensoever it may be
they yet will mount into the blessed choir.

To which, if it is still your wish to climb,
a worthier spirit shall be sent to gyide you.
With her shall I leave you, for the King of Time,

who reigns on high, forbids me to come there
since, living, I rebelled against his law.
He rules the waters and the land and air

and there holds court, his city and his throne.
Oh blessed are they he chooses!" And I to him:
"Poet, by that God to you unknown,

lead me this way. Beyond this present ill
and worse to dread, lead me to Peter's gate
and be my guide through the sad halls of Hell."

And he then: "Follow." And he moved ahead
in silence, and I followed where he led.

CANTO 2

The light was departing. The brown air drew down
all the earth's creatures, calling them to rest
from their day-roving, as I, one man alone,

prepared myself to face the double war
of the journey and the pity, which memory
shall here set down, nor hesitate, nor err.

O Muses ! O High Genius ! Be my aid !
O Memory, recorder of the vision,
here shall your true nobility be displayed !

Thus I began: "Poet, you who must guide me,
before you trust me to that arduous passage,
look to me and look through mecan I be worthy?

You sang how the father of Sylvius, while still
in corruptible flesh won to that other world,
crossing with mortal sense the immortal sill.


But if the Adversary of all Evil
weighing his consequence and who and what
should issue from him, treated him so well

that cannot seem unfitting to thinking men,
since he was chosen father of Mother Rome
and of her Empire by God's will and token.

Both, to speak strictly, were founded and foreknown
as the established Seat of Holiness
for the successors of Great Peter's throne.

In that quest, which your verses celebrate,
he learned those mysteries from which arose
his victory and Rome's apostolate.

There later came the chosen vessel, Paul,
bearing the confirmation of that Faith
which is the one true door to life eternal.

But Ihow should I dare? By whose permission?
I am not Aeneas. I am not Paul.
Who could believe me worthy of the vision?

How, then, may I presume to this high quest
and not fear my own brashness? You are wise
and will grasp what my poor words can but suggest."

As one who unwills what he wills, will stay
strong purposes with feeble second thoughts
until he spells all his first zeal away

so I hung back and balked on that dim coast
till thinking had worn out my enterprise,
so stout at starting and so early lost.

"I understand from your words and the look in your eyes,"
that shadow of magnificence answered me,
"your soul is sunken in that cowardice

that bears down many men, turning their course
and resolution by imagined perils,
as his own shadow turns the frightened horse.



INFERNO 19

To free you of this dread I will tell you all
of why I came to you and what I heard
when first I pitied you. I was a soul

among the souls of Limbo, when a Lady
so blessed and so beautiful, I prayed her
to order and command my will, called to me.

Her eyes were kindled from the lamps of Heaven.
Her voice reached through me, tender, sweet, and low.
An angel's voice, a music of its own:

'O gracious Mantuan whose melodies
live in earth's memory and shall live on
till the last motion ceases in the skies,

my dearest friend, and fortune's foe, has strayed
onto a friendless shore and stands beset

by such distresses that he turns afraid

from the True Way, and news of him in Heaven
rumors my dread he is already lost.
I come, afraid that I am too-late risen.

Fly to him and with your high counsel, pity,
and with whatever need be for his good
and soul's salvation, help him, and solace me.

It is I, Beatrice, who send you to him.
I come from the blessed height for which I yearn.
Love called me here. When amid Seraphim

I stand again before my Lord, your praises
shall sound in Heaven.' She paused, and I began:
'O Lady of that only grace that raises

feeble mankind within its mortal cycle
above all other works God's will has placed
within the heaven of the smallest circle;

so welcome is your command that to my sense,
were it already fulfilled, it would yet seem tardy.
I understand, and am all obedience.


But tell me how you dare to venture thus
so far from the wide heaven of your joy
to which your thoughts yearn back from this abyss.'

'Since what you ask,' she answered me, 'probes near
the root of all, I will say briefly only
how I have come through Hell's pit without fear.

Know then, O waiting and compassionate soul,
that is to fear which has the power to harm,
and nothing else is fearful even in Hell.

I am so made by God's all-seeing mercy
your anguish does not touch me, and the flame
of this great burning has no power upon me.

There is a Lady in Heaven so concerned
for him I send you to, that for her sake
the strict decree is broken. She has turned

and called Lucia to her wish and mercy
saying: 'Thy faithful one is sorely pressed;
in his distresses I commend him to thee.'

Lucia, that soul of light and foe of all
cruelty, rose and came to me at once
where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel,

saying to me: 'Beatrice, true praise of God,
why dost thou not help him who loved thee so
that for thy sake he left the vulgar crowd?


Dost thou not hear his cries? Canst thou not see
the death he wrestles with beside that river
no ocean can surpass for rage and fury?

No soul of earth was ever as rapt to seek
its good or flee its injury as I was
when I had heard my sweet Lucia speak

to descend from Heaven and my blessed seat
to you, laying my trust in that high speech
that honors you and all who honor it.'



INFERNO 21

She spoke and turned away to hide a tear
that, shining, urged me faster. So I came
and freed you from the beast that drove you there,

blocking the near way to the Heavenly Height.
And now what ails you? Why do you lag? Why
this heartsick hesitation and pale fright

when three such blessed Ladies lean from Heaven
in their concern for you and my own pledge
of the great good that waits you has been given?"

As flowerlets drooped and puckered in the night
turn up to the returning sun and spread
their petals wide on his new warmth and light

just so my wilted spirits rose again
and such a heat of zeal surged through my veins
that I was born anew. Thus I began:

"Blessd be that Lady of infinite pity,
and blessd be thy taxed and courteous spirit
that came so promptly on the word she gave thee.

Thy words have moved my heart to its first purpose.
My Guide! My Lord! My Master! Now lead on:
one will shall serve the two of us in this."

He turned when I had spoken, and at his back
I entered on that hard and perilous track.

CANTO 3

I AM THE WAY INTO THE CITY OF WOE.

I AM THE WAY TO A FORSAKEN PEOPLE.

I AM THE WAY INTO ETERNAL SORROW.

SACRED JUSTICE MOVED MY ARCHITECT.
I WAS RAISED HERE BY DIVINE OMNIPOTENCE,
PRIMORDIAL LOVE AND ULTIMATE INTELLECT.

ONLY THOSE ELEMENTS TIME CANNOT WEAR

WERE MADE BEFORE ME, AND BEYOND TIME I STAND.
ABANDON ALL HOPE YE WHO ENTER HERE.


These mysteries I read cut into stone
above a gate. And turning I said: "Master,
what is the meaning of this harsh inscription?"

And he then as initiate to novice:
"Here must you put by all division of spirit
and gather your soul against all cowardice.

This is the place I told you to expect.
Here you shall pass among the fallen people,
souls who have lost the good of intellect."

So saying, he put forth his hand to me,
and with a gentle and encouraging smile
he led me through the gate of mystery.

Here sighs and cries and wails coiled and recoiled
on the starless air, spilling my soul to tears.
A confusion of tongues and monstrous accents toiled

in pain and anger. Voices hoarse and shrill
and sounds of blows, all intermingled, raised
tumult and pandemonium that still

whirls on the air forever dirty with it
as if a whirlwind sucked at sand. . . .

CANTO 19

O Simon Magus ! O you wretched crew
who follow him, pandering for silver and gold
the things of God which should be wedded to

love and righteousness ! O thieves for hire,
now must the trump of judgment sound your doom
here in the third fosse of the rim of fire !

We had already made our way across
to the next grave, and to that part of the bridge
which hangs above the mid-point of the fosse.

O Sovereign Wisdom, how Thine art doth shine
in Heaven, on Earth, and in the Evil World!
How justly doth Thy power judge and assign!



INFERNO 23

I saw along the walls and on the ground
long rows of holes cut in the livid stone;
all were cut to a size, and all were round.

They seemed to be exactly the same size
as those in the font of my beautiful San Giovanni,
built to protect the priests who come to baptize;

(one of which, not so long since, I broke open
to rescue a boy who was wedged and drowning in it.
Be this enough to undeceive all men.)

From every mouth a sinner's legs stuck out
as far as the calf. The soles were all ablaze
and the joints of the legs quivered and writhed about.

Withes and tethers would have snapped in their throes.
As oiled things blaze upon the surface only,
so did they burn from the heels to the points of their toes.

"Master," I said, "who is that one in the fire
who writhes and quivers more than all the others?
From him the ruddy flames seem to leap higher."

And he to me: "If you wish me to carry you down
along that lower bank, you may learn from him
who he is, and the evil he has done."

And I: "What you will, I will. You are my lord
and know I depart in nothing from you wish;
and you know my mind beyond my spoken word."

We moved to the fourth ridge, and turning left
my Guide descended by a jagged path
into the strait and perforated cleft.

Thus the good Master bore me down the dim
and rocky slope, and did not put me down
till we reached the one whose legs did penance for him.

"Whoever you are, sad spirit," I began,
"who lie here with your head below your heels
and planted like a stakespeak if you can."


I stood like a friar who gives the sacrament
to a hired assassin, who, fixed in the hole,
recalls him, and delays his death a moment.

"Are you there already, Boniface? Are you there
already?" he cried. "By several years the writ
has lied. And all that gold, and all that care

are you already sated with the treasure
for which you dared to turn on the Sweet Lady
and trick and pluck and bleed her at your pleasure?"

I stood like one caught in some raillery,
not understanding what is said to him,
lost for an answer to such mockery.

Then Virgil said: "Say to him: {I am not he,
I am not who you think.' " And I replied
as my good Master had instructed me.

The sinner's feet jerked madly; then again
his voice rose, this time choked with sighs and tears,
and said at last: "What do you want of me then?

If to know who I am drives you so fearfully
that you descend the bank to ask it, know
that the Great Mantle was once hung upon me.

And in truth I was a son of the She-Bear,
so sly and eager to push my whelps ahead,
that I pursed wealth above, and myself here.

Beneath my head are dragged all who have gone
before me in buying and selling holy office;
there they cower in fissures of the stone.

I too shall be plunged down when that great cheat
for whom I took you comes here in his turn.
Longer already have I baked my feet

and been planted upside-down, than he shall be
before the west sends down a lawless Shepherd
of uglier deeds to cover him and me.



INFERNO 25

He will be a new Jason of the Maccabees;
and just as that king bent to his high priests' will,
so shall the French king do as this one please."

MaybeI cannot sayI grew too brash
at this point, for when he had finished speaking
I said: "Indeed! Now tell me how much cash

our Lord required of Peter in guarantee
before he put the keys into his keeping?
Surely he asked nothing but 'Follow me!'

Nor did Peter, nor the others, ask silver or gold
of Matthew when they chose him for the place
the despicable and damned apostle sold.

Therefore stay as you are; this hole well fits you
and keep a good guard on the ill-won wealth
that once made you so bold toward Charles of Anjou.

And were it not that I am still constrained

by the reverence I owe to the Great Keys
you held in life, I should not have refrained

from using other words and sharper still;
for this avarice of yours grieves all the world,
tramples the virtuous, and exalts the evil.

Of such as you was the Evangelist's vision
when he saw She who Sits upon the Waters
locked with the Kings of earth in fornication.

She was born with seven heads, and ten enormous
and shining horns strengthened and made her glad
as long as love and virtue pleased her spouse.

Gold and silver are the gods you adore !
In what are you different from the idolator,
save that he worships one, and you a score?

Ah Constantine, what evil marked the hour
not of your conversion, but of the fee
the first rich Father took from you in dower!"


And as I sang him this tune, he began to twitch
and kick both feet out wildly, as if in rage
or gnawed by consciencelittle matter which.

And I think, indeed, it pleased my Guide: his look
was all approval as he stood beside me
intent upon each word of truth I spoke.

He approached, and with both arms he lifted me,
and when he had gathered me against his breast,
remounted the rocky path out of the valley,

nor did he tire of holding me clasped to him,
until we reached the topmost point of the arch
which crosses from the fourth to the fifth rim

of the pits of woe. Arrived upon the bridge,
he tenderly set down the heavy burden
he had been pleased to carry up that ledge

which would have been hard climbing for a goat.
Here I looked down on still another moat.

CANTO 28

Who could describe, even in words set free
of metric and rhyme and a thousand times retold,
the blood and wounds that now were shown to me!

At grief so deep the tongue must wag in vain;
the language of our sense and memory
lacks the vocabulary of such pain.

If one could gather all those who have stood
through all of time on Puglia's fateful soil
and wept for the red running of their blood

in the war of the Trojans; and in that long war
which left so vast a spoil of golden rings,
as we find written in Livy, who does not err;

along with those whose bodies felt the wet
and gaping wounds of Robert Guiscard's lances;
with all the rest whose bones are gathered yet



INFERNO 27

at Ceperano where every last Pugliese
turned traitor; and with those from Tagliacozzo
where Alardo won without weaponsif all these

were gathered, and one showed his limbs run through,
another his lopped off, that could not equal
the mutilations of the ninth pit's crew.

A wine tun when a stave or cant-bar starts
does not split open as wide as one I saw
split from his chin to the mouth with which man farts.

Between his legs all of his red guts hung
with the heart, the lungs, the liver, the gall bladder,
and the shriveled sac that passes shit to the bung.

I stood and stared at him from the stone shelf;
he noticed me and opening his own breast
with both hands cried: "See how I rip myself!

See how Mahomet's mangled and split open!
Ahead of me walks Ali in his tears,
his head cleft from the top-knot to the chin.

And all the other souls that bleed and mourn

along this ditch were sowers of scandal and schism:
as they tore others apart, so are they torn.

Behind us, warden of our mangled horde,
the devil who butchers us and sends us marching
waits to renew our wounds with his long sword

when we have made the circuit of the pit;
for by the time we stand again before him
all the wounds he gave us last have knit.

But who are you that gawk down from that sill
probably to put off your own descent
to the pit you are sentenced to for your own evil?"

"Death has not come for him, guilt does not drive
his soul to torment," my sweet Guide replied.
"That he may experience all while yet alive


I, who am dead, must lead him through the drear
and darkened halls of Hell, from round to round :
and this is true as my own standing here."

More than a hundred wraiths who were marching under
the sill on which we stood, paused at his words
and stared at me, forgetting pain in wonder.

"And if you do indeed return to see
the sun again, and soon, tell Fra Dolcino
unless he longs to come and march with me

he would do well to check his groceries
before the winter drives him from the hills
and gives the victory to the Novarese."

Mahomet, one foot raised, had paused to say
these words to me. When he had finished speaking
he stretched it out and down, and moved away.

Anotherhe had his throat slit, and his nose
slashed off as far as the eyebrows, and a wound
where one of his ears had beenstanding with those

who stared at me in wonder from the pit,
opened the grinning wound of his red gullet
as if it were a mouth, and said through it:

"O soul unforfeited to misery
and whomunless I take you for another
I have seen above in our sweet Italy;

if ever again you see the gentle plain
that slopes down from Vercelli to Marcab,
remember Pier da Medicina in pain,

and announce this warning to the noblest two
of Fano, Messers Guido and Angiolello:
that unless our foresight sees what is not true

they shall be thrown from their ships into the sea
and drown in the raging tides near La Cattolica
to satisfy a tyrant's treachery.



INFERNO 29

Neptune never saw so gross a crime
in all the seas from Cyprus to Majorca,
not even in pirate raids, nor the Argive time.

The one-eyed traitor, lord of the demesne
whose hill and streams one who walks here beside me
will wish eternally he had never seen,

will call them to a parley, but behind
sweet invitations he will work it so

they need not pray against Focara's wind."

And I to him: "If you would have me bear
your name to time, show me the one who found
the sight of that land so harsh, and let me hear

his story and his name." He touched the cheek
of one nearby, forcing the jaws apart,
and said: "This is the one; he cannot speak.

This outcast settled Caesar's doubts that day
beside the Rubicon by telling him:
4A man prepared is a man hurt by delay.' "

Ah, how wretched Curio seemed to me
with a bloody stump in his throat in place of the tongue
which once had dared to speak so recklessly !

And one among them with both arms hacked through
cried out, raising his stumps on the foul air
while the blood bedaubed his face: "Remember, too,

Mosca dei Lamberti, alas, who said
'A thing done has an end !' and with those words
planted the fields of war with Tuscan dead."

"And brought about the death of all your clan!"
I said, and he, stung by new pain on pain,
ran off; and in his grief he seemed a madman.

I stayed to watch those broken instruments,
and I saw a thing so strange I should not dare
to mention it without more evidence


but that my own clear conscience strengthens me,
that good companion that upholds a man
within the armor of his purity.

I saw it there; I seem to see it still
a body without a head, that moved along
like all the others in that spew and spill.

It held the severed head by its own hair,
swinging it like a lantern in its hand;
and the head looked at us and wept in its despair.

It made itself a lamp of its own head,
and they were two in one and one in two;
how this can be, He knows who so commanded.

And when it stood directly under us
it raised the head at arm's length toward our bridge
the better to be heard, and swaying thus

it cried: "O living soul in this abyss,
see what a sentence has been passed upon me,
and search all Hell for one to equal this !

When you return to the world, remember me:
I am Bertrand de Born, and it was I
who set the young king on to mutiny,

son against father, father against son
as Achitophel set Absalom and David;
and since I parted those who should be one

in duty and in love, I bear my brain
divided from its source within this trunk;
and walk here where my evil turns to pain,

an eye for an eye to all eternity:
thus is the law of Hell observed in me."

CANTO 32

If I had rhymes as harsh and horrible
as the hard fact of that final dismal hole
which bears the weight of all the steeps of Hell,



INFERNO 31

I might more fully press the sap and substance
from my conception; but since I must do
without them, I begin with some reluctance.

For it is no easy undertaking, I say,
to describe the bottom of the Universe;
nor is it for tongues that only babble child's play.

But may those Ladies of the Heavenly Spring
who helped Amphion wall Thebes, assist my verse,
that the word may be the mirror of the thing.

0 most miscreant rabble, you who keep
the stations of that place whose name is pain,
better had you been born as goats or sheep !

We stood now in the dark pit of the well,
far down the slope below the Giant's feet,
and while I still stared up at the great wall,

1 heard a voice cry: "Watch which way you turn:
take care you do not trample on the heads
of the forworn and miserable brethren."

Whereat I turned and saw beneath my feet
and stretching out ahead, a lake so frozen
it seemed to be made of glass. So thick a sheet

never yet hid the Danube's winter course,
nor, far away beneath the frigid sky,
locked the Don up in its frozen source:

for were Tanbernick and the enormous peak
of Pietrapana to crash down on it,
not even the edges would so much as creak.

The way frogs sit to croak, their muzzles leaning
out of the water, at the time and season
when the peasant woman dreams of her day's gleaning

Just so the livid dead are sealed in place
up to the part at which they blushed for shame,
and they beat their teeth like storks. Each holds his face


bowed toward the ice, each of them testifies
to the cold with his chattering mouth, to his heart's grief
with tears that flood forever from his eyes.

When I had stared about me, I looked down
and at my feet I saw two clamped together
so tightly that the hair of their heads had grown

together. "Who are you," I said, "who lie
so tightly breast to breast?" They strained their necks,
and when they had raised their heads as if to reply,

the tears their eyes had managed to contain
up to that time gushed out, and the cold froze them
between the lids, sealing them shut again

tighter than any clamp grips wood to wood,
and mad with pain, they fell to butting heads
like billy-goats in a sudden savage mood.

And a wraith who lay to one side and below,
and who had lost both ears to frostbite, said,
his head still bowed: "Why do you watch us so?

If you wish to know who they are who share one doom,
they owned the Bisenzio's valley with their father,
whose name was Albert. They sprang from one womb,

and you may search through all Caina's crew
without discovering in all this waste
a squab more fit for the aspic than these two;

not him whose breast and shadow a single blow
of the great lance of King Arthur pierced with light;
nor yet Focaccia; nor this one fastened so

into the ice that his head is all I see,
and whom, if you are Tuscan, you know well
his name on the earth was Sassol Mascheroni.

And Ito tell you all and so be through
was Camicion de' Pazzi. I wait for Carlin
beside whose guilt my sins will shine like virtue."



INFERNO 33

And leaving him, I saw a thousand faces
discolored so by cold, I shudder yet
and always will when I think of those frozen places.

As we approached the center of all weight,
where I went shivering in eternal shade,
whether it was my will, or chance, or fate,

I cannot say, but as I trailed my Guide
among those heads, my foot struck violently
against the face of one. Weeping, it cried:

"Why do you kick me? If you were not sent
to wreak a further vengeance for Montaperti,
why do you add this to my other torment?"

"Master," I said, "grant me a moment's pause
to rid myself of a doubt concerning this one;
then you may hurry me at your own pace."

The Master stopped at once, and through the volley
of foul abuse the wretch poured out, I said:
"Who are you who curse others so?" And he:

"And who are you who go through the dead larder
of Antenora kicking the cheeks of others
so hard, that were you alive, you could not kick harder?"

"I am alive," I said, "and if you seek fame,
it may be precious to you above all else
that my notes on this descent include your name."

"Exactly the opposite is my wish and hope,"
he answered. "Let me be; for it's little you know
of how to flatter on this icy slope."

I grabbed the hair of his dog's-ruff and I said:
"Either you tell me truly who you are,
or you won't have a hair left on your head."

And he: "Not though you snatch me bald. I swear
I will not tell my name nor show my face.
Not though you rip until my brain lies bare."


I had a good grip on his hair; already
I had yanked out more than one fistful of it,
while the wretch yelped, but kept his face turned from me;

when another said: "Bocca, what is it ails you?
What the Hell's wrong? Isn't it bad enough
to hear you bang your jaws? Must you bark too?"

"Now filthy traitor, say no more!" I cried,
"for to your shame, be sure I shall bear back
a true report of you." The wretch replied:

"Say anything you please but go away.
And if you do get back, don't overlook
that pretty one who had so much to say

just now. Here he laments the Frenchman's pride.
I saw Buoso da Duera, 'you can report.
Where the bad salad is kept crisp on ice.'

And if you're asked who else was wintering here,
Beccheria, whose throat was slit by Florence,
is there beside you. Gianni de' Soldanier

is further down, I think, with Ganelon,
and Tebaldello, who opened the gates of Faenza
and let Bologna steal in with the dawn."

Leaving him then, I saw two souls together
in a single hole, and so pinched in by the ice
that one head made a helmet for the other.

As a famished man chews crustsso the one sinner
sank his teeth into the other's nape
at the base of the skull, gnawing his loathsome dinner.

Tydeus in his final raging hour
gnawed Menalippus' head with no more fury
than this one gnawed at skull and dripping gore.

"You there," I said, "who show so odiously
your hatred for that other, tell me why
on this condition: that if in what you tell me



INFERNO 35

you seem to have a reasonable complaint
against him you devour with such foul relish,
I, knowing who you are, and his soul's taint,

may speak your cause to living memory,
God willing the power of speech be left to me."

CANTO 33

The sinner raised his mouth from his grim repast
and wiped it on the hair of the bloody head
whose nape he had all but eaten away. At last

he began to speak: "You ask me to renew
a grief so desperate that the very thought
of speaking of it tears my heart in two.

But if my words may be a seed that bears
the fruit of infamy for him I gnaw
I shall weep, but tell my story through my tears.

Who you may be, and by what powers you reach
into this underworld, I cannot guess,
but you seem to me a Florentine by your speech.

I was Count Ugolino, I must explain;
this reverend grace is the Archbishop Ruggieri:
now I will tell you why I gnaw his brain.

That I, who trusted him, had to undergo
imprisonment and death through his treachery,
you will know already. What you cannot know

that is, the lingering inhumanity
of the death I sufferedyou shall hear in full:
then judge for yourself if he has injured me.

A narrow window in that coop of stone
now called the Tower of Hunger for my sake
(within which others yet must pace alone)

had shown me several waning moons already
between its bars, when I slept the evil sleep
in which the veil of the future parted for me.


This beast appeared as master of a hunt
chasing the wolf and his whelps across the mountain
that hides Lucca from Pisa. Out in front

of the starved and shrewd and avid pack he had placed
Gualandi and Sismondi and Lanfranchi
to point his prey. The father and sons had raced

a brief course only when they failed of breath
and seemed to weaken; then I thought I saw
their flanks ripped open by the hounds' fierce teeth.

Before the dawn, the dream still in my head,
I woke and heard my sons, who were there with me,
cry from their troubled sleep, asking for bread.

You are cruelty itself if you can keep
your tears back at the thought of what foreboding
stirred in my heart; and if you do not weep,

at what are you used to weeping?The hour when food
used to be brought, drew near. They were now awake,
and each was anxious from his dream's dark mood.

And from the base of that horrible tower I heard
the sound of hammers nailing up the gates:
I stared at my sons' faces without a word.

I did not weep: I had turned stone inside.
They wept. 'What ails you, Father, you looks so strange,'
my little Anselm, youngest of them, cried.

But I did not speak a word nor shed a tear:
not all that day nor all that endless night,
until I saw another sun appear.

When a tiny ray leaked into that dark prison
and I saw staring back from their four faces
the terror and the wasting of my own,

I bit my hands in helpless grief. And they,
thinking I chewed myself for hunger, rose
suddenly together. I heard them say:



INFERNO 37

'Father, it would give us much less pain
i

t if you ate us: it was you who put upon us
this sorry flesh; now strip it off again.'

t I calmed myself to spare them. Ah! hard earth,
why did you not yawn open? All that day
and the next we sat in silence. On the fourth,

Gaddo, the eldest, fell before me and cried,
stretched at my feet upon that prison floor:

; 'Father, why don't you help me?' There he died.

And just as you see me, I saw them fall
one by one on the fifth day and the sixth.
Then, already blind, I began to crawl

from body to body shaking them frantically.
Two days I called their names, and they were dead.
Then fasting overcame my grief and me."

His eyes narrowed to slits when he was done,
i.

and he seized the skull again between his teeth
 grinding it as a mastiff grinds a bone.

i
i

Ah, Pisa ! foulest blemish on the land
where "si" sounds sweet and clear, since those nearby you
are slow to blast the ground on which you stand,

may Caprara and Gorgona drift from place
and dam the flooding Arno at its mouth

- until it drowns the last of your foul race !

For if to Ugolino falls the censure
for having betrayed your castles, you for your part
should not have put his sons to such a torture:

you modern Thebes ! those tender lives you spilt
Brigata, Uguccione, and the others
I mentioned earlierwere too young for guilt!

CANTO 34

"On march the banners of the King of Hell,"
my Master said. "Toward us. Look straight ahead:
can you make him out at the core of the frozen shell?"


Like a whirling windmill seen afar at twilight,
or when a mist has risen from the ground
just such an engine rose upon my sight

stirring up such a wild and bitter wind
I cowered for shelter at my Master's back,
there being no other windbreak I could find.

I stood now where the souls of the last class

(with fear my verses tell it) were covered wholly;
they shone below the ice like straws in glass.

Some lie stretched out; others are fixed in place
upright, some on their heads, some on their soles;
another, like a bow, bends foot to face.

When we had gone so far across the ice
that it pleased my Guide to show me the foul creature
which once had worn the grace of Paradise,

he made me stop, and, stepping aside, he said:
"Now see the face of Dis! This is the place
where you must arm your soul against all dread."

Do not ask, Reader, how my blood ran cold
and my voice choked up with fear. I cannot write it:
this is a terror that cannot be told.

I did not die, and yet I lost life's breath:
imagine for yourself what I became,
deprived at once of both my life and death.

The Emperor of the Universe of Pain
jutted his upper chest above the ice;
and I am closer in size to the great mountain

the Titans make around the central pit,
than they to his arms. Now, starting from this part,
imagine the whole that corresponds to it !

If he was once as beautiful as now
he is hideous, and still turned on his Maker,
well may he be the source of every woe !



INFERNO 39

With what a sense of awe I saw his head

towering above me ! for it had three faces :
one was in front, and it was fiery red;

the other two, as weirdly wonderful,
merged with it from the middle of each shoulder
to the point where all converged at the top of the skull;

the right was something between white and bile;
the left was about the color that one finds
on those who live along the banks of the Nile.

Under each head two wings rose terribly,
their span proportioned to so gross a bird:
I never saw such sails upon the sea.

They were not featherstheir texture and their form
were like a bat's wingsand he beat them so
that three winds blew from him in one great storm:

it is these winds that freeze all Cocytus.
He wept from his six eyes, and down three chins
the tears ran mixed with bloody froth and pus.

In every mouth he worked a broken sinner
between his rake-like teeth. Thus he kept three
in eternal pain at his eternal dinner.

For the one in front the biting seemed to play
no part at all compared to the ripping: at times
the whole skin of his back was flayed away.

"That soul that suffers most," explained my Guide,
"is Judas Iscariot, he who kicks his legs
on the fiery chin and has his head inside.

Of the other two, who have their heads thrust forward,
the one who dangles down from the black face
is Brutus: note how he writhes without a word.

And there, with the huge and sinewy arms, is the soul
of Cassius.But the night is coming on
and we must go, for we have seen the whole."


Then, as he bade, I clasped his neck, and he,
watching for a moment when the wings
were opened wide, reached over dexterously

and seized the shaggy coat of the king demon;
then grappling matted hair and frozen crusts
from one tuft to another, clambered down.

Purgatory
CANTO 15

As much as, tracing from the third hour's close
Till earliest dawn, appeareth of that sphere
Which like a playful child no quiet knows

So long a course the sun's declining light
Had still to traverseit was evening here,
But upon earth the very noon of night.

His beams assailed us full upon the brow;
For we had so advanced the mountain o'er,
That towards the sunset we were moving now;

When I my forehead felt oppressed with glare
Of dazzling light, far brighter than before;
And stupor seized me from effect so rare.

My hands I raised to guard my aching sight,
And o'er my forehead held them up, to hide
The overpowering effluence of light.

As when from water or a glass, the ray
Bounds from below unto the opposing side,
Ascending upward in the self-same way

That it descendedequi-distant too
From the right line a stone would take, impelled
Through the same space, as science shows is true;

So, as it seemed, by a refracted light
Shining in front of me was I assailed;
Wherefore I quickly turned away my sight.

PURGATORY

"Loved sire," I asked, "what is it I discern
Approaching tow'rds us, and from which mine e^
Unable to endure the splendour, turn?"

"Marvel not, if thou still art dazzled by
The ministering attendants of the skies
One comes," he said, "to summon man on high.

These glorious sights not long shall give thee pain,
But will inspire thee with as much delight
As nature makes thee able to sustain."

When near we came unto the angel blest,
"Enter," with joyful voice he said; "this height
Presents a stair far easier than the rest."

Ascending thencebehind us sang a voice:
"Blest are the merciful," in sweetest lay,
"And thou victorious one, do thou rejoice."

Slow up the ascent were labouring on we two
My guide and I; I, thinking on my way
That from his speech some profit might accrue;

Then, turning, made I this inquiry: "What
Could mean the spirit of Romagna, when
He spoke of good, with others shared or not?"

Then he: "Full well he knows the cost severe
Of his besetting sin; no marvel then
If man he warned, to abate his suffering here.

Because your wishes to such objects tend
As are diminished if another share,
In envy's full blown sighs they ever end.

But if the love of the celestial sphere
To higher objects had allured your care,
Your breast would not be troubled by that fear.

For there the more the expression 'our' we use,
So much more good to each one's lot will fall,
And greater warmth will charity diffuse."


"Now," I replied, "am I far more perplexed
Than if thou had'st not answered me at all;
And with more troublous doubts my mind is vexed:

How can it be, that a possession, shared
By many persons, can enrich them more
Than if the same is but on few conferred?"

Then he: "Because thine intellectual sight
Is wholly bent earth's objects to explore,
Darkness thou gatherest from the all-perfect Light.

That Good ineffable which dwells above,
As ray to lucid body swift descends,
So, in unbounded fulness speeds to love.

The warmth it finds, the same it still bestows;
And wide soe'er as charity extends,
Beyond it still the eternal Virtue glows.

The more aspirants are there of the sky,
More good there is to love, and more is loved,
As mirrors by reflection multiply:

And if a further answer thou request,
See Beatrice, by whom shall be removed
This and each other longing of thy breast.

Exert thee now without delay to efface,
E'en as the two, each still remaining wound,
Which due contrition soonest may erase."

I was about to say, "I am content;"
But paused, when coming to another round,
On novel sights my curious eyes were bent.

There an extatic vision suddenly
Seemed to enwrap me; and a multitude
Assembled in a temple met mine eye.

And with a mother's look, methought e'en thus
A lady cried, who on the threshold stood:
"Why, O my son, hast thou so dealt with us?



PURGATORY 43

Behold thy sire and I full many a day
Have sought thee sorrowing." Ceased her gentle strain;
And this first vision floated soon away.

Then came in view a matron, from whose eyes
Were streaming down her cheeks such tears amain,
As from indignant wrath are wont to rise.

"If of that city thou art lord," she said,
"Whose name caused discord 'mid the heavenly race,
And where each science doth its lustre shed,

Punish those arms that so audaciously
Presumed our virgin daughter to embrace."
Pisistratus all mildly made reply,

With look benevolent and temperate:
"How shall we treat the man who wills our woe,
If he who loves us meets so harsh a fate?"

With fury then inflamed, I saw a crowd
Stoning a youth; and as they struck each blow,
"Away with him, away," they cried aloud.

I saw him, as to earth he bent at last,
Weighed down in death by the o'erpowering blows;
But stedfast still to heaven his eyes he cast,

In that dread conflict, to the Lord above
Praying for pardon on his ruthless foes,
With gentle look that doth to pity move.

When to itself my mind returned again,
And on substantial things its aim could keep,
I found my wanderings were not wholly vain.

My guide, remarking my uncertain gait,
Like his who tries to rouse himself from sleep,
Cried: "What comes o'er thee? canst thou not walk straight?

Above a mile hast thou thy journey made
With eyes half shut, and reeling to and fro,
Like to a man by wine or slumber swayed."


"Loved sire," I said, "if thou wilt hear my tale,
The dream I witnessed will I strive to show,
What time my tottering limbs appeared to fail."

"Hadst thou a hundred masks upon thy face,"
He answered me, "yet e'en thy very dreams,
And inmost thoughts have I the power to trace.

What thou hast seen Heaven's favour did bestow,
Thy heart to open to the peaceful streams
Which from the Eternal Fountain ever flow.

I asked not, 'what comes o'er thee,' with the intent
Of one whose faculty of sight is gone,
Soon as the soul is from the body rent;

But I inquired, to urge thee to proceed:
Thus it behoves to spur slow loiterers on,
That when the watch returneth, they may speed."

Then towards the west we still pursued our way,
Extending as we went our ravished sight
Against the splendour of the evening ray;

When lo ! approaching us, came gradually
A vapour dense and dark as blackest night;
Nor was there shelter whither we could fly:

Our eyes were dimmed, and all obscured the light.

CANTO 16

Nor gloom of Hell, nor shade of blackest night,
When not a star illumes the barren heaven,
And clouds of massy darkness block the light,

My face e'er covered with a veil so dense
As did that murky smoke, around us driven,
And to the touch, of sharpness so intense.

In vain I strove to keep my eyes unclosed,
Until my faithful escort, drawing near,
His shoulder to assist my steps disposed.



PURGATORY 45

As one bereft of sight behind his guide
Walks, lest he stray and meet some shock severe,
Or aught whence greater evils may betide;

So went I through that foul and pungent air,
List'ning my leader's words, who did not cease
His warning: "How you quit my side, beware."

Voices I heard; and each appeared to pray
Unto the Lamb for pardon and for peace
The Lamb of God that taketh sins away;

And "Agnus Dei" was their prelude still.
All in one measure, in one voice unite;
And perfect concord seemed to rule their will.

"Are spirits these we hear?" I then inquire.
He gave me answer: "Thou hast guessed aright;
They loose the fetters of their former ire."

"Now who art thou who through our smoky air
Passest along, and speakest of our band,
As one who still by calends counts the year?"

Thus spake a single voice; whereat my guide:
"Return an answer to them, and demand
If this way leadeth up the mountain's side."

And I: "Thou, who dost cleanse thee, to return
Pure to thy great Creator, follow me;
And things of wondrous import shalt thou learn."

"Follow I will, far as I may," he said,
"And if the smoke permit me not to see,
Hearing shall keep me near to thee instead."

I then began: "Enveloped in that frame
Which death dissolves, do I ascend on high:
And through the infernal gloom I hither came.

Since then hath God on me such grace bestowed,
As to behold His Courts with mortal eye,
In this most strange and unaccustomed mode,


Conceal not who you were before you died;
And if this path may reach the opening, tell:
By your direction we our steps shall guide."

"I was a Lombard; Marco was my name;
I knew the world, and loved that virtue well
To which no mortal now directs his aim.

To mount above thou takest the proper way;
And when thou there arrivest, let me crave
That thou forget not for my soul to pray."

Then I: "As far as promises can bind,
I will obey thee: but one doubt I have,
That, unexplained, is bursting in my mind.

Single before, that doubt is now made twain
By thy opinion, rendering me more sure,
When coupled with what elsewhere I obtain.

Lost is the world, e'en as thou sayest, indeed
To every virtue; and is so impure,
That evil there on every side doth beerd.

But what the cause I do entreat thee show,
That I may understand and tell to other;
For one, in heaven, one places it below."

A sigh profound he drew, by grief intense
Forced into "Oh"he then began: "O brother!
The world is blind, and sure thou comest thence.

Ye mortals to the heavenly orbs each cause
Ascribe; as though a first necessity
Moved all things in obedience to its laws:

Which (were it true) in you it would destroy
Free-will; and then unjustly should we see
Woe dealt to evil deeds, to virtue joy.

Your movements have their impulse first from heaven;
I say not all; but had I so asserted,
To choose 'twixt good and evil, light is given,



PURGATORY 47

And freedom of the will; which in the first
Encounter with the stars, stands, if exerted;
Then conquers all if it be duly nurst.

Though free, yet are ye subject to the sway
Of higher power, that in you plants the mind,
Which cares not starry influence to obey.

If in the paths of error then ye rove,
The cause is in yourselves, as ye will find;
And this more clearly I to thee will prove.

Forth from His hand, who, ere it see the day,
Views it delightedlike some infant child,
Weeping and smiling in its sportive way,

The artless soul springs forthnot knowing aught
Except to turn to joy, whence it is thrilled
Spontaneous, by its gladsome Maker taught.

Some trifling good, first tasted with delight,
Leads it astray, and tempts it to pursue,
Unless restrained or guided on aright.

Laws needful hence, a bridle to impose
A ruler hencewho of the city true
The towers at least may from afar disclose.

Laws are there; but who keeps the laws in view?
For knowthe Shepherd who the flock doth lead
Parts not the hoof, although the cud he chew.

And hence it is, the tribe who see their guide
Aim at the good they value most, do feed
On that alone, nor care for aught beside.

Ill guidance, as ye plainly may descry,
Hath led the world in wicked paths astray;
And not your nature's bad propensity.

To Rome, which taught the ancient world good deeds,
Two suns were wont to point the twofold way,
That of the world, and that to God which leads.


The one hath quenched the otherwith the crook
The sword is joined; and scarce it need be told
How ill the twain such combination brook,

Since one no longer doth the other curb.
Look to the grain, if credit thou withhold;
For by its fruit is known each several herb.

The country washed by Adic and Po
For courtesy and valour once was famed,
Ere Frederick had sustained his overthrow.

Securely there may pass each villain now,
Who dared not then have shown his face, ashamed
To talk with good men and confront their brow.

Still live there three, in whom the olden time
Reproves the vices of these latter days;
And much they wish to reach a happier clime

Currado da Palazzo, good Gherrd,
And da Castel, who, in the Frenchman's phrase,
Is called more properly the plain Lombard.

Know then, Rome's Church, oppressed by too much weight,
Confounding the two governments, hath brought
Herself into the mire with all her freight."

"Marco," I said, "thy argument is good;
Now know I why from the heritage 'twas thought
Better the sons of Levi to exclude.

But who is that Gherrd, who, as you said,
Reproves a vicious age, and seems to be
Left as a sample of the mighty dead?"

"To dupe or try me is thy speech preferred,
Since, Tuscan though it is," he answered me,
"Of good Gherrd thou seem'st not to have heard.

Him by no other surname do I know,
Unless his daughter Gaia one prepare.
God speed you, for no more with you I go.



PURGATORY 49

Piercing the mistbehold the morning ray
Already whitens: I must leave thee, ere
The Angel who is yonder, comes this way."

He spake; nor further question would he hear.

CANTO 17

Remember, reader, if thou e'er hast been
Wrapt in dark mist upon an Alpine height,
Through which, but as a mole doth through his skin,

Thine eye could piercehow, when the thick moist shroud
Begins to melt away, the solar light
Feebly and faintly penetrates the cloud;

And swift will thy imagination be
To form a just conception, how the sun,
Which now was setting, first appeared to me,

As, keeping even with my faithful guide,
Forth from such murky cloud my way I won
To the low shores whereon the rays had died.

O Fancy, in whose chain we oft are bound
So lost to outward things we take no thought,
Although a thousand trumpets clang around;

What moves thee, if no impulse sense bestow?
Light moves thee, in the clime of heaven self-wrought,
Or by his will who sendeth it below.

Imagination painted to my sight
Her crime who was transformed into the bird

Excelling all that in the song delight:

And so abstracted was my mind within,
That from without was nothing seen or heard,
Which had the power acceptance there to win.

Into my lofty fancy then was showered
One crucified, enraged and fierce to view,
Such as in death his savage soul he poured.


Round him the great Ahasuerus stood,
Esther his wife, and Mordecai the Jew,
In word and deed pre-eminently good.

And as this vision of my fancy burst,
Like to a bubble, which hath sudden been
Left by the water which composed it first,

Before my sight a youthful maid arose,
Profusely weeping, as she cried: "O queen,
Whence came the wrathful wish thy life to close?



To save Lavinia's life, hath death been thine;
Yet hast thou lost her; and for thee I weep,
Mourning thy fate more bitterly than mine."

As when a sudden and o'erpowering light
Strikes our closed eyes, and breaks upon our sleep,
Quivering a moment ere it takes its flight;

So the imagined vision sank below,
Soon as a splendour burst upon mine eye
Surpassing all that on the earth we know.

I turned to view the place I now had gained,
When cried a voice: "Ye here may mount on high,"
Which from all other thoughts my mind restrained,

And with such eagerness inspired my breast
To look upon the person who thus spoke,
Nought less than actual sight had given me rest.

E'en as the sun our mortal ken weighs down,
Its very radiance to itself a cloak,
So here my visual power was overthrown.

"A heavenly spirit this, who up the height,
Unasked by us, wou^d fain our journey speed,
Veiling his presence with excess of light.

He uses us as man himself would use;
For he who waits entreaty, seeing need,
Inclines his mind already to refuse.



PURGATORY 51

Then let us not such invitation spurn,
But to the mount, ere it grow dark, repair;
We may not afterwards, till day return."

Thus spake my faithful guideby him attended
I bent my course up to a lofty stair:
And ere the lowest step we had ascended,

I felt a wind upon my face, as though
Fanned by a pinion;and these words were said;
"Blessed are they who peace on earth bestow."

The sun's last rays that usher in the night,
Were now upraised so high above my head,
That stars on every side appeared in sight.

"Why, O my virtue," to myself I said,
When I perceived my limbs could not command
Their former strength, "why art thou vanquished?"

Arriving at a landing, whence no more
The staircase led above, we took our stand,
Like to a ship when she hath come ashore.

Some little time attentively I tried
In this new circle to distinguish sound;
Then to the master turned again and cried:

"O my dear Father, tell what sinful blot
Receives ablution in the present round;
Though rest our feetthy speech, withhold it not."

And he to me: "The love of good, curtailed
Of its proportions, here obtains them full;
Here plies the oar that erst through loitering failed.

But to perceive more clearly what I say,
Direct thy thoughts to me; and thou shalt cull
Some fruit of goodly sort from our delay.

Creator nor created being e'er
Was wholly void of love, my son," he said,
"Or natural love or mental, as is clear.


The natural love was aye from error free;
The other into error may be led,
Or through excess, or through deficiency.

To primal good while it directs its aim,
Or secondary, keeping measure due,
It cannot tend to aught deserving blame:

But when perverted or when too intent,
Or slack, some goodly object to pursue,
'Gainst the Creator is the creature bent.

Hence it is clear that Love implants the seed
Of all the virtues that your bosoms sway,
And also of each unbecoming deed.

Now, from the safety of the object loved
Since Love can never turn its face away,
So from self hatred are all things removed.

And since no one in self-existent state

Lives, independent of his primal source,
It follows clearly none that source can hate.

This love of ill then, (if the truth I say)
Against its neighbour must direct its course,
And in three modes is gendered in your clay;

One by his neighbour's fall aspires to be
Exalted, and upon this sole account
He longs to see him sunk to low degree.

Another is depressed through fear to lose
Power, grace, and honour, should a rival mount;
Whence grieving, he his neighbour's fall pursues.

Another, roused by injury, longs to wreak
His fiery wrath, and vengeance to obtain;
And he must needs his neighbour's misery seek:

Beneath us is this triple love subdued.
Now of that other love some knowledge gain,
Which keeps no measure, though it aims at good.



PURGATORY 53

Some blessing indistinct is wished by each,
In which the soul a sweet repose may find;
Whence all essay their several good to reach:

If love too languid urges to pursue,
Or to obtain it,to this round assigned,
After repentance, meet ye sufferings due.

Another good there isnot cause of bliss
Not full fruitionnot that essence true,
Of every good the source: the love of this,

By mortal man too lavishly indulged,
The inmates of the higher circles rue:
How triply shared is not by me divulged

The search of this thou mayst thyself pursue."

CANTO 18

His reasoning ended, my exalted guide
Attentively surveyed my countenance,
To see if I were fully satisfied.

And I, by further cravings now possest,
Spake not aloud, but said within: "Perchance
He by my constant questions is opprest."

But that true father, who at once perceived
The timid wish I had not dared to tell,
Soon by his speech my fear to speak relieved.

Then I: "My sight, O master, gains such force
In thy clear rays, that I discern full well



All that is meant and taught in thy discourse.

Wherefore, sweet Father dear, I pray thee show
That love, whence every action fraught with shame,
And all good deeds, as thou hast told me, flow!"

"Direct the sharpened lustres of thy mind
To me," he said, "while I their fault proclaim,



Who think, though blind themselves, to lead the blind.


The soul, which is created prone to love,
Awakened into action by delight,
To all that pleases doth obedient move.

Your apprehension from some object true
An image draws, unfolding it to sight,
So that the soul is tempted to pursue.

And if the mind thus wrought on, is inclined,
That inclination is a natural love,
Newly produced by pleasure in your mind.

Thus, e'en as fire spontaneous mounts on high,
Created apt to raise itself above,
And reach again its storehouse in the sky;

The soul, so smitten, enters on desire
A spiritual motion, resting never
Till the beloved object it acquire.

Now will appear to thee how far they err
From truth, who love of every kind whatever,
As in itself deserving praise, aver.

Love may itself perhaps be understood
As always good; but still we sometimes find
The impression bad, although the wax be good."

I answered: "Love to me is rendered plain
By thy discourse, and my attentive mind;
But this hath filled me with my doubts again.

For, if from outward objects love gains force,
And such sole force to sway the mind avails,
No merit has it, right or wrong its course."

"As far as Reason," he replied, "can reach,
I may direct thee; but when Reason fails
'Tis Faith that works, and Beatrice must teach.

Each spiritual essence, that is joined
With matter that in separate state exists,
Contains within the virtue of its kind;



PURGATORY 55

Which, if it worketh not, remains unseen,
Save in the effect: as in a plant subsists
Life, not perceived but by the foliage green,

So, from what source the apprehension springs
Of first ideas, vainly men inquire,
Or whence comes passion for the first loved things.

They live in man, as instinct in the bee
For making honey; and this first desire
Nor praise nor censure can infer to thee.

That every other wish round this may bend,
In you is placed a power, whose warning voice
Should still the threshold of the will defend.

This is the source, whence praise or blame accrues,
As good or bad affections are your choice
Winnowed by each, who this or that pursues.

Those who the matter fully sifted, knew
This innate liberty, and felt its force;
Whence moral codes for after times they drew.



Hence lay we down, that from necessity
Each love that in you springs derives its source;
But in yourselves the powers to check it lie.

Free-will is termed 'the noble faculty'
By Beatrice; remember then to bear
This, if she speak of it, in memory."

The moon, that tardily at midnight came,
Was making now the stars appear more rare,
In figure like a bucket all in flame

Stemming the heaven abandoned by the sun,
Between the Corsie and Sardinian coast,
When Rome beholds him as his course is run:


And that kind shade who hath more fame bestowed
On Pietola than Mantua e'er could boast,
Had eased my mind of its oppressive load;


When I (whose doubts had all been set at rest
By reason clear and argument refined)
Stood like to one by drowsiness opprest.

But vanished soon this drowsiness; for now
Game suddenly, approaching from behind,
A troop of spirits o'er the mountain's brow:

And like the fury and the crowd displayed
Ismenus' and Asopus' banks beside,
Whene'er the Thebans called for Bacchus' aid;

So each, throughout this round, as I beheld,
Urging his hurried footstep, onward hied,
By goodly zeal and righteous love impelled.

They reach'd us soonso rapidly they swept;
(For none amid that crowd immense was slack)
And two in front cried, shouting as they wept;

"The Virgin sought the hills without delay;
And Caesar, hastening into Spain, to attack
Ilerda, smote Marseilles upon his way."

"Haste, haste," the others cried who near them stood,
"Through want of love be time not thrown away;
Grace springs anew from ardour to do good."

"O ye in whom a fervour, now acute,
Doth haply compensate for old delay,
Which to lukewarmness owed its primal root;

This man who lives (no idle tale I feign)
Would with the rising sun ascend the steep;
Then say where nearest he the stair may gain."

These words were spoken by my faithful guide;
When, "Close behind us now the pathway keep,
And thou shalt find the entrance," one replied,

"So anxious to pursue our course are we,
We cannot pause;forgiveness then we pray,
If this our duty rudeness seem to be.



PURGATORY 57

San Zeno's Abbot in Verona I,
What time good Barbarossa's arm held sway,
Whom Milan speaks of yet lamentingly.

He with one foot already in the grave
Shall for that monastery shortly mourn,
And for the abuse of power forgiveness crave;

Since he, for Shepherd of the flock proclaimed
His son, in mind defective, and ill born,
Nor less in person than in temper maimed."

CANTO 31

"Thou whom beyond the sacred stream I see,"
Thus quickly she began her speech anew,
Turning forthwith its point direct on me,

Although full sharp the side alone had seemed,
"Answer me; is this accusation true?
By free confession be the fault redeemed."

Confusion so o'erwhelmed me at the sound,
The words expired within my lips, ere they
Had through the organs their expression found.

Awhile she paused; then uttered: "Answer me,
For not yet hath the water washed away
The mournful traces from thy memory."

Fear and confusion, mixt together, drew
Forth from my lips an answering "yes," so faint,
That to perceive it, sight was needed too.

As breaks a bow before the arrow flies,
When both the wood and cord are overbent,
And to the mark the shaft more feebly hies;

So I beneath this heavy burden quailed,
Pouring forth sighs and tears, a bitter flood;
And, ere the words had reached my lips, they failed.

Whence she resumed: "To thwart those high desires
Instilled by me, which bade thee love that Good,
Noblest to which the soul of man aspires


What interposing trenches didst thou find,
What chains, that thus, foregoing liberty,
All hope of further progress was resigned?

And what attraction, what advantages
In other foreheads were perceived by thee,
That taught thee those to woo instead of these?'1

After the drawing of a bitter sigh,
My lips with difficulty answer made,
And scarce had power to fashion a reply.

Weeping, I said: "My steps were turned aside
By the false pleasure present things displayed,
Soon as your face was to my view denied."

"Hadst thou been silent, or refused to own
Thy fault," she said, "our knowledge would have reached
That fault, by One omniscient clearly known.

When tears however, gushing forth, allege
The conscious sinner, by himself impeached,
In this our court the wheel rebates the edge:

But that more shame may expiate thy crime,
And with more strength thy spirit may be fraught.
Listening the Syren's voice another time,

Dismiss the cause of tears, and hear from me,
What different effect should have been wrought
By the announcement of my death to thee.

No lure to equal those fair limbs of mine,
Now unto dust returned, did ever art,
Or nature, to attract thine eyes, design:

And if with charm of such supreme delight
Thy doom it was, at my decease, to part,
What mortal thing should have allured thy sight?

At the first shaft which struck thee from the bow
Of treacherous things, thou shouldest have soared above,
Pursuing me, not frail, as when below.



PURGATORY 59

Became thee not to stoop thy wing to earth
To wait fresh snaressome youthful maiden's love,
Or other vanity of equal worth.

Though the young bird may twice or thrice forget,
Yet in the view of those full-plumed, his aim
The fowler takes in vain, or spreads his net."

As little children, with their eyes bent low,
Stand listeningmute, through consciousness of shame,
Convicted and repentant; even so

I stood; and she resumed: "Since but to hear
Afflicts thee, raise thy beard, and let thine eyes
Witness a cause of sorrow more severe."

With less resistance by the root is torn
Some sturdy oak, when northern blasts arise,
Or those from Afric's land, impetuous borne,

Than lifted I my chin, as she directed;
For when instead of "face" she said my "beard,"
I knew the venom that her speech infected:

And, stretching out my face, beheld those fair
Primaeval creatures, which before appeared,
Cease from the sprinkling of the flowers they bare.

And I, though scarcely was restored my sight,
Saw Beatrice admire that Form Divine,
Which in itself two natures doth unite.

On the green bankher veil around her cast
She seemed still more her former self to outshine,
Than, while on earth, all others she surpast.

Repentant stings so struggled in my soul,
I contemplated now with hate and shame
All that had swayed me with supreme control.

Such keen remorse was kindled in my breast,
I swoon'd away; and what I then became
She knows, whose mighty presence I confessed.


Soon as my heart fresh vigour had supplied,
The Lady, whom before I found alone,
I saw above me; "Holdkeep hold," she cried;

Then drew me to the stream; and as she bore
My sinking form, her way she quickly won,
Light as a shuttle, that dark water o'er.

Nearing the sacred bankcame on mine ear
"Asperges me" in strain so passing sweet,
Recall I cannot, much less write it here.

The beauteous lady straight, her arms extending,
Embraced my head, and plunged me where 'twas meet
That I should taste the wave; then, lowly bending,

She raised me up, and offered me, so laved,
Within the circle of the Maids benign,
Who, as they danced, their arms around me waved.

Nymphs are we here below, and stars in heaven:
To Beatrice, ere from her seat divine,
She hither came, were we for handmaids given.

We to her eyes will lead thee; but to bear
The joyous light within, shall yonder three,
Profound of ken, thy visual sense prepare."

Singing melodiously, commenced they thus;
Then to the Griffon's breast conducted me,
Where Beatrice was standing, turned to us.

"Now satisfy," they said, "thy anxious view;
Thee have we placed before the emeralds bright,
Whence Love erewhile his shafts against thee drew."

A thousand longings more intense than fire
Mine eyes attracted to those eyes of light,
Fixt on the Griffon with profound desire:

And in them, like unto the sun pourtrayed
Within a glass, the two-fold thing was beaming
His either nature there by turns displayed.


PURGATORY 61

Think, reader, what surprise was mine, to see
An object, in itself so tranquil seeming,
Bear in its image such diversity.

Whilst, filled with deepest wonder and delight,
My soul was tasting of that heavenly food,
Which, satisfying, wakes new appetite,

The other three irradiate forms advance:
How great their rank their high demeanour showed
And songs accompanied their angel dance.

"Turn, Beatrice, O turn" (this was their song)
"Thy holy eyes unto thy faithful one,
Who hath, to view thee, made such journey long.

Do thou at our entreaty here reveal
Thy smile to him, and make thy beauty known
That second beauty thou dost now conceal."

O splendour of eternal living light !
Who, though grown pale beneath Parnassus' shade,
Or wont to quaff the rills from that fair height,

Would not betray the mental strain, should he
Attempt to picture thee, thou peerless Maid,
When, compassed with celestial harmony,

Thou in unshrouded beauty wert displayed?

CANTO 32

Bent were mine eyes with ardour so intense
To sate their ten years' thirst, that all the while
Lost in oblivion was each other sense:

On either side of them a wall was set,
To exclude ought else; so did that sacred smile
Again enthral them with its ancient net;

When towards the left my looks were forcibly
Diverted by those Nymphs, on hearing one
Exclaim, addressing me; "Too earnestly:"


And a sensation of o'erpowering light,
As when the eyes are dazzled by the sun,
Deprived me for some moments of my sight.

But when my vision was in part renewed,
So that mine eyes were able to discern
Objects less splendid than those lately viewed,

I saw that on the right that glorious host
Had wheeled around; and, making now a turn,
Before the flames and sun took up their post.

E'en as a troop, beneath their bucklers ranged
For greater safety, turn on either hand,
Ere their direction can be wholly changed;

So now, of that celestial armament
Passed onward in like guise the leading band,
Ere the triumphal car its beam had bent.

Then to the wheels those Nymphs themselves betaking,
The Griffon moved his blessed burden thence,
Although so gently, not a plume was shaking.

The beauteous maid who drew me o'er the tide
Followed the wheel of less circumference,
By Statius and myself accompanied.

As thus we passed throughout the lofty wood,
Void through the fault of Eve, in unison
With angel notes our journey we pursued.

About the distance that an arrow, thrice
Loosed from the string, might compass, had we gone,
When from the car descended Beatrice.

Then "Adam" muttered all in accents low;
And in a circle round a tree they went,
Stript of each leaf, without a flower to show.

Its head, which, as it rises, doth dilate
The more, so lofty grows, that wonderment
In Indians 'mid their groves it would create.



PURGATORY 63

"Blessed, O Griffon! art thou not to rend
This tree, which needs must be surpassing sweet,
Since it allured our Parents to offend."

Thus cried they, as they circled round the tree;
And He in whom the twofold natures meet;
"Yea, so fulfilled all righteousness must be."

Then to the chariot's beam straight turning round,
He drew it to the tree bereft of spray,
And left it, by a twig together bound.

As, when from heaven descends the glorious light,
Mingled with that which when the Pisces' ray
Departs, beams forth with more effective might,

Our plants swell out, and re-enlivened are
With its own hues, or ere the sun unite
His fiery steeds beneath some other star;

With tints less vivid than the rose, but more
Deep than the violet, was that plant now dight,
Which of its foliage was so stript before.

The words they sang I could not comprehend;
For not to earth belonged their melodies;
Nor did I hear their notes unto the end.

Could I but sing how heavy slumber weighed,
At tale of Syrinx' woe, the unpitying eyes,
That dearly for their high distinction paid,

Like one who from a model draws, might I
Depict the manner of my slumber deep;
But to describe it, whoso will, may try.

Passing to when I woke, hence tell I, how
A flash of splendour burst the veil of sleep,
A voice too, crying: "Rise; what doest thou?"

As (led to view the flowerets of that tree
For whose delicious fruit the Angels pine,
In heaven a source of ceaseless jubilee,)


Turned back the Apostles Peter, James and John,
From sleep awakened at the Word divine,
By which had deeper sleep been overthrown;

And witnessed straight their little band grow less
Moses departed, and Elias too
And their great Master altered in his dress;

So I awakening, roused me from my dream,
And saw that pitying Maid stand o'er me, who
Had led my steps along the sacred stream.

And, "Where is Beatrice?" in doubt I cried.
"Beneath the new-born leaves behold her there,
Upon the root reclining," she replied;

"Behold the maidens who her form surround:

Following the Griffon, mount the rest in air
With sweeter minstrelsy and more profound."

Whether to greater length her words were brought
I know not, since before mine eyes was She
Who barred the entrance to each other thought.

Alone she sate upon the quickened ground,
As though the car were in her custody,
Which there the twofold animal had bound.

Into a circle formed themselves anon
The Nymphs, those lights supporting in their hands
Which Auster quencheth not, or Aquiln.

"Brief space this forest shall thy dwelling be;
And in that Rome where Christ himself commands
Shalt thou be fellow-citizen with me.

Whence, that the evil world some good may learn,
Look on the car, and all that meets thine eye
Forget not to record, on thy return."

These words spake Beatrice; and I, resigned
To execute her will implicitly,
E'en as she bade, applied my eyes and mind.



PURGATORY 65

Ne'er from thick cloud, by force ethereal riven,
With such velocity was lightning sent,
When falling from the farthest bound of heaven;

As down the bird of Jove impetuous flew
Straight through the tree, by which the bark was rent
Much more the tender boughs and foliage new.

He struck the car with all his force, whereat
It quailed like vessel tempest tost, and driven
Now by the waves on this side, now on that.

Then up into the vehicle I viewed
A she-fox leap, to greediness so given,
She seemed rapacious of all goodly food.

But chiding her for this unseemly deed
My Lady put her to such rapid flight,
Her skinny bones could scarce endure the speed.

Then from the quarter whence he came before,
The Eagle swooped into the chariot bright,
And left it with his feathers covered o'er.

And such a voice as issues from a heart
Grief stricken, came from heaven; and thus it said:
"Oh, how ill freighted, little bark thou art!"

Then seemed it that the earth did gape betwixt
The wheels; and thence in sight a Dragon sped,
Which, turning up its tail, the car transfixed.

And like a wasp that draweth back its sting,
So, drawing back his venomed tail, he rent
Part of the car, and fled with joyous wing.

And as the earth with herbage is renewed,
So the remainder an integument
Formed of the feathers, with intention good

Haply presented; and as rapidly
Were both the pole and wheels therewith o'erspread,
As the lips open to express a sigh.


The sacred Structure, thus diversified,
Through every part of it put forth a head;
Three at the pole, and one on either side.

Horns the first three, like unto oxen, bore;
One single horn the four among them reared;
Nor was such monster ever seen before.

Firm as a rock upon some mountain high,
A wanton harlot, seated there, appeared,
Who threw on every side a wandering eye:

And lest she should be carried from that height,
A giant sitting close to her I viewed;
And oft they kissed each other in my sight.

But when with mine her roving eyes did meet,
Her dread companion lashed her in fierce mood,
E'en from the head unto the very feet.

Then did he loose th beast, with anger keen
Incensed, and through the wood such distance drew,
The boughs alone afforded ample screen

To hide the damsel and the monster new.

CANTO 33

"O God, the heathen have defiled thy fane,"
Alternate now the three and now the four,
Suffused with tears, began the holy train.

And Beatrice was listening, so subdued
By pity, that scarce Mary's features wore
More signs of grief, when at the cross she stood.

But when the other virgins had given place
For her to speak, she raised herself upright,
And answered to their words with glowing face:

"A little whileye shall not me behold;
And yet again, O sisters, my delight,
A little while, and me ye shall behold."

Then all the seven in front of her she set,
And, beckoning unto me, a wish conveyed
That I should follow, with the sage, who yet



PURGATORY 67

Remained, and that fair damsel: thus she went:
Nor had she, I believe, the tenth step made,
Advancing, when her eyes on mine were bent;

And with a tranquil look she said: "Come near,
That, should I be inclined to speak to thee,
Thou mayest be able my discourse to hear."

When, as in duty bound, I had complied,
"Why, brother, not attempt to question me,"
She added, "as thou journeyest by my side?"

As those, who, moved with too much reverence, strive
To speak in presence of their betters, so
That to the lips comes not the voice alive;

Thus it befel me, that scarce audibly,
"O Lady," I began, "my wants ye know,
And can a fitting remedy supply."

And thus she answered: "Banish shame and fear;
That not like his who talketh in a dream
Henceforth the tenor of thy words appear.

Know that the vessel which the serpent hurt,
Was, and is not: nor let the offender deem
That by a sop Heaven's wrath he may avert.

Without an heir the eagle not for aye
Shall be, who left his feathers in the car,
Whence it became a monsterthen a prey:

I see full surelytherefore I declare
The approach of constellations, from all bar
And hindrance free, bringing a season near,

Wherein, One, stamped five hundred ten and five,
Angel of Godshall slay the thievish dame,
Her giant partner too of life deprive.

And haply my narration, dark, like those
Of Sphinx or Themis, credit may not claim,
Since o'er the mind, like them, a cloud it throws:


But soon, this hard enigma to explain,
The events shall be the Oedipus; nor blade
Nor flock therefrom shall injury sustain.

Mark thou; and ever as I spend my breath,
Be these my words to those alive conveyed
Whose life is but a constant race to death.

And when thou writest, tell what thou hast seen
Relating to this memorable tree,
Which twice already there despoiled hath been.

Whoever rends it, or commits abuse,
Offendeth God by act of blasphemy,
Who made it sacred, solely for his use.

Through tasting it, five thousand years and more
Yearned the first soul in longing and in woe
For Him who in his flesh the penance bore.

Thy reason sleeps, unless it hath appeared
For some especial cause inverted so,
And heavenward with such soaring head upreared:

And had not idle thoughts wrought in thy mind
As Elsa's stream; and their false pleasures been
A Pyramus to stain it, thou wouldst find

God's justice plainly evidenced to thee:
And in these circumstances would be seen
The moral of the interdicted tree.

But since thine intellect is turned to stone,
And is so dyed by sin, that at the glare
Of these my words 'tis dazed and overthrown,

Bear them along with thee, if not expressed,
Sketched out at least; like pilgrim wont to bear
His staff, returning home, with palm-leaf dressed."

Then I: "As wax the impression doth retain,
Which from the seal imprinted it derives,
So now by thee is stamped my very brain.



PURGATORY 69

But wherefore doth thy wished-for converse soar
Above my mind, which, as the more it strives
To reach the summit, loses it the more?"

"The school which thou hast followed," she replied,
"I wish thee to discern, and see how far
Its lore falls short in following me thy guide;

And see how distant from the path divine
The ways of manas distant e'en as are
From earth those heavens which most exalted shine."

"I cannot recollect," I answered her,
"Any estrangement in my love for thee;
Nor doth my conscience tell me that I err."

"If then" (this answer with a smile she gave)
"Thou canst not call it to thy memory,
Think how thou lately tastedst Lethe's wave:

And as from smoke, fire surely is inferred,
So, of a will enticed away elsewhere
Doth this oblivion prove the guilt incurred.

Truly my words as naked now shall be,
As haply may thine eyes be fit to bear,
Not wont such mighty mystery to see."

With more resplendence and with slower pace
The sun on the meridian mounted high,
Whose aspect varies with the change of place

When, as a scout sent out before a band
Draws up, on seeing aught of novelty;
E'en thus the seven fair damsels took their stand

At the far limit of a death-like shade
Like that beneath black boughs and foliage green
O'er the cool streams in Alpine glens displayed.

Springing before them from the self-same source
Methought were Tigris and Euphrates seen,
Like friends, each loth to take a separate course.


"O light, O glory of the human race,
What water this, which flows with double tide
Forth from one fount, borne hence thro' distant space?"

To my request was made this answer: "Pray
Matelda to inform thee." Then replied
(Like one who somewhat in excuse would say)

The beauteous maid: "By me were told to him
Both these and other things; and sure am I
That Lethe's water hath not made them dim."

Then Beatrice: "Perhaps some weightier care,
Which oftentimes destroys the memory,
Hath made the intellectual eye less clear.

To Euno's fount do thou direct his course,
And, as thou art wont, revive his overthrown
And drooping virtue in its crystal source."

Like to some gentle soul, that frameth no
Excuse, but makes another's will her own,
At the first signal given her; even so

Advanced the beauteous lady, soon as she
My hand had taken; and with courteous air
To Statius said: "Thou bear him company."

Had I, O reader, space to writein part
At least, then would I sing that beverage rare,
Whose sweetness ne'er had satisfied my heart:

But since the leaves, to this my second strain
Allowed, are fullno longer be pursued
The theme, and Art restrict me with her rein.

From that most sacred water back I came

Regenerate, like plants that are renewed
With foliage fresh,made pure throughout my frame,

And with a will to mount the stars endued.

Paradise

CANTO 30

Perchance six thousand miles remote from us
Is glowing the sixth hour, and now this world
Inclines its shadow almost to a level,

When the mid-heaven begins to make itself
So deep to us, that here and there a star
Ceases to shine so far down as this depth,

And as advances bright exceedingly
The handmaid of the sun, the heaven is closed
Light after light to the most beautiful;

Not otherwise the Triumph, which forever
Plays round about the point that vanquished me,
Seeming enclosed by what itself encloses,

Little by little from my vision faded;
Thereat to turn mine eyes on Beatrice
Only seeing nothing and my love constrained me.

If what has hitherto been said of her
Were all concluded in a single praise,
Scant would it be to serve the present turn.

Not only does the beauty I beheld
Transcend ourselves, but truly I believe
Its maker only may enjoy it all.

Vanquished do I confess me by this passage
More than by problem of his theme was ever
O'r come the comic or the tragic poet;

For as the sun the sight that trembles most,
Even so the memory of that sweet smile
My mind depriveth of its very self.

From the first day that I beheld her face
In this life, to the moment of this look,
The sequence of my song has ne'er been severed;

Source: The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri, translated by Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1891), pp. 145-163.


But now perforce this sequence must desist
From following her beauty with my verse,
As every artist at his uttermost.

Such as I leave her to a greater fame
Than any of my trumpet, which is bringing
Its arduous matter to a final close,

With voice and gesture of a perfect leader
She recommenced: "We from the greatest body
Have issued to the heaven that is pure light;

Light intellectual replete with love,
Love of true good replete with ecstasy,
Ecstasy that transcendeth every sweetness.

Here shalt thou see the one host and the other
Of Paradise, and one in the same aspects
Which at the final judgment thou shalt see."

Even as a sudden lightning that disperses
The visual spirits, so that it deprives
The eye of impress from the strongest objects

Thus round about me flashed a living light,
And left me swathed around with such a view
Of its effulgence, that I nothing saw.

"Ever the Love which quieteth this heaven
Welcomes into itself with such salute,
To make the candle ready for its flame."

No sooner had within me these brief words
An entrance found, than I perceived myself
To be uplifted over my own power,

And I with vision new rekindled me,
Such that no light whatever is so pure
But that mine eyes were fortified against

And light I saw in fashion of a river
Fulvid with its effulgence, 'twixt two banks
Depicted with an admirable Spring.




PARADISE 73

Out of this river issued living sparks,
And on all sides sank down into the flowers,
Like unto rubies that are set in gold;

And then, as if inebriate with the odors,
They plunged again into the wondrous torrent,
And as one entered issued forth another.

"The high desire, that now inflames and moves thee
To have intelligence of what thou seest,
Pleaseth me all the more, the more it swells.

But of this water it behoves thee drink
Before so great a thirst in thee be slaked."
Thus said to me the sunshine of mine eyes;

And added: "The river and the topazes
Going in and out, and the laughing of the herbage,
Are of their truth foreshadowing prefaces;

Not that these things are difficult in themselves,
But the deficiency is on thy side,
For yet thou hast not vision so exalted."

There is no babe that leaps so suddenly
With face towards the milk, if he awake
Much later than his usual custom is,

As I did, that I might make better mirrors
Still of mine eyes, down stooping to the wave
Which flows that we therein be better made.

And even as the penthouse of mine eyelids
Drank of it, it forthwith appeared to me
Out of its length to be transformed to round.

Then as a folk who have been under masks
Seem other than before, if thev divesty /
The semblance not their own they disappeared in,

Thus into greater pomp were changed for me
The flowerets and the sparks, so that I saw
Both of the Courts of Heaven made manifest.



O splendor of God ! by means of which I saw
The lofty triumph of the realm veracious,
Give me the power to say how it I saw !

There is a light above, which visible
Makes the Creator unto every creature,
Who only in beholding Him has peace,

And it expands itself in circular form
To such extent, that its circumference
Would be too large a girdle for the sun.

The semblance of it is all made of rays
Reflected from the top of Primal Motion,
Which takes therefrom vitality and power.

And as a hill in water at its base
Mirrors itself, as if to see its beauty


When affluent most in verdure and in flowers,

So, ranged aloft all round about the light,
Mirrored I saw in more ranks than a thousand
All who above there have from us returned.

And if the lowest row collect within it
So great a light, how vast the amplitude
If of this Rose in its extremest leaves !

My vision in the vastness and the height
Lost not itself, but comprehended all
The quantity and quality of that gladness.

There near and far nor add nor take away;
For there where God immediately doth govern,
The natural law in naught is relevant.

Into the yellow of the Rose Eternal
That spreads, and multiplies, and breathes an odor
Of praise unto the ever-vernal Sun,

As one who silent is and fain would speak,
Me Beatrice drew on, and said: "Behold
Of the white stoles how vast the convent is !



PARADISE 75

Behold how vast the circuit of our city !
Behold our seats so filled to overflowing,
That here henceforward are few people wanting !

On that great throne whereon thine eyes are fixed
For the crown's sake already placed upon it,
Before thou suppest at this wedding feast

Shall sit the soul (that is to be Augustus
On earth) of noble Henry, who shall come
To redress Italy ere she be ready.

Blind covetousness, that casts its spell upon you,
Has made you like unto the little child,
Who dies of hunger and drives off the nurse.

And in the sacred forum then shall be
A Prefect such, that openly or covert
On the same road he will not walk with him.

But long of God he will not be endured
In holy office; he shall be thrust down
Where Simon Magus is for his deserts,

And make him of Alagna lower go!"

CANTO 31

In fashion then as of a snow-white rose

Displayed itself to me the saintly host,
Whom Christ in his own blood had made his bride,

But the other host, that flying sees and sings
The glory of Him who doth enamor it,
And the goodness that created it so noble,

Even as a swarm of bees, that sinks in flowers
One moment, and the next returns again
To where its labor is to sweetness turned,

Sank into the great flower, that is adorned
With leaves so many, and thence reascended
To where its love abideth evermore.



Their faces had they all of living flame,
And wings of gold, and all the rest so white
No snow unto that limit doth attain.

From bench to bench, into the flower descending,
They carried something of the peace and ardor
Which by the fanning of their flanks they won.

Nor did the interposing 'twixt the flower
And what was o'er it of such plenitude
Of flying shapes impede the sight and splendor;

Because the light divine so penetrates
The universe, according to its merit,
That naught can be an obstacle against it.

This realm secure and full of gladsomeness,
Crowded with ancient people and with modern,
Unto one mark had all its look and love.

0 Trinai Light, that in a single star
Sparkling upon their sight so satisfies them,
Look down upon our tempest here below !

If the barbarians, coming from some region
That every day by Helice is covered,
Revolving with her son whom she delights in,

Beholding Rome and all her noble works,
Were wonder-struck, what time the Lateran
Above all mortal things was eminent,

1 who to the divine had from the human,
From time unto eternity, had come,
From Florence to a people just and sane,

With what amazement must I have been filled !

Truly between this and the joy, it was
My pleasure not to hear, and to be mute.

And as a pilgrim who delighteth him
In gazing round the temple of his vow,
And hopes some day to retell how it was,



PARADISE 77

So through the living light my way pursuing
Directed I mine eyes o'er all the ranks,
Now up, now down, and now all round about.

Faces I saw of charity persuasive
Embellished by His light and their own smile,
And attitudes adorned with every grace.

The general form of Paradise already
My glance had comprehended as a whole,
In no part hitherto remaining fixed,

And round I turned me with rekindled wish

My Lady to interrogate of things
Concerning which my mind was in suspense.

One thing I meant, another answered me;
I thought I should see Beatrice, and saw
An Old Man habited like the glorious people.

O'erflowing was he in his eyes and cheeks
With joy benign, in attitude of pity
As to a tender father is becoming.

And "She, where is she?" instantly I said;
Whence he: "To put an end to thy desire,
Me Beatrice hath sent from mine own place.

And if thou lookest up to the third round
Of the first rank, again shalt thou behold her
Upon the throne her merits have assigned her."

Without reply I lifted up mine eyes,
And saw her, as she made herself a crown
Reflecting from herself the eternal rays.

Not from that region which the highest thunders
Is any mortal eye so far removed,
In whatsoever sea it deepest sinks,

As there from Beatrice my sight; but this
Was nothing unto me; because her image
Descended not to me by medium blurred.


"O Lady, thou in whom my hope is strong,
And who for my salvation didst endure
In Hell to leave the imprint of thy feet,

Of whatsoever things I have beheld,
As coming from thy power and from thy goodness
I recognize the virtue and the grace.

Thou from a slave hast brought me unto freedom,
By all those ways, by all the expedients,
Whereby thou hadst the power of doing it.

Preserve towards me thy magnificence,
So that this soul of mine, which thou hast healed,
Pleasing to thee be loosened from the body."

Thus I implored; and she, so far away,
Smiled, as it seemed, and looked once more at me;
Then unto the eternal fountain turned.

And said the Old Man holy: "That thou mayst
Accomplish perfectly thy journeying,
Whereunto prayer and holy love have sent me,

Fly with thine eyes all round about this garden;
For seeing it will discipline thy sight
Farther to mount along the ray divine.

And she, the Queen of Heaven, for whom I burn
Wholly with love, will grant us every grace,
Because that I her faithful Bernard am."

As he who peradventure from Croatia
Cometh to gaze at our Veronica,
Who through its ancient fame is never sated,

But says in thought, the while it is displayed,
"My Lord, Christ Jesus, God of very God,
Now was your semblance made like unto this?"

Even such was I while gazing at the living
Charity of the man, who in this world
By contemplation tasted of that peace.



PARADISE 79

"Thou son of grace, this jocund life," began he,
"Will not be known to thee by keeping ever
Thine eyes below here on the lowest place;

But mark the circles to the most remote,
Until thou shalt behold enthroned the Queen
To whom this realm is subject and devoted."

I lifted up mine eyes, and as at morn
The oriental part of the horizon
Surpasses that wherein the sun goes down,

Thus, as if going with mine eyes from vale
To mount, I saw a part in the remoteness
Surpass in splendor all the other front.

And even as there, where we await the pole
That Phaeton drove badly, blazes more
The light, and is on either side diminished,

So likewise that pacific oriflamme
Gleamed brightest in the centre, and each side
In equal measure did the flame abate.

And at that centre, with their wings expanded,
More than a thousand jubilant Angels saw I,
Each differing in effulgence and in kind.

I saw there at their sports and at their songs
A beauty smiling, which the gladness was
Within the eyes of all the other saints;

And if I had in speaking as much wealth
As in imagining, I should not dare
To attempt the smallest part of its delight.

Bernard, as soon as he beheld mine eyes
Fixed and intent upon its fervid fervor,
His own with such affection turned to her

That it made mine more ardent to behold.


CANTO 32

Absorbed in his delight, that contemplator
Assumed the willing office of a teacher,
And gave beginning to these holy words:

"The wound that Mary closed up and anointed,
She at her feet who is so beautiful,
She is the one who opened it and pierced it.

Within that order which the third seats make
Is seated Rachel, lower than the other,
With Beatrice, in manner as thou seest.

Sarah, Rebecca, Judith, and her who was
Ancestress of the Singer, who for dole
Of the misdeed said, cMiserere mei,'

Canst thou behold from seat to seat descending
Down in gradation, as with each one's name
I through the Rose go down from leaf to leaf.

And downward from the seventh row, even as
Above the same, succeed the Hebrew women,
Dividing all the tresses of the flower;

Because, according to the view which Faith
In Christ hath taken, these are the partition
By which the sacred stairways are divided.

Upon this side, where perfect is the flower
With each one of its petals, seated are
Those who believed in Christ who was to come.

Upon the other side, where intersected
With vacant spaces are the semicircles,
Are those who looked to Christ already come.

And as, upon this side, the glorious seat
Of the Lady of Heaven, and the other seats
Below it, such a great division make,

So opposite doth that of the great John,
Who, ever holy, desert and martyrdom
Endured, and afterwards two years in Hell.



PARADISE 81

And under him thus to divide were chosen

Francis, and Benedict, and Augustine,
And down to us the rest from round to round.

Behold now the high providence divine;
For one and other aspect of the Faith
In equal measure shall this garden fill.

And know that downward from that rank which cleaves

Midway the sequence of the two divisions,
Not by their proper merit are they seated;

But by another's under fixed conditions;
For these are spirits one and all assoiled
Before they any true election had.

Well canst thou recognize it in their faces,
And also in their voices puerile,
If thou regard them well and hearken to them.

Now doubtest thou, and doubting thou art silent;
But I will loosen for thee the strong bond
In which thy subtile fancies hold thee fast.

Within the amplitude of this domain
No casual point can possibly find place,
No more than sadness can, or thirst, or hunger;

For by eternal law has been established
Whatever thou beholdest, so that closely
The ring is fitted to the finger here.

And therefore are these people, festinate
Unto true life, not sine causa here
More and less excellent among themselves.

The King, by means of whom this realm reposes
In so great love and in so great delight
That no will ventureth to ask for more,

In his own joyous aspect every mind
Creating, at his pleasure dowers with grace
Diversely; and let here the effect suffice.


And this is clearly and expressly noted
For you in Holy Scripture, in those twins
Who in their mother had their anger roused.

According to the color of the hair,
Therefore, with such a grace the light supreme
Consenteth that they worthily be crowned.

Without, then, any merit of their deeds,
Stationed are they in different gradations,
Differing only in their first acuteness.

'T is true that in the early centuries,
With innocence, to work out their salvation
Sufficient was the faith of parents only.

After the earlier ages were completed,
Behoved it that the males by circumcision
Unto their innocent wings should virtue add;

But after that the time of grace had come
Without the baptism absolute of Christ,
Such innocence below there was retained.

Look now into the face that unto Christ,
Hath most resemblance; for its brightness only
Is able to prepare thee to see Christ."

On her did I behold so great a gladness
Rain down, borne onward in the holy minds
Created through that altitude to fly,

That whatsoever I had seen before
Did not suspend me in such admiration,
Nor show me such similitude of God.

And the same Love that first descended there,
"Ave Maria y gratia plena" singing,
In front of her his wings expanded wide

Unto the canticle divine responded
From every part the court beatified,
So that each sight became serener for it.


PARADISE 83

"O holy father, who for me endurest
To be below here, leaving the sweet place
In which thou sittest by eternal lot,

Who is the Angel that with so much joy
Into the eyes is looking of our Queen,
Enamored so that he seems made of fire?"

Thus I again recourse had to the teaching
Of that one who delighted him in Mary,
As doth the star of morning in the sun.

And he to me: "Such gallantry and grace
As there can be in Angel and in soul,
All is in him; and thus we fain would have it;

Because he is the one who bore the palm
Down unto Mary, when the Son of God
To take our burden on himself decreed.

But now come onward with thine eyes, as I
Speaking shall go, and note the great patricians
Of this most just and merciful of empires.

Those two that sit above there most enraptured,
As being very near unto Augusta,
Are as it were the two roots of this Rose.

He who upon the left is near her placed
The father is, by whose audacious taste
The human species so much bitter tastes.

Upon the right thou seest that ancient father
Of Holy Church, into whose keeping Christ
The keys committed of this lovely flower.

And he who all the evil days beheld,
Before his death, of her the beauteous bride
Who with the spear and with the nails was won,

Beside him sits, and by the other rests
That leader under whom on manna lived
The people ingrate, fickle, and stiff-necked.


Opposite Peter seest thou Anna seated,
So well content to look upon her daughter,
Her eyes she moves not while she sings Hosanna.

And opposite the eldest household father
Lucia sits, she who thy Lady moved
When to rush downward thou didst bend thy brows.

But since the moments of thy vision fly,
Here will we make full stop, as a good tailor
Who makes the gown according to his cloth,

And unto the first Love will turn our eyes,
That looking upon Him thou penetrate
As far as possible through his effulgence.

Truly, lest peradventure thou recede,
Moving thy wings believing to advance,
By prayer behoves it that grace be obtained;

Grace from that one who has the power to aid thee;
And thou shalt follow me with thy affection
That from my words thy heart turn not aside."

And he began this holy orison.

CANTO 33

"Thou Virgin Mother, daughter of thy Son,
Humble and high beyond all other creature,
The limit fixed of the eternal counsel,

Thou art the one who such nobilitv


To human nature gave, that its Creator
Did not disdain to make himself its creature.

Within thy womb rekindled was the love,
By heat of which in the eternal peace
After such wise this flower has germinated.

Here unto us thou art a noonday torch
Of charity, and below there among mortals
Thou art the living fountain-head of hope.



PARADISE 85

Lady, thou art so great, and so prevailing,
That he who wishes grace, nor runs to thee,
His aspirations without wings would fly.

Not only thy benignity gives succor
To him who asketh it, but oftentimes
Forerunneth of its own accord the asking.

In thee compassion is, in thee is pity,
In thee magnificence; in thee unites
Whate'er of goodness is in any creature.

Now doth this man, who from the lowest depth
Of the universe as far as here has seen
One after one the spiritual lives,

Supplicate thee through grace for so much power
That with his eyes he may uplift himself
Higher towards the uttermost salvation.

And I, who never burned for my own seeing
More than I do for his, all of my prayers
Proffer to thee, and pray they come not short,

That thou wouldst scatter from him every cloud
Of his mortality so with thy prayers,
That the Chief Pleasure be to him displayed.



Still farther do I pray thee, Queen, who canst
Whate'er thou wilt, that sound thou mayst preserve
After so great a vision his affections.

Let thy protection conquer human movements;
See Beatrice and all the blessed ones

My prayers to second clasp their hands to thee !

The eyes beloved and revered of God,
Fastened upon the speaker, showed to us
How grateful unto her are prayers devout;

Then unto the Eternal Light they turned,
On which it is not credible could be

By any creature bent an eye so clear.


And I, who to the end of all desires
Was now approaching, even as I ought
The ardor of desire within me ended.

Bernard was beckoning unto me, and smiling,
That I should upward look; but I already
Was of my own accord such as he wished;

Because my sight, becoming purified,
Was entering more and more into the ray
Of the High Light which of itself is true.

From that time forward what I saw was greater
Than our discourse, that to such vision yields,
And yields the memory unto such excess.

Even as he is who seeth in a dream,
And after dreaming the imprinted passion
Remains, and to his mind the rest returns not,

Even such am I, for almost utterly
Ceases my vision, and distilleth yet
Within my heart the sweetness born of it;

Even thus the snow is in the sun unsealed,
Even thus upon the wind in the light leaves
Were the soothsayings of the Sibyl lost.

O Light Supreme, that dost so far uplift thee
From the conceits of mortals, to my mind
Of what thou didst appear re-lend a little,

And make my tongue of so great puissance,
That but a single sparkle of thy glory
It may bequeath unto the future people;

For by returning to my memory somewhat,
And by a little sounding in these verses,
More of thy victory shall be conceived !

I think the keenness of the living ray
Which I endured would have bewildered me,
If but mine eyes had been averted from it;



PARADISE 87

And I remember that I was more bold
On this account to bear, so that I joined
My aspect with the Glory Infinite.

0 grace abundant, by which I presumed
To fix my sight upon the Light Eternal,
So that the seeing I consumed therein!

1 saw that in its depth far down is lying,
Bound up with love together in one volume,
What through the universe in leaves is scattered;

Substance, and accident, and their operations,
All interfused together in such wise
That what I speak of is one simple light.

The universal fashion of this knot
Methinks I saw, since more abundantly
In saying this I feel that I rejoice.

One moment is more lethargy to me,
Than five and twenty centuries to the emprise
That startled Neptune with the shade of Argo!

My mind in this wise wholly in suspense,
Steadfast, immovable, attentive gazed.
And evermore with gazing grew enkindled.

In presence of that light one such becomes,
That to withdraw therefrom for other prospect
It is impossible he e'er consent;

Because the good, which object is of will,
Is gathered all in this, and out of it
That is defective which is perfect there.

Shorter henceforward will my language fall
Of what I yet remember, than an infant's
Who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast.

Not because more than one unmingled semblance
Was in the living light on which I looked.
For it is always what it was before;

But through the sight, that fortified itself
In me by looking, one appearance only
To me was ever changing as I changed.

Within the deep and luminous subsistence
Of the High Light appeared to me three circles,
Of threefold color and of one dimension,

And by the second seemed the first reflected
As Iris is by Iris, and the third
Seemed fire that equally from both is breathed.

O how all speech is feeble and falls short
Of my conceit, and this to what I saw
Is such, 't is not enough to call it little!

O Light Eterne, sole in thyself that dwellest,
Sole knowest thyself, and, known unto thyself
And knowing, lovest and smilest on thyself!

That circulation, which being thus conceived
Appeared in thee as a reflected light,
When somewhat contemplated by mine eyes,

Within itself, of its own very color
Seemed to me painted with our effigy,
Wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein.

As the geometrician, who endeavors
To square the circle, and discovers not,
By taking thought, the principle he wants,

Even such was I at that new apparition;
I wished to see how the image to the circle
Conformed itself, and how it there finds place;

But my own wings were not enough for this,
Had it not been that then my mind there smote
A flash of lightning, wherein came its wish.

Here vigor failed the lofty fantasy:
But now was turning my desire and will,
Even as a wheel that equally is moved,

The Love which moves the sun and the other stars.



the need for unity and peace 89

De Monarchia

The Need for Unity and Peace
CHAPTER 2

First principles: the goal of human civilization.

First, we must ascertain what temporal Monarchy is in its idea, as I
may say, and in its purpose. Temporal Monarchy, called also the
Empire, we define as a single Principality extending over all peoples in
time, or in those things and over those things which are measured by
time. Concerning it three main questions arise. First, we may ask and
seek to prove whether it is necessary for the well-being of the world;
secondly, whether the Roman people rightfully appropriated the office
of Monarchy; and thirdly, whether the authority of Monarchy derives
from God directly, or from another, a minister or vicar of God.

But as every truth which is not a first principle is manifested by the
truth of some first principle, it is necessary in every investigation to know
the first principle to which we may return, in analysis, for the proof of
all propositions which are subsequently assumed. And as the present
treatise is an investigation, we must before all else search out a basic
principle, on the validity of which will depend whatever follows. Be
it known, therefore, that certain things exist which are not at all sub
ject to our control, and which we can merely speculate upon, but can
not cause to be or to do: such are mathematics, physics, and divinity.
On the other hand, certain things exist which are subject to our con
trol, and which are matter not only for speculation, but for execution.
In these things the action is not performed for the sake of the specula
tion, but the latter for the sake of the former, because in them action is
the end. Since the matter under consideration is governmental, nay,
is the very source and first principle of right governments, and since
everything governmental is subject to our control, it is clear that our
present theme is primarily adapted for action rather than for specula
tion. Again, since the first principle and cause of all actions is their
ultimate end, and since the ultimate end first puts the agent in motion,
it follows that the entire procedure of the means toward an end must
derive from the end itself. For the manner of cutting wood to build a
house will be other than that of cutting wood to build a ship. So if there
exists an end for universal government among men, that end will be the
basic principle through which all things to be proved hereafter may be
demonstrated satisfactorily. But to believe that there is an end for this


government and for that government, and that there is no single end
common to all, would indeed be irrational.

Source: The De Monarchia of Dante Alighieri, translated by Aurelia Henry (Boston:
Houghton Mifflin Co., 1904), pp. 5-8, 14-21, 40-46, 135-137, 140-156, 161-181,
183-187, 196-206.





CHAPTER 4

The best means toward this end is universal peace.

It has now been satisfactorily explained that the proper function of the
human race, taken in the aggregate, is to actualize continually the
entire capacity of the possible intellect, primarily in speculation, then,
through its extension and for its sake, secondarily in action. And since
it is true that whatever modifies a part modifies the whole, and that the
individual man seated in quiet grows perfect in knowledge and wisdom,
it is plain that amid the calm and tranquillity of peace the human race
accomplishes most freely and easily its given work. How nearly divine
this function is revealed in the words, "Thou hast made him a little
lower than the angels." Whence it is manifest that universal peace is
the best of those things which are ordained for our beatitude. And
hence to the shepherds sounded from on high the message not of riches,
nor pleasures, nor honors, nor length of life, nor health, nor beauty; but
the message of peace. For the heavenly host said, "Glory to God in the
highest, and on earth peace among men in whom he is well pleased."
Likewise, " Peace be unto you" was the salutation of the Saviour of
men. It befitted the supreme Saviour to utter the supreme saluta
tion. It is evident to all that the disciples desired to preserve this cus
tom; and Paul likewise in his words of greeting.

From these things which have been expounded we perceive through
what better, nay, through what best means the human race may fulfill
its proper office. Consequently we perceive the nearest way through
which may be reached that universal peace toward which all our efforts
are directed as their ultimate end, and which is to be assumed as the
basic principle of subsequent reasoning. This principle was necessary,
we have said, as a predetermined formula, into which, as into a most
manifest truth, must be resolved all things needing to be proved.

CHAPTER 5

To achieve this state of universal well-being, a single
world government is necessary.

Resuming what was said in the beginning, I repeat, there are three
main questions asked and debated in regard to temporal Monarchy,
which is more commonly termed the Empire, and it is my purpose to
make inquiry concerning these in the order cited, according to the
principle now enunciated. And so let the first question be whether
temporal Monarchy is necessary for the well-being of the world. The
necessity of temporal Monarchy can be gainsaid with no force of reason
or authority, and can be proved by the most powerful and patent argu
ments, of which the first is taken on the testimony of the Philosopher in
the Politics. There this venerable authority asserts that when several
things are ordained for one end, one of them must regulate or rule,



THE NEED FOR UNITY AND PEACE 91

and the others submit to regulation or rule. This, indeed, not only be
cause of the author's glorious name, but because of inductive reason
ing, demands credence.

If we consider the individual man, we shall see that this applies to
him, for, when all his faculties are ordered for his happiness, the intel
lectual faculty itself is regulator and ruler of all others; in no way else
can man attain to happiness. If we consider the household, whose end
is to teach its members to live rightly, there is need for one called the
pater-familias, or for some one holding his place, to direct and govern,
according to the Philosopher when he says, "Every household is ruled
by its eldest." It is for him, as Homer says, to guide and make laws
for those dwelling with him. From this arises the proverbial curse,
"May you have an equal in your house." If we consider the village,
whose aim is adequate protection of persons and property, there is
again needed for governing the rest either one chosen for them by
another, or one risen to preeminence from among themselves by their
consent; otherwise, they not only obtain no mutual support, but
sometimes the whole community is destroyed by many striving for first
place. Again, if we consider the city, whose end is to insure comfort and
sufficiency in life, there is need for undivided rule in rightly directed
governments, and in those wrongly directed as well; else the end of civil
life is missed, and the city ceases to be what it was. Finally, if we con
sider the individual kingdom, whose end is that of the city with greater
promise of tranquillity, there must be one king to direct and govern.
If not, not only the inhabitants of the kingdom fail of their end, but the
kingdom lapses into ruin, in agreement with that word of infallible
truth, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation."
If, then, this is true of these instances, and of all things ordained for a
single end, it is true of the statement assumed above.

We are now agreed that the whole human race is ordered for one end,
as already shown. It is meet, therefore, that the leader and lord be one,
and that he be called Monarch, or Emperor. Thus it becomes obvious
that for the well-being of the world there is needed a Monarchy, or
Empire.

CHAPTER 12

Human freedom is only possible under world government.
If the principle of freedom is explained, it will be apparent that the
human race is ordered for the best when it is most free. Observe, then,
those words which are on the lips of many but in the minds of few, that
the basic principle of our freedom is freedom of the will. Men come
even to the point of saying that free will is free judgment in matters of
will, and they say true; but the import of their words is far from them,
as from our logicians who work daily with certain propositions used as


examples in books of logic; for instance, that "a triangle has three
angles equaling two right angles."

Judgment, I affirm, stands between apprehension and desire; for
first a thing is apprehended; then the apprehension is adjudged good
or bad; and finally he who so judges pursues or avoids it. So if judg
ment entirely controls desire, and is hindered by it in no way, judg
ment is free; but if desire influences judgment by hindering it in some
manner, judgment cannot be free, for it acts not of itself, but is dragged
captive by another. Thus brutes cannot have free judgment, for their
judgments are always hindered by appetite. And thus intellectual sub
stances whose wills are immutable, and disembodied souls who have
departed in peace, do not lose freedom of the will by reason of this im
mutability, but retain it in greatest perfection and power.

With this in mind we may understand that this freedom, or basic
principle of our freedom, is, as I said, the greatest gift bestowed by God
upon human nature, for through it we attain to joy here as men, and
to blessedness there as gods. If this is so, who will not admit that man
kind is best ordered when able to use this principle most effectively?
But the race is most free under a Monarch. Wherefore let us know that
the Philosopher holds in his book concerning simple Being, that whatever
exists for its own sake and not for the sake of another is free. For what
ever exists for the sake of another is conditioned by that other, as a road
by its terminus. Only if a Monarch rules can the human race exist for
its own sake; only if a Monarch rules can the crooked policies be straight
ened, namely democracies, oligarchies, and tyrannies which force man
kind into slavery, as he sees who goes among them, and under which
kings, aristocrats called the best men, and zealots of popular libery play
at politics. For since a Monarch loves men greatly, a point already
touched upon, he desires all men to do good, which cannot be among
players at crooked policies. Whence the Philosopher in his Politics says,
"Under bad government the good man is a bad citizen; but under up
right government 'good man' and 'good citizen' have the same mean
ing." Upright governments have liberty as their aim, that men may
live for themselves; not citizens for the sake of the consuls, nor a people
for a king, but conversely, consuls for the sake of the citizens, and a king
for his people. As governments are not all established for the sake of
laws, but laws for governments, so those living under the laws are not
ordered for the sake of the legislator, but rather he for them, as the
Philosopher maintains in what he has left us concerning the present
matter. Wherefore it is also evident that although consul or king may
be lord of others with respect to means of governing, they are servants
with respect to the end of governing; and without doubt the Monarch
must be held the chief servant of all. Now it becomes clear that a Mon
arch is conditioned in the making of laws by his previously determined


TEMPORAL RULE COMES FROM GOD NOT THE PAPACY 93

end. Therefore the human race existing under a Monarch is best
ordered, and from this it follows that a Monarchy is essential to the
well-being of the world.

Temporal Rule Comes from God Not the Papacy
CHAPTER 1

The doctrine of this book is offensive to the papacy.

"He has shut the lions' mouths and they have not hurt me; inasmuch
as before Him righteousness was found in me." In beginning this work
I proposed to investigate three questions as far as the subject-matter
would allow. For the first two questions this has been done satisfactor
ily in the foregoing books, I believe. We must now consider the third,
the truth of which may, however, be a cause of indignation against me,
since it cannot be brought forth without causing certain men to blush.
But since Truth from her immutable throne demands it; and Solomon
entering his forest of Proverbs, and marking out his own conduct, en
treats that we "meditate upon truth and abhor wickedness;" and our
teacher of morals, the Philosopher, admonishes us to sacrifice whatever
is most precious for truth's sake: therefore, gaining assurance from the
words of Daniel, wherein the power of God is shown as a shield for de
fenders of truth, and "putting on the breastplate of faith" according to
the admonition of Paul, in the warmth of that coal taken from the
heavenly altar by one of the Seraphim and touched to the lips of Isaiah,
I will engage in the present conflict, and by the arm of Him who with
His blood liberated us from the power of darkness, I will cast the un
godly and the liar from the arena, while the world looks on. Where
fore should I fear, when the Spirit, co-eternal with the Father and the
Son, says by the mouth of David, "The righteous shall be in everlasting
remembrance, he shall not be afraid of evil tidings"?

The question pending investigation, then, concerns two great lumi
naries, the Roman Pontiff and the Roman Prince: and the point at issue
is whether the authority of the Roman Monarch, who, as proved in the
second book, is rightful Monarch of the world, derives from God
directly, or from some vicar or minister of God, by whom I mean the
successor of Peter, veritable keeper of the keys of the kingdom of heaven.

CHAPTER 3

The authority of the church does not rest on tradition.
In entering on this third question, let us bear in mind that the truth
of the first was made manifest in order to abolish ignorance rather
than contention. But the investigation of the second had reference
alike to ignorance and contention. Indeed, we are ignorant of many
things concerning which we do not contend: the geometrician does


not know the square of the circle, but he does not contend about it;
the theologian does not know the number of the angels, but he renders
it no cause for quarrel; the Egyptian knows naught of the civilization
of Scythia, but does not therefore make the civilization a source of strife.

Now the truth of the third question has to do with so keen a conten
tion that, whereas ignorance generally causes the discord, here the
discord causes ignorance. For it always happens to men who will things
before rationally considering them that, their desire being evil, they
put behind them the light of reason; as blind men they are led about by
their desire, and stubbornly deny their blindness. Whence it often
occurs not only that falsehood has her own patrimony, but that many
men going out from her boundaries run through strange camps, where,
neither understanding nor being understood at all, they provoke some
to wrath, some to disdain, and not a few to laughter.

Three classes of men struggle hardest against the truth which we
would establish.

First the Chief Pontiff, Vicar of our Lord Jesus Christ and successor
to Peter, he to whom we should render not what is due to Christ but
what is due to Peter, he, perchance in his zeal for the keys, together
with some pastors of Christian flocks, and others moved solely, I be
lieve, by their zeal for Mother Church, contradict the truth I am about
to declare. They contradict it, perchance, from zeal, I repeat, not
from pride.

But others in their inveterate cupidity have quenched the light of
reason, and call themselves sons of the Church, although they are of
their father the devil. Not only do they arouse controversy in regard
to this question, but, despising the very name of the most sacred Prince-
hood, impudently deny the first principles of this and the previous
questions.

The third class, called Decretalists, utterly ignorant and unregardful
of Theology and Philosophy, depending entirely on the Decretals
(which, I grant, are deserving of veneration), and I presume trusting
in the ultimate supremacy of these, derogate from the imperial power.
Nor is it to be wondered at, for I have heard one of them aver and inso
lently maintain that ecclesiastical traditions are the foundation of faith.
Let those dispel this error of thought from mortal minds whom the
world doubts not to have believed in Christ, the Son of God, ere ecclesi
astical traditions were, believed in Him either to come, or present, or
having already suffered, and believing hoped, and hoping burned with
love, and burning with love were made co-heirs with Him.

And that such mistaken thinkers may be wholly shut out from the
present discussion, it must be observed that some of the Scriptures take
precedence of the Church, some are equivalent to the Church, and some
subordinate to it.

Those taking precedence of the Church are the Old and New Testa-



TEMPORAL RULE COMES FROM GOD NOT THE PAPACY 95

ments, which, as the Prophet says, "were commanded for ever," and to
which the Church refers in saying to the Bridegroom, "Draw me
after thee."

Equivalent to the Church are those Councils so worthy of reverence,
and in the midst of which no believer doubts the presence of Christ; for
we have, according to Matthew's testimony, the words spoken to His
disciples at His ascension into heaven: "Lo, I am with you always,
even unto the end of the world." In addition, there are the writings of
the Doctors, Augustine, and others, and whosoever doubts the aid of the
Holy Spirit therein has never seen their fruits, or if he has seen, has
never tasted them.

Subordinate to the Church are the traditions called Decretals, which,
while they must be revered for their apostolic authority, must neverthe
less be held unquestionably inferior to the fundamental Scriptures, see
ing that Christ rebuked the priests for not so doing. When they had
inquired, "Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?"
(for they had omitted the washing of hands) Christ answered, as
Matthew testifies, "Why do ye also transgress the commandment of
God by your tradition?" Here the inferiority of tradition is clearly
implied.

If, as we believe, traditions of the Church are subordinate to the
Church, authority necessarily accrues not to the Church through tra
ditions, but to traditions through the Church. And I repeat, those who
have faith in traditions alone are excluded from this discussion. For

they who would hunt down this truth must start in their search from
those writings whence the authority of the Church emanates.

Others must likewise be excluded who, decked in the plumage of
ravens, boast themselves white sheep of the Master's flock. In order to
carry out their crimes, these sons of impiety defile their mother, banish
their brethren, and scorn judgments brought against them. Why
should reason be sought in behalf of these whose passions prevent them
from understanding our basic principle?

There remains, then, the controversy with those only who, led by a
certain zeal for their Mother the Church, are blind to the truth we are
seeking. And with them, confident in that reverence which a loyal and
loving son owes to father and mother, to Christ and the Church, to the
Shepherd and all who profess the Christian religion, I enter in this book
into combat for the preservation of truth.

CHAPTER 4

The analogy of sun and moon is not applicable
to temporal authority.
Those men to whom the entire subsequent discussion is directed
assert that the authority of the Empire depends on the authority of the
Church, just as the inferior artisan depends on the architect. They are


drawn to this by divers opposing arguments, some of which they take
from Holy Scripture, and some from certain acts performed by the
Chief Pontiff, and by the Emperor himself; and they endeavor to make
their conviction reasonable.

For, first, they maintain that according to Genesis God made two
mighty luminaries, a greater and a less, the former to hold supremacy
by day and the latter by night. These they interpret allegorically to be
the two rulersspiritual and temporal. Whence they argue that as the
lesser luminary, the moon, has no light but that gained from the sun,
so the temporal ruler has no authority but that gained from the spiritual
ruler.

Let it be noted for the refutation of this and their other arguments
that, as the Philosopher holds in his writings on Sophistry, "the destruc
tion of an argument is the exposure of error." And because error can
occur in both the matter and the form of an argument, a two-fold
fallacy is possiblethat arising from a false assumption, and that from a
failure to syllogize. The two objections brought by the Philosopher
against Parmenides and Melissus were: "They accept what is false, and
syllogize incorrectly." "False" I use here with large significance, em
bracing the improbable, which in matters of probability becomes the
false element. He who would destroy a conclusion where there is error
in the form of the argument must show a failure to comply with the
rules of syllogizing. Where the error is material, he must show that an
assumption has been made, either false in itself, or false in relation to
something else. Absolute falsity may be destroyed by destroying the
assumption, relative falsity by distinction of meanings.

Granting this, let us observe, in order to comprehend more clearly
the fallacy of this and other arguments, that with regard to mystical
interpretation a twofold error may arise, either by seeking one where it
is not, or by explaining it other than it ought to be.

Of the first error Augustine says in The City of God: "Not all deeds
recounted should be thought to have special significance, because for
the sake of significant things insignificant details are interwoven. The
plowshare by itself cuts the land into furrows, but that this may be
accomplished the other parts of the plow are needed."

Of the second error he speaks in his Christian Doctrine, saying that the
man who attempts to find in the Scriptures other things than the
writer's meaning "is deceived as one who abandons a certain road, only
by a long detour to reach the goal whither the road led directly." And
he adds, "Such a man should be shown that a habit of leaving his path
may lead him into cross-roads and tortuous ways." Then he gives the
reason why this error should be avoided in the Scriptures, saying,
"Shake the authority of the divine writings, and you shake all faith."
However, I believe that when such errors are due to ignorance they
should be pardoned after correction has been carefully administered,


TEMPORAL RULE COMES FROM GOD NOT THE PAPACY 97

just as he should be pardoned who is terrified at a supposed lion in the
clouds. But when such errors are due to design, the erring one should
be treated like tyrants who never apply public laws for the general wel
fare, but endeavor to turn them to individual profit.

O unparalleled crime, though committed but in dreams, of turning
into evil the intention of the Eternal Spirit! Such a sin would not be
against Moses, or David, or Job, or Matthew, or Paul, but against the
Holy Spirit that speaketh in them. For although the writers of the
divine word are many, the dictator of the word is one, even God, who
has deigned to make known his purpose to us through divers pens.

From these prefatory remarks I proceed to refute the above assump
tion that the two luminaries of the world typify its two ruling powers.
The whole force of their argument lies in the interpretation; but this
we can prove indefensible in two ways. First, since these ruling powers
are as it were accidents necessitated by man himself, God would seem to
have used a distorted order in creating first accidents, and then the
subject necessitating them. It is absurd to speak thus of God, but it is
evident from the Word that the two lights were created on the fourth
day, and man on the sixth.

Secondly, the two ruling powers exist as the directors of men toward
certain ends, as will be shown further on; but had man remained in
the state of innocence in which God made him, he would have required
no such direction. These ruling powers are therefore remedies against
the infirmity of sin. Since on the fourth day man not only was not a
sinner, but was not even existent, the creation of a remedy would have
been purposeless, which is contrary to divine goodness. Foolish indeed
would be the physician who should make ready a plaster for the future
abscess of a man not yet born. Therefore it cannot be asserted that
God made the two ruling powers on the fourth day; and consequently
the meaning of Moses cannot have been what it is supposed to be.

Also, in order to be tolerant, we may refute this fallacy by distinction.
Refutation by distinction deals more gently with an adversary, for it
shows him to be not absolutely wrong, as does refutation by destruction.
I say, then, that although the moon may have abundant light only as
she receives it from the sun, it does not follow on that account that the
moon herself owes her existence to the sun. It must be recognized that
the essence of the moon, her strength, and her function are not one
and the same thing. Neither in her essence, her strength, nor her func
tion taken absolutely, does the moon owe her existence to the sun, for
her movement is impelled by her own motor and her influence by her
own rays. Besides, she has a certain light of her own, as is shown in
eclipse. It is in order to fulfill her function better and more potently
that she borrows from the sun abundance of light, and works thereby
more efficaciously.

In like manner, I say, the temporal power receives from the spiritual




neither its existence, nor its strength, which is its authority, nor even its
function taken absolutely. But well for her does she receive therefrom,
through the light of grace which the benediction of the Chief Pontiff
sheds upon it in heaven and on earth, strength to fulfill her function
more perfectly. So the argument was at fault in form, because the
predicate of the conclusion is not a term of the major premise, as is
evident. The syllogism runs thus: The moon receives light from the sun,
which is the spiritual power; the temporal ruling power is the moon;
therefore the temporal receives authority from the spiritual. They
introduce "light" as the term of the major, but "authority" as predi
cate of the conclusion, which two things we have seen to be diverse in
subject and significance.

CHAPTER 7

Refutation of papal claims.

From the book of Matthew they also cite the oblation of the Magi,
claiming that Christ accepted both frankincense and gold, in order to
signify that He was Lord and Governor of the spiritual and temporal
domains. They draw as inference from this that the Vicar of Christ is
lord and governor of these realms, and consequently has authority
over both.

In answering this I grant the text of Matthew and their interpreta
tion, but the inference they try to draw from it is false through deficiency
in the terms. Their syllogism is this: God is Lord of the spiritual and
temporal domains; the Pope is the Vicar of God; therefore he is lord of
the spiritual and temporal domains. While each proposition is true, the
middle term is changed to admit four terms to the argument, thereby
impairing the syllogistic form. This is plain from the writings on Syllogiz
ing considered simply. For one term is "God," the subject of the major
premise, and the other term is "Vicar of God," the predicate of the
minor.

And if any one insists on the equivalence of God and Vicar, his in
sistence is useless, for no vicar, divine or human, can be coordinate
with His authority, as is easily seen. And we know that the successor of
Peter is not coequal with divine power, at least not in the operation of
nature. He could not by virtue of the office committed to him make
earth rise up, or fire fall. It is impossible that God should have intrusted
all things to him, for God was in no way able to delegate the power of
creation or of baptism, as is plainly proved despite the contrary state
ment of the Master in his fourth book.

We know, too, that a man's deputy, in so far as he is a deputy, is
not of coordinate power with him, because no one can bestow what does
not belong to him. Princely authority belongs to a prince only for his
employment, since no prince can authorize himself; he has power to


receive and to reject it, but no power to create it in another, seeing that
the creation of a prince is not effected by a prince. If this is true, it is
evident that no prince can substitute for himself a regent equal in all
things to himself. Wherefore the protest is of no avail.

CHAPTER 8

From the same gospel they quote the saying of Christ to Peter, "What
soever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven," and under
stand this saying to refer alike to all the Apostles, according to the text
of Matthew and John. They reason from this that the successor of
Peter has been granted of God power to bind and loose all things, and
then infer that he has power to loose the laws and decrees of the Empire,
and to bind the laws and decrees of the temporal kingdom. Were this
true, their inference would be correct.

But we must reply to it by making a distinction against the major
premise of the syllogism which they employ. Their syllogism is this:
Peter had power to bind and loose all things; the successor of Peter has
like power with him; therefore the successor of Peter has power to loose
and bind all things. From this they infer that he has power to loose and
bind the laws and decrees of the Empire.

I concede the minor premise, but the major only with distinction.
Wherefore I say that "all," the symbol of the universal, which is implied
in "whatsoever," is never distributed beyond the scope of the distrib
uted term. When I say, "All animals run," the distribution of "all"
comprehends whatever comes under the genus "animal." But when
I say, "All men run," the symbol of the universal only refers to what
ever comes under the term "man." And when I say, "All grammarians
run," the distribution is narrowed still further.

Therefore we must always determine what it is over which the symbol
of the universal is distributed; then, from the recognized nature and
scope of the distributed term, will be easily apparent the extent of the
distribution. Now, were "whatsoever" to be understood absolutely
when it is said, "Whatsoever thou shalt bind," he would certainly
have the power they claim; nay, he would have even greater power, he
would be able to loose a wife from her husband, and, while the man
still lived, bind her to anothera thing he can in no wise do. He
would be able to absolve me, while impenitenta thing which God
himself cannot do.

So it is evident that the distribution of the term under discussion is
to be taken, not absolutely, but relatively to something else. A con
sideration of the concession to which the distribution is subjoined will
make manifest this related something. Christ said to Peter, "I will give
unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven;" that is, I will make thee
doorkeeper of the kingdom of heaven. Then he adds, "and whatso-


ever," that is, "everything which," and He means thereby, "Every
thing which pertains to that office thou shalt have power to bind and
loose." And thus the symbol of the universal which is implied in "what
soever" is limited in its distribution to the prerogative of the keys of the
kingdom of heaven. Understood thus, the proposition is true, but
understood absolutely, it is obviously not. Therefore I conclude that
although the successor of Peter has authority to bind and loose in ac
cordance with the requirements of the prerogative granted to Peter, it
does not follow, as they claim, that he has authority to bind and loose
the decrees or statutes of Empire, unless they prove that this also belongs
to the office of the keys. But we shall demonstrate farther on that the
contrary is true.

CHAPTER 9

They quote also the words in Luke which Peter addressed to Christ,
saying, "Behold, here are two swords," and they assert that the two
ruling powers were predicted by those two swords, and because Peter
declared they were "where he was," that is, "with him," they conclude
that according to authority these two ruling powers abide with Peter's
successor.

To refute this we must show the falsity of the interpretation on which
the argument is based. Their assertion that the two swords which Peter
designated signify the two ruling powers before spoken of, we deny out
right, because such an answer would have been at variance with
Christ's meaning, and because Peter replied in haste, as usual, with
regard to the mere external significance of things.

A consideration of the words preceding it and of the cause of the
words will show that such an answer would have been inconsistent
with Christ's meaning. Let it be called to mind that this response was
made on the day of the feast, which Luke mentions earlier, saying,
"Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be
killed." At this feast Christ had already foretold His impending passion,
in which He must be parted from His disciples. Let it be remembered
also that when these words were uttered, all the twelve disciples were
together; wherefore a little after the words just quoted Luke says, "And
when the hour was come, He sat down, and the twelve Apostles with
him." Continuing the discourse from this place he reaches the words,
"When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any
thing?" And they answered, "Nothing." Then said He unto them,
"But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip:
and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one." The
meaning of Christ is clear enough here. He did not say, "Buy or pro
cure two swords," but "twelve;" for it was in order that each of the
twelve disciples might have one that He said to them, "He that hath no


sword, let him buy one." And He spake thus to forewarn them of the
persecution and contempt the future should bring, as though he would
say, "While I was with you ye were welcomed, now shall ye be turned
away. It behooves you, therefore, to prepare for yourselves those things
which before I denied to you, but for which there is present need." If
Peter's reply to these words had carried the meaning ascribed to it, the
meaning would have been at variance with that of Christ, and Christ
would have censured Him, as he did oftentimes, for his witless answers.
However, He did not do so, but assented, saying to him, "It is enough,"
meaning, "I speak because of necessity; but if each cannot have a
sword, two will suffice."

And that Peter usually spoke of the external significance of things is
shown in his quick and unthinking presumption, impelled, I believe,
not only by the sincerity of his faith, but by the purity and simplicity of
his nature. To this characteristic presumption all those who write of
Christ bear witness.

First, Matthew records that when Jesus had inquired of the disciples:
"Whom say ye that I am?" before all the others Peter replied, "Thou
art Christ, the Son of the living God." He also records that when Christ
was telling His disciples how He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many
things, Peter took Him and began to rebuke Him, saying, "Be it far
from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee." Then Christ, turning to
him, said in reproof, "Get thee behind me, Satan." Matthew also writes
that on the Mount of Transfiguration, in the presence of Christ, Moses,
and Elias, and the two sons of Zebedee, Peter said, "Lord, it is good for
us to be here. If thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for
thee, one for Moses, and one for Elias." Matthew further writes that
when the disciples were on the ship in the night, and Christ walked on
the water, Peter said, "Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on
the water." And that when Christ predicted how all His disciples
should be offended because of Him, Peter answered, "Though all men
shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended." And
afterwards, "Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee."
And this statement Mark confirms, while Luke writes that, just before
the words we have quoted concerning the swords, Peter had said to
Christ, "Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison and to
death."

John tells of him, that when Christ desired to wash his feet, Peter
asked, "Lord, dost thou wash my feet?" and then said, "Thou shalt
never wash my feet." He further relates how Peter smote with his
sword the servant of the High Priest, an account in which the four
Evangelists agree. AndJohn tells how when Peter came to the sepulchre
and saw the other disciples lingering at the door, he entered in straight
way; and again when after the resurrection Jesus stood on the shore and


Peter "heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him (for
he was naked), and did cast himself into the sea." Lastly, he recounts
that when Peter saw John, he said to Jesus, "Lord, and what shall this
man do?"

It is a source of joy to have summed up this evidence of our Head
Shepherd, in praise of his singleness of purpose. From all this it is obvi
ous that when he spoke of the two swords, his answer to Christ was un
ambiguous in meaning.

Even if the words of Christ and Peter are to be accepted typically,
they cannot be interpreted in the sense these men claim, but rather as
referring to the sword concerning which Matthew writes: "Think not
that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a
sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father," and
what follows. This He accomplished in word and deed, wherefore Luke
tells Theophilus of all "that Jesus began to do and teach." Such was the
sword Christ enjoined them to buy, and Peter made answer that already
they had two with them. As we have shown, they were ready for words
and for works to bring to pass those things which Christ proclaimed He
had come to do by the sword.

CHAPTER 1 0

In addition, some persons affirm that the Emperor Constantine, healed
of leprosy by the intercession of Sylvester, then the Supreme Pontiff,
gave to the Church the very seat of Empire, Rome, together with many
imperial dignities. Wherefore they argue that no one has power to
assume these dignities except he receives them from the Church, to
whom it is asserted they belong. And from this it would fairly follow,
as they desire, that one authority is dependent on the other.

So having stated and refuted the arguments which seemed to be
rooted in divine communications, it now remains to set forth and dis
prove those rooted in Roman deeds and human reason. We have just
spoken of the first of these, whose syllogism runs thus: Those things
which belong to the Church no one can rightly possess, unless granted
them by the Church; and this we concede. The ruling power of Rome
belongs to the Church; therefore no one can rightly possess it unless
granted it by the Church. And the minor premise they prove by the
facts mentioned above concerning Constantine.

This minor premise, then, I deny. Their proof is no proof, for Con
stantine had not the power to alienate the imperial dignity, nor had the
Church power to receive it. Their insistent objection to what I say can
be met thus. No one is free to do through an office assigned him any
thing contrary to the office, for thereby the same thing, in virtue of being
the same, would be contrary to itself, which is impossible. But to divide


the Empire would be contrary to the office assigned the Emperor, for
as is easily seen from the first book of the treatise, his office is to hold the
human race subject to one will in all things. Therefore, division of his
Empire is not allowed an Emperor. If, as they claim, certain dignities
were alienated by Constantine from the Empire and ceded to the power
of the Church, the "seamless coat" would have been rent, which even
they had not dared to mutilate who with their spears pierced Christ,
the very God. Moreover, as the Church has its own foundation, so has
the Empire its own. The foundation of the Church is Christ, as the
Apostle writes to the Corinthians: "Other foundation can no man lay
than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ." He is the rock on which the
Church is founded, but the foundation of the Empire is human Right.
Now I say that as the Church cannot act contrary to its foundation, but
must be supported thereby, according to that verse of the Canticles:
"Who is she that cometh up from the desert, abounding in delights,
leaning on her beloved?" so the Empire cannot act in conflict with
human Right. Therefore the Empire may not destroy itself, for, should
it do so, it would act in conflict with human Right. Inasmuch as the
Empire consists in the indivisibility of universal Monarchy, and inas
much as an apportionment of the Empire would destroy it, it is evident
that division is not allowed to him who discharges imperial duty. And
it is proved, from what has been previously said, that to destroy the
Empire would be contrary to human Right.

Besides, every jurisdiction exists prior to its judge, since the judge is
ordained for the jurisdiction, and not conversely. As the Empire is a
jurisdiction embracing in its circuit the administration of justice in all
temporal things, so it is prior to its judge, who is Emperor; and the
Emperor is ordained for it, and not conversely. Clearly the Emperor, as
Emperor, cannot alter the Empire, for from it he receives his being and
state. So I say, either he was Emperor when he made the concession
they speak of to the Church, or he was not. If he was not, it is plain
that he had no power to grant anything with regard to the Empire.
And if he was, then as Emperor he could not have done this, for the con
cession would have narrowed his jurisdiction.

Further, if one Emperor has power to cut away one bit from the juris
diction of the Empire, another may do the same for like reason. And
since temporal jurisdiction is finite, and every finite thing may be con
sumed by finite losses, the possibility of annihilating primal jurisdiction
would follow. But this is inconceivable.

And since he who confers a thing has the relation of agent, and he on
whom it is conferred the relation of patient, according to the Philoso
pher in the fourth book to Nicomachus, then in order for a grant to be
legal, proper qualification is essential not only in the giver, but in the


recipient. Indeed, it seems that the acts of agents exist potentially in a
properly qualified patient. But the Church was utterly disqualified for
receiving temporal power by the express prohibitive command in
Matthew: "Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,
nor scrip for your journey," etc. For although we learn from Luke of
the mitigation of this order regarding certain things, yet I am unable to
find that sanction was given the Church to possess gold and silver, sub
sequent to the prohibition. Wherefore if the Church had not power to
receive, even had Constantine power to bestow, temporal authority,
the action would nevertheless be impossible, because of the disqualifi
cation of the patient. It is demonstrated, then, that neither could the
Church accept by way of possession, nor could Constantine confer by
way of alienation. However, the Emperor did have power to depute to
the protectorship of the Church a patrimony and other things, as long
as his supreme command, the unity of which suffers no impairment,
remained unchanged. And the Vicar of God had power to receive such
things, not for possession, but for distribution on behalf of the Church
of its fruits to the poor of Christ. We are not ignorant that thus the
Apostles did.

CHAPTER 12

Papal and imperial powers cannot be represented by
one man.

Their argument from reason, however, is this. They lay down the
principle advanced in the tenth book of the First Philosophy, that "all
things of one genus are reducible to a type which is the standard of
measurement for all within the genus." Since all men are of one genus,
they ought to be reducible to a type as a standard for all others. And
since the Supreme Pontiff and the Emperor are men, they must there
fore, if our conclusion is true, be reducible to one man. And since the
Pope cannot be subordinated to another, it remains for the Emperor
and all others to be subordinated to the Pope as their measure and
rule; whence results the conclusion they desire.

That this reasoning may be invalidated, I agree that their statement
is true that all things of one genus ought to be reduced to some one
member of that genus as a standard of measurement. Likewise is it true
that all men are of one genus. Also is true their conclusion drawn from
these that all men ought to be subordinated to one standard for the
genus. But when from this conclusion they draw the further inference
concerning Pope and Emperor, they deceive themselves with the fallacy
of accidental attributes.

To make this evident, be it known that it is one thing to be a man
and another thing to be a Pope. And just so it is one thing to be a man

and another thing to be an Emperor, as it is one thing to be a man and
another to be a father or master. Man is man because of his substantial

form, which is the determinant of his species and genus, and which
places him under the category of substance. But a father is such be
cause of an accidental form, that of relation, which is the determinant
of a certain species and genus, and which places him under the category
of relation. Otherwise everything would be reduced to the category of
substance, since no accidental form exists in itself, apart from the basis
of underlying substance. But this is false. Therefore since the Pope and
Emperor are what they are because of certain relations, the former
through the Papacy, a relation in the province of fatherhood, and the
latter through the Empire, a relation in the province of government,
it is manifest that the Pope and the Emperor, in so far as they are such,
must have place under the category of relation, and consequently must
be subordinated to something in that genus.

Whence, I repeat, they are to be measured by one standard in so far
as they are men, and by another in so far as they are Pope and Em
peror. Now, in so far as they are men, they have to be measured by the
best man (whoever he may be), that is, by him who is the standard
and ideal of all men, and who has the most perfect unity among his
kind, as we may learn from the last book to Nicomachus. But in as far as
they are relative, it is evident that one must be measured by the other,
if one is subordinate; or they must unite in a common species from the
nature of their relation; or they must be measured by a third something
as their common ground of unity. But it cannot be maintained that one
is subordinate to the other; that is, it is false to predicate one of the
other, to call the Emperor the Pope, or to call the Pope the Emperor.
Nor is it possible to maintain that they unite in a common species, for
the relation of Pope, as such, is other than the relation of Emperor as
Emperor. Therefore they must be measured by something beyond
themselves in which they shall find a ground of unity.

At this point it must be understood that as relation stands to relation,
so stands related thing to related thing. Hence if the Papacy and Em
pire, being relations of authority, must be measured with regard to the
supreme authority from which they and their characteristic differences
are derived, the Pope and Emperor, being relative, must be referred to
some unity wherein may be found the supreme authority without these
characteristic differences. And this will be either God Himself, in
whom every relation is universally united, or in some substance inferior
to God, in whom is found a supreme authority differentiated and de
rived from His perfect supremacy. And so it is evident that the Pope
and Emperor, as men, are to be measured by one standard, but as Pope
and Emperor by another. And this demonstration is from the argument
according to reason.


CHAPTER 16

God alone directs man towards his two-fold goal and
chooses rulers for each; the authority of the Empire
derives from God directly.

Although by the method of reduction to absurdity it has been shown
in the foregoing chapter that the authority of Empire has not its source
in the Chief Pontiff, yet it has not been fully proved, save by an infer
ence, that its immediate source is God, seeing that if the authority does
not depend on the Vicar of God, we conclude that it depends on God
Himself. For a perfect demonstration of the proposition we must prove
directly that the Emperor, or Monarch, of the world has immediate
relationship to the Prince of the universe, who is God.

In order to realize this, it must be understood that man alone of all
beings holds the middle place between corruptibility and incorrupti
bility, and is therefore rightly compared by philosophers to the horizon
which lies between the two hemispheres. Man may be considered with
regard to either of his essential parts, body or soul. If considered in
regard to the body alone, he is perishable; if in regard to the soul alone,
he is imperishable. So the Philosopher spoke well of its incorruptibility
when he said in the second book on the Soul, "And this only can be sepa
rated as a thing eternal from that which perishes."

If man holds a middle place between the perishable and imperish
able, then, inasmuch as every mean shares the nature of the extremes,
man must share both natures. And inasmuch as every nature is or
dained for a certain ultimate end, it follows that there exists for man a
two-fold end, in order that as he alone of all beings partakes of the
perishable and the imperishable, so he alone of all beings should be
ordained for two ultimate ends. One end is for that in him which is

perishable, the other for that which is imperishable.
Ineffable Providence has thus designed two ends to be contemplated

of man: first, the happiness of this life, which consists in the activity of
his natural powers, and is prefigured by the terrestrial Paradise; and
then the blessedness of life everlasting, which consists in the enjoyment
of the countenance of God, to which man's natural powers may not
attain unless aided by divine light, and which may be symbolized by
the celestial Paradise.

To these states of blessedness, just as to diverse conclusions, man must
come by diverse means. To the former we come by the teachings of
philosophy, obeying them by acting in conformity with the moral and
intellectual virtues; to the latter through spiritual teachings which
transcend human reason, and which we obey by acting in conformity
with the theological virtues, Faith, Hope, and Charity. Now the former
end and means are made known to us by human reason, which the
philosophers have wholly explained to us; and the latter by the Holy


Spirit, which has revealed to us supernatural but essential truth through
the Prophets and Sacred Writers, through Jesus Christ, the coeternal
Son of God, and through His disciples. Nevertheless, human passion
would cast all these behind, were not men, like horses astray in their
brutishness, held to the road by bit and rein.

Wherefore a two-fold directive agent was necessary to man, in accord
ance with the twofold end; the Supreme Pontiff to lead the human race
to life eternal by means of revelation, and the Emperor to guide it to
temporal felicity by means of philosophic instruction. And since none
or fewand these with exceeding difficultycould attain this port,
were not the waves of seductive desire calmed, and mankind made free
to rest in the tranquillity of peace, therefore this is the goal which he
whom we call the guardian of the earth and Roman Prince should most
urgently seek; then would it be possible for life on this mortal threshing-
floor to pass in freedom and peace. The order of the world follows the
order inherent in the revolution of the heavens. To attain this order it
is necessary that instruction productive of liberality and peace should
be applied by the guardian of the realm, in due place and time, as dis
pensed by Him who is the ever present Watcher of the whole order of
the heavens. And He alone foreordained this order, that by it in His
providence He might link together all things, each in its own place.

If this is so, and there is none higher than He, only God elects and
only God confirms. Whence we may further conclude that neither
those who are now, nor those who in any way whatsoever have been,
called Electors have the right to be so called; rather should they be
entitled heralds of divine providence. Whence it is that those in whom
is vested the dignity of proclamation suffer dissension among themselves
at times, when, all or part of them being shadowed by the clouds of
passion, they discern not the face of God's dispensation.

It is established, then, that the authority of temporal Monarchy de
scends without mediation from the fountain of universal authority.
And this fountain, one in its purity of source, flows into multifarious
channels out of the abundance of its excellence.

Methinks I have now approached close enough to the goal I had
set myself, for I have taken the kernels of truth from the husks of false
hood, in that question which asked whether the office of Monarchy was
essential to the welfare of the world, and in the next which made inquiry
whether the Roman people rightfully appropriated the Empire, and
in the last which sought whether the authority of the Monarch derived
from God immediately, or from some other. But the truth of this final
question must not be restricted to mean that the Roman Prince shall
not be subject in some degree to the Roman Pontiff, for felicity that is
mortal is ordered in a measure after felicity that is immortal. Wherefore
let Caesar honor Peter as a first-born son should honor his father, so


that, refulgent with the light of paternal grace, he may illumine with
greater radiance the earthly sphere over which he has been set by Him
who alone is Ruler of all things spiritual and temporal.

Principles and Ideals

Machiavellian Idealism

Machiavelli was a more diversified writer than is commonly realized;
besides composing political and historical treatises, he wrote poetry
and authored two bawdy comedies which modern critics recognize as
monuments in Italian theatre. The following selections, presenting his
theoretical and idealistic judgments, include: first, prose and poetic
statements of his highest ideals; second, analyses of the nature of
history, which for Machiavelli primarily entails a cyclical view of
change and an unchanging view of humanity; third, reflections on the
role offortune in human events and the effect men can exercise on their
fortune; and fourth, considerations on the nature of government,
emphasizing the significance of degeneration and reform in political
institutions.

Tercets on ambition.

Luigi, though you marvel at this case
Which has occurred in Siena, you don't seem
To take this world of ours for what it is;

And, if what you have heard seems strange indeed,
As you have written and confirmed to me,
Reflect some more on all our human greed:

For from the Scythian to the Egyptian ground,
From England down to the opposite shore,
One sees this crime in blooming strength is found.

110 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLl'S WORK

What region or what town is free from it?
What village or what hut? Wherever you go,
Ambition follows, too, and Greed with it.

These two came to the world the very day
Man was born; and if they were not down here
Our human state would be most fair and gay.

Hardly had God created stars and light,
Heaven and elements and man (the one
He made lord over all such beauties bright);

And hardly had He thrown out of His home
Proud Angels, out of Eden impious Adam
Who with his mate had dared to taste the pome;

Than ah (it was the time Abel and Cain
Lived with their father from their daily work,
Happy indeed in their poor home's domain),

A hidden power which up above is nurtured,
Among the stars rotating in the sky,
And is not friendly to the human nature,

To give us war and strip us of sweet peace,
To take all happiness and calm away,
Unleashed two furies down to dwell with us.

Naked they are, and each of them goes by
With such a gracefulness that many think
They're grace itself and, oh, full, both, of joy.

On each of them four faces you discern,
And eight hands; and because of this, therefore,
You're caught and seen, if but one of them turn.

With these, Sloth, Hate, and Envy come and stride,
Filling the world with their pestiferous being,
And also Cruelty, Deceit, and Pride.

Concord is hurled by them down to the bottom
And, just to show their infinite desire,
They carry in their hands an urn without bottom.

i*.



MACHIAVELLIAN IDEALISM 111

Because of them life's sweet and quiet days,
Which once filled Adam's dwelling on this earth,
With Charity and Peace speed soon away.

And they were those who with a poisonous pest
Armed Cain against his innocent, meek brother,
Filling with hate his mind and soul and breast.

And it was they who showed their greatest art
Since they were able, in those ancient times,
To make a greedy and ambitious heart,

When men still lived neither with clothes nor with

Fortune, and when they did not know at all
Any example of poverty or wealth.

O human mind, insatiable and vain,
Fraudulent, fickle, and, above all things,
Impious, malignant, full of quick disdain !

It was because of your ambitious wish
The first violent death came to the world,
And the first grass was made to bleed and blush !

With the growth of this seed malevolent
The cause of evil was, then, multiplied,
And reasons for repentance soon were spent.

It comes from this that one descends, one climbs;
And this is why with neither law nor pact
All mortal states must vary at all times.

She prompted the French monarch more than once,
And has destroyed, undone the state of Ludwig,
And that of Saint Mark and of King Alphonso.

And not only the good his foe possesses
Does man desire, but also (it has been
And always will be so, as one can guess)

That which he feigns as good he tries to own
More by removing this or that obstruction
Than by whatever virtue of his own.



112 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLl's WORK

The good in others ever hurts us deep,
And therefore ever with tormenting care
We wish their evil and we lose our sleep.

By natural instinct we are led and trapped
Into all this, and by our mobile passions,
Unless by law or greater strength we're stopped.

But if you really want to know the cause
That makes a people rule, another cry,
While still Ambition reigns in every place;

And why can France remain victorious;
Why, on the other hand, all Italy
Grosses a stormy sea of aches and woes;

And why, in certain lands, appears less strong
And painful the result of that bad seed
Greed and Ambition sow, going along

The answer is that, when Ambition finds
Ferocious hearts and valor armed to fight,
Seldom does fear of harm afflict the mind.

When first a nation lives quite uncontrolled,
By nature, and, by accident, is then
Instructed by good laws and therefore molded

Into order, against external foes
Ambition hurls that fury which, because
Of kings and laws, at home cannot be used:

And nearly always one's own pain, therefore,
Ends; but another's flock is sought and broken
By pent-up fury that must find a war.

Thus, on the other hand, a servile place
Remains exposed to injury and harm
There where Ambition finds but cowardice.

When Cowardice and lack of order are
Ambition's mates, you must expect disgrace
And every ruin, every wound and scar.



MACHIAVELLIAN IDEALISM 113

If you perchance are tempted to accuse
Nature if Italy, so weary and wounded,
Does not produce so hard and bellicose

A people, this, I say, is not sufficient
To erase our cowardice, for education
Can supplement where nature is deficient.

Stern education made Italy bloom
In ancient days, and made her rise and conquer
The entire world and for herself make room.

But now she livesif tears can be called life
Beneath that ruin and unhappy fate
That she has reaped from her long lack of strife.

With all the rest this Cowardice belongs;
And Ambition it was that killed the fair
Italian provinces with wounds and wrongs.

So, forget Siena's fratricidal wounds,
And to this place, Luigi, turn your eyes,
Among these throngs, astounded and marooned.

Here you will see Ambition's double art:
How one steals, how another weeps and sees
All of his fortune snatched and fallen apart.

Let those who want to know what has been done

By others come and look, and let them see if
Ever such horrors were beneath the sun.

One mourns a father; one, a husband; one
Is violently dragged out of his home,
Naked and beaten, bleeding, sad, and dumb.

Alas, how many times, while one embraced
His own dear son for the last time, a sword
Suddenly pierced them bothfrom breast to breast!

His native soil another leaves meanwhile,
Accusing all the cruel, thankless gods,
With his dear ones following him to exile.



114 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLI^ WORK

O tragic things that never were before !
Every day we can see our women, ah,
Give birth out of crushed wombsin horrid gore.

Bemoaning, ah, her daughter, raped, defiled,
A mother says: "For such a wretched wedding,
For such a husband have I reared you, child!"

Ditches are stained with blood, rivers run blood,
And all about lie skulls and legs and hands
And maimed and putrid limbs left there to rot.

Ravenous birds and dogs and savage beasts
Are their paternal burial, alas:
O strange, fierce, horrid tombs in which to rest !

Their faces are forever dark and sad,
For they are just as one who looks about
Awaiting new disasters and new dread.

Wherever, ah, you turn your frightened eyes,
You see the earth one pond of blood and tears,
And the air sounds with shrieks and sobs and sighs.

If you now want to learn Ambition's nature,
And how it should be used, let the distressing
Example of these people be your teacher.

Since man with his sole strength cannot discard her,
He must then use his wisdom to escort
Ambition with ferociousness and order.

At his expense, and futilelyoh, look !
Too late Saint Mark now learns that he should hold
Within his hand a sword, and not a book.

And nonetheless, in general, one's aim
Is to reign; but the more we gain and conquer,
The sooner, then, we losewith greater shame.

Therefore, if something ever should appear
With an importunate, impetuous birth,
Such as to fill all hearts with sudden fear,



machiavellian idealism 115

Do not be frightened, marvel not at all,
For in the world the greatest part of men
Soon into fortune's hands easily fall.

Alas, bemoaning other people's sorrow
With these my words and thoughts, I am oppressed
By a far greater fearthat of the morrow.

I hear and feel Ambition, with that train
Of evils heaven gave her since time's birth,
Flying above each Tuscan mount and plain;

And she has sown so many sparks around
Already among that people full of envy,
That lands and towns will soon be razed to the ground,

If grace or better order do not quench them.

The fallacy of disregarding the common good.

Those serious, though natural enmities, which occur between the
popular classes and the nobility, arising from the desire of the latter to
command, and the disinclination of the former to obey, are the causes
of most of the troubles which take place in cities, and from this diversity
of purpose, all the other evils which disturb republics derive their origin.
This kept Rome disunited; and this, if it be allowable to compare small
things with great, held Florence in disunion; although in each city it
produced a different result; for animosities were only beginning when
the people and nobility of Rome contended, while ours were brought
to a conclusion by the contentions of our citizens. A new law settled
the disputes of Rome, those of Florence were only terminated by the
death and banishment of many of her best people. Those of Rome in
creased her military virtue, while that of Florence was quite extin
guished by her divisions. The quarrels of Rome established different
ranks of society, those of Florence abolished the distinctions which had
previously existed. This diversity of effects must have been occasioned
by the different purposes which the two peoples had in view. While the
people of Rome endeavored to associate with the nobility in the supreme
honors, those of Florence strove to exclude the nobility from all partic
ipation in them: as the desire of the Roman people was more reason
able, no particular offence was given to the nobility; they therefore
consented to it without having recourse to arms; so that, after some
disputes concerning particular points, both parties agreed to the

Source: History of Florence (New York: Colonial Press, 1901), pp. 121-131.



116 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLl'S WORK

enactment of a law which, while it satisfied the people, preserved the
nobility in the enjoyment of their dignity.

On the other hand, the demands of the people of Florence being
insolent and unjust, the nobility, became desperate, prepared for their
defence, with their utmost energy, and thus bloodshed and the exile of
citizens followed. The laws which were afterward made, did not pro
vide for the common good, but were framed wholly in favor of the con
querors. This too must be observed, that from the acquisition of power
made by the people of Rome, their minds were very much improved;
for all the offices of state being attainable as well by the people as the
nobility, the peculiar excellencies of the latter exercised a most beneficial
influence upon the former; and as the city increased in virtue she at
tained a more exalted greatness.

But in Florence, the people being conquerors, the nobility were
deprived of all participation in the government; and, in order to regain
a portion of it, it became necessary for them not only to seem like the
people, but to be like them in behavior, mind, and mode of living.
Hence arose those changes in armorial bearings, and in the titles of
families, which the nobility adopted, in order that they might seem to
be of the people; military virtue and generosity of feeling became
extinguished in them; the people not possessing these qualities, they
could not appreciate them, and Florence became by degrees more and
more depressed and humiliated. The virtue of the Roman nobility
degenerating into pride, the citizens soon found that the business of
the state could not be carried on without a prince. Florence had now
come to such a point, that with a comprehensive mind at the head of
affairs she would easily have been made to take any form that he might
have been disposed to give her; as may be partly observed by a perusal
of the preceding book.

Having given an account of the origin of Florence, the commence
ment of her liberty, with the causes of her divisions, and shown how the
factions of the nobility and the people ceased with the tyranny of the
Duke of Athens, and the ruin of the former, we have now to speak of
the animosities between the citizens and the plebeians, and the various
circumstances which they produced.

The nobility being overcome, and the war with the Archbishop of
Milan concluded, there did not appear any cause of dissension in
Florence. But the evil fortune of the city, and the defective nature of
her laws, gave rise to enmities between the family of the Albizzi and
that of the Ricci, which divided the citizens as completely as those of
the Buondelmonti and the Uberti, or the Donati and the Cerchi had
formerly done. The pontiffs, who at this time resided in France, and
the emperors, who abode in Germany, in order to maintain their in
fluence in Italy, sent among us multitudes of soldiers of many countries,



MACHIAVELLIAN IDEALISM 117

as English, Dutch, and Bretons. As these, upon the conclusion of a war,
were thrown out of pay, though still in the country, they, under the
standard of some soldier of fortune, plundered such people as were
least prepared to defend themselves. In the year 1353 one of these
companies came into Tuscany under the command of Monsignor Reale,
of Provence, and his approach terrified all the cities of Italy. The
Florentines not only provided themselves forces, but many citizens,
among whom were the Albizzi and the Ricci, armed themselves in
their own defence. These families were at the time full of hatred against
each other, and each thought to obtain the sovereignty of the republic
by overcoming his enemy. They had not yet proceeded to open vio
lence, but only contended in the magistracies and councils. The city
being all in arms, a quarrel arose in the old market-place, and, as it
frequently happens in similar cases, a great number of people was
drawn together. The disturbance spreading, it was told the Ricci that
the Albizzi had assailed their partisans, and to the Albizzi that the
Ricci were in quest of them. Upon this the whole city arose, and it was
all the magistrates could do to restrain these families, and prevent the
actual occurrence of a disaster which, without being the fault of either
of them, had been wilfully though falsely reported as having already
taken place. This apparently trifling circumstance served to inflame
the minds of the parties, and make each the more resolved to increase
the number of their followers. And as the citizens, since the ruin of the
nobility, were on such an equality that the magistrates were more
respected now than they had previously been, they designed to proceed
toward the suppression of this disorder with civil authority alone.

We have before related, that after the victory of Charles I the gov
ernment was formed by the Guelfic party, and that it thus acquired
great authority over the Ghibellines. But time, a variety of circum
stances, and new divisions had so contributed to sink this party feeling
into oblivion, that many of Ghibelline descent now filled the highest
offices. Observing this, Uguccione, the head of the family of the Ricci,
contrived that the law against the Ghibellines should be again brought
into operation; many imagining the Albizzi to be of that faction, they
having arisen in Arezzo, and come long ago to Florence. Uguccione
by this means hoped to deprive the Albizzi of participation in the gov
ernment, for all of Ghibelline blood who were found to hold offices,
would be condemned in the penalties which this law provided. The
design of Uguccione was discovered to Piero, son of Filippo degli
Albizzi, and he resolved to favor it; for he saw that to oppose it would
at once declare him a Ghibelline; and thus the law which was renewed
by the ambition of the Ricci for his destruction, instead of robbing Piero
degli Albizzi of reputation, contributed to increase his influence, al
though it laid the foundation of many evils. Nor is it possible for a



118 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLl'S WORK

republic to enact a law more pernicious than one relating to matters
which have long transpired. Piero having favpred this law, which had
been contrived by his enemies for his stumbling-block, it became the
stepping-stone to his greatness; for, making himself the leader of this
new order of things, his authority went on increasing, and he was in
greater favor with the Guelfs than any other man.

As there could not be found a magistrate willing to search out who
were Ghibellines, and as this renewed enactment against them was
therefore of small value, it was provided that authority should be given
to the Capitani to find who were of this faction; and, having discovered,
to signify and admonish them that they were not to take upon them
selves any office of government; to which admonitions, if they were
disobedient, they became condemned in the penalties. Hence, all those
who in Florence are deprived of the power to hold offices are called
"Ammoniti," or "Admonished."

The Capitani in time acquiring greater audacity, admonished not
only those to whom the admonition was applicable, but any others at
the suggestion of their own avarice or ambition; and from 1356, when
this law was made, to 1366, there had been admonished above 200
citizens. The Captains of Parts and the sect of the Guelfs were thus
become powerful; for everyone honored them for fear of being ad
monished; and most particularly the leaders, who were Piero degli Al-
bizzi, Lapo da Castiglionchio, and Carlo Strozzi. This insolent mode
of proceeding was offensive to many; but none felt so particularly
injured with it as the Ricci; for they knew themselves to have occa
sioned it, they saw it involved the ruin of the republic, and their
enemies, the Albizzi, contrary to their intention, become great in
consequence.

On this account Uguccione de' Ricci, being one of the Signory, re
solved to put an end to the evil which he and his friends had originated,
and with a new law provided that to the six Captains of Parts an addi
tional three should be appointed, of whom two should be chosen from
the companies of minor artificers, and that before any party could be
considered Ghibelline, the declaration of the Capitani must be con
firmed by twenty-four Guelfic citizens, appointed for the purpose. This
provision tempered for the time the power of the Capitani, so that the
admonitions were greatly diminished, if not wholly laid aside. Still the
parties of the Albizzi and the Ricci were continually on the alert to
oppose each other's laws, deliberations, and enterprises, not from a
conviction of their inexpediency, but from hatred of their promoters.

In such distractions the time passed from 1366 to 1371, when the
Guelfs again regained the ascendant. There was in the family of the
Buondelmonti a gentleman named Benchi, who, as an acknowledgment
of his merit in a war against the Pisans, though one of the nobility, had

-S..WA



MACHIAVELLIAN IDEALISM 119

been admitted among the people, and thus became eligible to office
among the Signory; but when about to take his seat with them, a law
was made that no nobleman who had become of the popular class
should be allowed to assume that office. This gave great offence to
Benchi, who, in union with Piero degli Albizzi, determined to depress
the less powerful of the popular party with admonitions, and obtain
the government for themselves. By the interest which Benchi possessed
with the ancient nobility, and that of Piero with most of the influential
citizens, the Guelfic party resumed their ascendancy, and by new re
forms among the Parts, so remodelled the administration as to be able
to dispose of the offices of the captains and the twenty-four citizens at
pleasure. They then returned to the admonitions with greater audacity
than ever, and the house of the Albizzi became powerful as the head
of this faction.

On the other hand, the Ricci made the most strenuous exertions
against their designs; so that anxiety universally prevailed, and ruin
was apprehended alike from both parties. In consequence of this, a
great number of citizens, out of love to their country, assembled in the
Church of St. Piero Scarraggio, and after a long consideration of the
existing disorders, presented themselves before the Signors, whom one
of the principal among them addressed in the following terms:

"Many of us, Magnificent Signors! were afraid of meeting even for
consideration of public business, without being publicly called to
gether, lest we should be noted as presumptuous or condemned as
ambitious. But seeing that many citizens daily assemble in the lodges
and halls of the palace, not for any public utility, but only for the grati
fication of their own ambition, we have thought that as those who
assemble for the ruin of the republic are fearless, so still less ought they
to be apprehensive who meet together only for its advantage ; nor ought
we to be anxious respecting the opinion they may form of our assem
bling, since they are so utterly indifferent to the opinion of others. Our
affection for our country, Magnificent Signors! caused us to assemble
first, and now brings us before you, to speak of grievances already great
and daily increasing in our republic, and to offer our assistance for their
removal; and we doubt not that, though a difficult undertaking, it will
still be attended with success, if you will lay aside all private regards,
and authoritatively use the public force.

"The common corruption of all the cities of Italy, Magnificent Si
gnors! has infested and still vitiates your own; for when this province
had shaken off the imperial yoke, her cities not being subject to any
powerful influence that might restrain them, administered affairs, not
as free men do, but as a factious populace; and hence have arisen all
the other evils and disorders that have appeared. In the first place,
there cannot be found among the citizens either unity or friendship,



120 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLI^ WORK

except with those whose common guilt, either against their country or
against private individuals, is a bond of union. And as the knowledge
of religion and the fear of God seem to be alike extinct, oaths and
promises have lost their validity, and are kept as long as it is found
expedient; they are adopted only as a means of deception, and he is
most applauded and respected whose cunning is most efficient and
secure. On this account bad men are received with the approbation
due to virtue, and good ones are regarded only in the light of fools.

"And certainly in the cities of Italy all that is corruptible and corrupt
ing is assembled. The young are idle, the old lascivious, and each sex
and every age abounds with debasing habits, which the good laws, by
misapplication, have lost the power to correct. Hence arise the avarice
so observable among the citizens, and that greediness, not for true
glory, but for unworthy honors; from which follow hatred, animosities,
quarrels, and factions; resulting in deaths, banishments, affliction to all
good men, and the advancement of the most unprincipled ; for the good,
confiding in their innocence, seek neither safety nor advancement by
illegal methods as the wicked do, and thus unhonored and undefended
they sink into oblivion.

"From proceedings such as these, arise at once the attachment for
and influence of parties; bad men follow them through ambition and
avarice, and necessity compels the good to pursue the same course.
And most lamentable is it to observe how the leaders and movers of

parties sanctify their base designs with words that are all piety and
virtue ; they have the name of liberty constantly in their mouths, though
their actions prove them her greatest enemies. The reward which they
desire from victory is not the glory of having give liberty to the city,
but the satisfaction of having vanquished others, and of making them
selves rulers; and to attain their end, there is nothing too unjust, too
cruel, too avaricious for them to attempt. Thus laws and ordinances,
peace, wars, and treaties are adopted and pursued, not for the public
good, nor for the common glory of the state, but for the convenience or
advantage of a few individuals.

"And if other cities abound in these disorders, ours is more than any
infected with them; for her laws, statutes, and civil ordinances are not,
nor have they ever been, established for the benefit of men in a state
of freedom, but according to the wish of the faction that has been upper
most at the time. Hence it follows, that when one party is expelled, or
faction extinguished, another immediately arises; for, in a city that is
governed by parties rather than by laws, as soon as one becomes domi
nant and unopposed, it must of necessity soon divide against itself; for
the private methods at first adopted for its defence, will now no longer
keep it united. The truth of this, both the ancient and modern dis
sensions of our city, prove. Everyone thought that when the Ghibellines



MACHIAVELLIAN IDEALISM 121

were destroyed, the Guelfs would long continue happy and honored;
yet after a short time they divided into Bianchi and Neri, the black
faction and the white. When the Bianchi were overcome, the city was
not long free from factions; for either, in favor of the emigrants, or on
account of the animosity between the nobility and the people, we were
still constantly at war. And as if resolved to give up to others, what in
mutual harmony we either would not or were unable to retain, we con
fided the care of our precious liberty first to King Robert, then to his
brother, next to his son, and at last to the Duke of Athens. Still we
have never in any condition found repose, but seem like men who can
neither agree to live in freedom nor be content with slavery. Nor did
we hesitate (so greatly does the nature of our ordinances dispose us to
division), while yet under allegiance to the king, to substitute for his
majesty, one of the vilest of men born at Agobbio.

"For the credit of the city, the name of the Duke of Athens ought
to be consigned to oblivion. His cruel and tyrannical disposition, how
ever, might have taught us wisdom and instructed us how to live; but
no sooner was he expelled than we handled our arms, and fought with
more hatred, and greater fury than we had ever done on any former
occasion; so that the ancient nobility were vanquished and the city
was left at the disposal of the people. It was generally supposed that
no further occasion of quarrel or of party animosity could arise, since
those whose pride and insupportable ambition had been regarded as
the causes of them were depressed; however, experience proves how
liable human judgment is to error, and what false impressions men
imbibe, even in regard to the things that most intimately concern them;
for we find the pride and ambition of the nobility are not extinct, but
only transferred from them to the people who at this moment, accord
ing to the usual practice of ambitious men, are endeavoring to render
themselves masters of the republic; and knowing they have no chance
of success but what is offered by discord, they have again divided the
city, and the names of Guelf and Ghibelline, which were beginning to
be forgotten (and it would have been well if they had never been heard
among us), are repeated anew in our ears.

"It seems almost necessarily ordained, in order that in human affairs
there may be nothing either settled or permanent, that in all republics
there are what may be called fatal families, born for the ruin of their
country. Of this kind of pest our city has produced a more copious
brood than any other; for not one, but many, have disturbed and
harassed her: first the Buondelmonti and the Uberti; then the Donati
and the Cerchi; and now, oh, ridiculous! oh, disgraceful thought! the
Ricci and the Albizzi have caused a diversion of her citizens.

"We have not dwelt upon our corrupt habits or our old and continual
dissensions to occasion you alarm, but to remind you of their causes;



122 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLI^ WORK

to show that as you, doubtless, are aware of them, we also keep them
in view, and to remind you that their results ought not to make you
diffident of your power to repress the disorders of the present time. The
ancient families possessed so much influence, and were held in such high
esteem, that civil force was insufficient to restrain them; but now, when
the empire has lost its ascendancy, the Pope is no longer formidable,
and the whole of Italy is reduced to a state of the most complete equal
ity, there can be no difficulty. Our republic might, more especially
than any other (although at first our former practices seem to present
a reason to the contrary), not only keep itself united but be improved
by good laws and civil regulations, if you, the Signory, would once re
solve to undertake the matter; and to this, we, induced by no other
motive than the love of our country, would most strongly urge you.
It is true the corruption of the country is great, and much discretion
will be requisite to correct it; but do not impute the past disorders to
the nature of the men, but to the times, which, being changed, give
reasonable ground to hope that, with better government, our city will
be attended with better fortune; for the malignity of the people will be
overcome by restraining the ambition and annulling the ordinances of
those who have encouraged faction, and adopting in their stead only
such principles as are comfortable to true civil liberty. And be assured,
that these desirable ends will be more certainly attained by the benign
influence of the laws, than by a delay which will compel the people to
effect them by force and arms."

The Signory, induced by the necessity of the case, of which they
were previously aware, and further encouraged by the advice of those
who now addressed them, gave authority to fifty-six citizens to provide
for the safety of the republic. It is usually found that most men are
better adapted to pursue a good course already begun, than to discover
one applicable to immediate circumstances. These citizens thought
rather of extinguishing existing factions than of preventing the forma
tion of new ones, and effected neither of these objects. The facilities for
the establishment of new parties were not removed; and out of those
which they guarded against, another more powerful, arose, which
brought the republic into still greater danger. They, however, de
prived three of the family of the Albizzi, and three of that of the Ricci,
of all the offices of government, except those of the Guelfic party, for
three years; and among the deprived were Piero degli Albizzi and
Uguccione de' Ricci. They forbade the citizens to assemble in the
palace, except during the sittings of the Signory. They provided that
if anyone were beaten, or possession of his property detained from him,
he might bring his case before the council and denounce the offender,
even if he were one of the nobility; and that if it were proved, the
accused should be subject to the usual penalties. This provision abated
the boldness of the Ricci, and increased that of the Albizzi; since, al-



machiavellian idealism 123

though it applied equally to both, the Ricci suffered from it by far the
most; for if Piero was excluded from the palace of the Signory, the
chamber of the Guelfs, in which he possessed the greatest authority,
remained open to him; and if he and his followers had previously been
ready to admonish, they became after this injury, doubly so. To this
pre-disposition for evil, new excitements were added.

Love of city.

16 April 1527, Forl
To Francesco Vettori, in Florence
Magnificent, etc.:

Monseigneur de la Motte has been today in the camp of the imperials
with the final form of the agreement made there. If Bourbon accepts,
he must halt his army; if he moves, it is a sign that he does not wish any
agreement. So tomorrow will be the judge of our affairs. Therefore
the decision here, if tomorrow he moves, is to think on war completely,
without having a hair that thinks further of peace; if he does not move,
it is to think of peace and to lay aside all thought of war. With this
north wind we too must sail and, if we decide on war, we must cut off
all the affairs of peace, and in such a way that the allies will come on
without any hesitation, because now we cannot hobble any more but
must go like mad ; often desperation finds remedies that choice has been
unable to find.

They are coming without artillery into a difficult region. Hence if,
with what little life remains to us, we unite with the forces of the League
that are ready, either they will leave this province with shame or they
will come down to reasonable terms.

I love Messer Francesco Guicciardini; I love my native city more
than my soul; and I tell you this through the experience which sixty
years have given me, namely, that I do not believe that ever more
difficult articles than these were struggled with, where peace is neces
sary and war cannot be abandoned; and to have on our hands a prince
who scarcely is able to deal with peace alone or with war alone.

I send you my regards.
Niccol Machiavelli, in Forl.

The greatest good is that which one does to
one's country.

I believe that the greatest honor men can have is that which is will

that can be done, and the most pleasing to God, is that which is done

to one's country. In addition to this, no man is so much raised on high
by any of his acts as are those who have reformed republics and king
doms with new laws and institutions. After those who have been gods,
such men get the first praises; and because there have been few who
have had the opportunity to do it, and still fewer who have known how
to do it, the number of those who have done it is small. This sort of
glory has been so highly esteemed by men, who have never sought any
thing except glory, that those who have not been able to set up a state
in reality have done it in writing; for Aristotle, Plato, and many others
have desired to show the world that if they have not been able to found
a commonwealth as did Solon and Lycurgus, they have not failed from
ignorance but from lack of opportunity to put their ideas into practice.

History
The continuity of human nature.

Prudent men are wont to sayand this not rashly or without good
groundthat he who would foresee what has to be, should reflect on
what has been, for everything that happens in the world at any time
has a genuine resemblance to what happened in ancient times. This is
due to the fact that the agents who bring such things about are men,
and that men have, and always have had, the same passions, whence it
necessarily comes about that the same effects are produced. It is true
that men's deeds are sometimes more virtuous in this country than in
that, and in that than in some other, according to the type of education
from which their inhabitants have derived their mode of life.

Knowledge of the future based on the past is also facilitated when we
find a nation which for a long time has had the same customs, which
has been, for instance, consistently grasping or consistently deceitful, or
which has had any other such vice or virtue. Thus, whoever studies the
past history of this our city of Florence and compares what happened
then with what has happened in quite recent times will find the German
and French peoples imbued with avarice, pride, ferocity and unreli
ability, for all these four characteristics of theirs have at different times
done much harm to our city. In regard to untrustworthiness, for in
stance, everybody knows how often money was given to King Charles
VIII, and how he promised to restore the citadel of Pisa and never did
so; whereby this king displayed alike his untrustworthiness and no
small avarice.

But let us pass over these recent events. Everybody will have heard
of what happened in the war which the Florentines waged against the

Visconti, Dukes of Milan. Since the Florentines had no other expedient
available, they considered bringing the Emperor into Italy that his
standing and his forces might be of avail in the attack on Lombardy.
The Emperor promised to come with a strong army to join them in their
war with the Visconti, and to protect Florence against that power, on
condition that the Florentines gave him a hundred thousand ducats on
his starting out and another hundred thousand when he should arrive in
Italy; to which terms the Florentines agreed. Having been paid the
first instalment, and then the second, when he got to Verona he turned
back without doing anything, pleading that he was held up by those
who had not fulfilled the agreements he had made with them. So that,
had Florence neither been driven to it by necessity nor overcome by
passion, but had read about and become acquainted with the habits of
barbarians in ancient times, she would not have been misled by them on
this occasion and on many others, since they have always been the
same and have behaved everywhere and to everybody in the same way.

This may be seen from what they did of old to the Tuscans. The
latter were much harassed by the Romans by whom they had often
been put to flight and routed. It became clear to them that with their
own forces they could not resist such attacks, so they made an agreement
with the Gauls who had settled on the Italian side of the Alps whereby
in return for a sum of money they were to join forces with them and to
march against the Romans. The result was that, having accepted the
money, the Gauls refused to take up arms on their behalf, alleging that
they had accepted it not on the understanding that they should make
war on the enemies of Tuscany but that they should abstain from pillag
ing Tuscan territory. So that, owing to the avarice and untrustworthi-
ness of the Gauls, the Tuscan peoples at once lost their money and the
help they had hoped to get from them.

Thus we see that in the case of the ancient Tuscans and in that of
the Florentines, the Gauls adopted the same policy; from which it is
easy to judge how much reliance rulers can place in them.

The cycle of human affairs.

It may be observed, that provinces amid the vicissitudes to which they
are subject, pass from order into confusion, and afterward recur to a
state of order again; for the nature of mundane affairs not allowing them
to continue in an even course, when they have arrived at their greatest
perfection, they soon begin to decline. In the same manner, having
been reduced to disorder, and sunk to their utmost state of depression,
unable to descend lower, they, of necessity, reascend; and thus from

good they gradually decline to evil, and from evil again return to good.
The reason is, that valor produces peace; peace, repose; repose, dis
order; disorder, ruin; so from disorder, order springs; from order, virtue,
and from this, glory and good-fortune. Hence, wise men have observed,
that the age of literary excellence is subsequent to that of distinction in
arms; and that in cities and provinces, great warriors are produced be
fore philosophers. Arms having secured victory, and victory peace, the
buoyant vigor of the martial mind cannot be enfeebled by a more ex
cusable indulgence than that of letters; nor can indolence, with any
greater or more dangerous deceit, enter a well-regulated community.

The continuity of world and purpose of studying history.

Men always, but not always with good reason, praise bygone days and
criticise the present, and so partial are they to the past that they not
only admire past ages the knowledge of which has come down to them
in written records, but also, when they grow old, what they remember
having seen in their youth. And, when this view is wrong, as it usually
is, there are, I am convinced, various causes to which the mistake may
be due.

The first of them is, I think, this. This whole truth about olden times
is not grasped, since what redounds to their discredit is often passed
over in silence, whereas what is likely to make them appear glorious is
pompously recounted in all its details. For so obsequious are most
writers to the fortune of conquerors that, in order to make their victor
ies seem glorious, they not only exaggerate their own valorous deeds,
but also magnify the exploits of the enemy, so that anyone born after
wards either in the conquering or in the conquered province may find
cause to marvel at such men and such times, and is bound, in short, to
admire them and to feel affection for them.

Another reason is that, since it is either through fear or through
envy that men come to hate things, in the case of the past the two most
powerful incentives for hating it are lacking, since the past cannot hurt
you nor give you cause for envy. Whereas it is otherwise with events in
which you play a part and which you see with your own eyes, for of
these you have an intimate knowledge, are in touch with every detail,
and in them find, mingled with much good, also that which displeases
you; so that you cannot help thinking them far inferior to the remote
past, even though in fact the present is much more deserving of praise
and renown. I am not here referring to what pertains to the arts, for
in themselves they have so much lustre that time can scarce take away
or add much to the glory which they themselves deserve. I am speaking

HISTORY 127

of things appertaining to human life and human customs, the evidence
for whose merit is not so clear to one's eyes.

My answer is, then, that it is true there exists this habit of praising
the past and criticising the present, and not always true that to do so
is a mistake, for it must be admitted that sometimes such a judgment
is valid because, since human affairs are ever in a state of flux, they
move either upwards or downwards. Thus one sees a city or a province
that has been endowed with a sound political constitution by some emi
nent man, thanks to its founder's virtue for a time go on steadily im
proving. Anyone born in such a state at such a time, is wrong if he
gives more praise to the past than to the present, and his mistake will
be due to the causes we have mentioned above. But those who are born
in this city or province later on, when there has come a time in which
it is on the decline and is deteriorating, will not then be in error.

When I reflect that it is in this way that events pursue their course it
seems to me that the world has always been in the same condition, and
that in it there has been just as much good as there is evil, but that this
evil and this good has varied from province to province. This may be
seen from the knowledge we have of ancient kingdoms, in which the
balance of good and evil has changed from one to the other owing to
changes in their customs, whereas the world as a whole has remained
the same. The only difference is that the world's virtue first found a
home in Assyria, then flourished in Media and later in Persia, and at
length arrived in Italy and Rome. And, if since the Roman empire
there has been no other which has lasted, and in which the world's
virtue has been centred, one none the less finds it distributed amongst
many nations where men lead virtuous lives. There was, for instance,
the kingdom of the Franks; the kingdom of the Turks, [i.e.] that of the
Sultan; and today all the peoples of Germany. Earlier still there were
the Saracens, who performed such great exploits and occupied so much
of the world, since they broke up the Roman empire in the East. Hence,
after ruin had overtaken the Romans, there continued to exist in all
these provinces and in all these separate units, and still exists in some of
them, that virtue which is desired and quite rightly praised. If, then,
anyone born there praises the past over and above the present, he may
well be mistaken; but anyone born in Italy who is not an ultramontane
at heart, or anyone born in Greece who is not at heart a Turk, has good
reason to criticise his own times and to praise others, since in the latter
there are plenty of things to evoke his admiration, whereas in the former
he comes across nothing but extreme misery, infamy and contempt, for
there is no observance either of religion or of the laws, or of military
traditions, but all is besmirched with filth of every kind. And so much
the more are these vices detestable when they are more prevalent
amongst those who sit on the judgment seat, prescribe rules for others,
and expect from them adoration.

But to return to our main point, I maintain that if man's judgment
is biased when he tries to decide which is the better, the present age,
or some past age of which he cannot have so perfect a knowledge as he
has of his own times precisely because it is long since past, this ought
not to bias the judgment of old men when they compare the days of
their youth with those of their old age, for of both they have had the
same knowledge and experience. Nor would it in point of fact, if dur
ing the various phases of their lives men judged always in the same way
and had the same appetites. But, as men's appetites change, even
though their circumstances remain the same, it is impossible that things
should look the same to them seeing that they have other appetites,
other interests, other standpoints, from what they had in their youth.
For, since, when men grow old, they lack energy but increase in judg
ment and prudence, it is inevitable that what in their youth appeared
to be tolerable and good, in their old age should become intolerable
and bad; so that, instead of blaming the times, they should lay the
blame on their own judgment.

Furthermore, human appetites are insatiable, for by nature we are
so constituted that there is nothing we cannot long for, but by fortune
we are such that of these things we can attain but few. The result is
that the human mind is perpetually discontented, and of its possessions
is apt to grow weary. This makes it find fault with the present, praise
the past, and long for the future; though for its doing so no rational
cause can be assigned. Hence I am not sure but that I deserve to be
reckoned amongst those who thus deceive themselves if in these my
discourses I have praised too much the days of the ancient Romans
and have found fault with our own. Indeed, if the virtue which then
prevailed and the vices which are prevalent today were not as clear
as the sun, I should be more reserved in my statements lest I should fall
into the very fault for which I am blaming others. But as the facts are
there for any one to see, I shall make so bold as to declare plainly what
I think of those days and of our own, so that the minds of young men
who read what I have written may turn from the one and prepare to
imitate the other whenever fortune provides them with occasion for so
doing. For it is the duty of a good man to point out to others what is
well done, even though the malignity of the times or of fortune has not
permitted you to do it for yourself, to the end that, of the many who
have the capacity, some one, more beloved of heaven, may be able to
do it.

Having, therefore, in the discourses of the last book spoken of the
decisions the Romans came to in regard to the internal affairs of the
city, in this we shall speak of the measures the Roman people took to
increase their empire.



fortune 129

The end, alas, was near of that cold night
As one by one the stars were fading fast,
And the whole sky was turning, turning white.

The moon was being vanquished by the sun
When thus my lady spoke: "I must now leave,
And do the things that must indeed be done

"To please our fate forever, lest I should
Be shamed: I have to take all my flocks out
Where they can find their long-awaited food.

"But in the meantime you alone shall be
Here in this room, and when tonight I'm back,
All this big place I will take you to see.

"Do not go outand my advice now take:
If people call, answer no one: for many
Were fully ruined by this one mistake."

And so she went; and I, who had now turned
All of my thoughts to her beautiful face
That more than any other shone and burned,

Seeing myself in that room all alone,
Jumped out of bed, so as to quench a bit
The fire that in my heart had quickly grown.

And as soon as I was far from her side,
The wound that she alone had fully healed,
By my old, piercing thoughts was opened wide.

&gt;

I was just like a person who suspects
Many a thing, and but deceives himself
By wanting something he does not expect:

And since one thought follows another thought,
My mind flew back to all the past events
Which, though time passes, we cannot forget.

Thinking now this, now that, in my unrest,
All nations great and famous I recalled,
Which fortune oft had bitten, or caressed;

And they all seemed to me so very high
That I decided, then, to meditate
On how all things change in this world, and why.

The most precipitous ill to ruin states
Is always this: all rulers here on earth
With wealth and power never feel replete.

And of their greed this is the main result:
Those who have lost are not content, and start
To think of ruining those who now exult.

One rises, then, and one must lose his life;
And he who now has risen is devoured

By sudden doubt and thirst for some new strife.

This is the appetite that ruins all
States: and the wonder of all this is that
Men know this trap and yet into it fall.

Saint Mark, importunate and eager to run,
Hoping forever for propitious winds,
Did not think twice to ruin everyone;

Nor did he see how too much power and pomp
Was hurting him, and it would have been better
To keep beneath the water tail and rump.

Often with tears one occupies the throne
And, as soon as he gets it, realizes
It is to his own ruin, his own moan.

Athens and Sparta, whose renown and sound
Spread through the world, into oblivion sank
The day they seized and tamed the states around.

In Germany, as is at present found,
Each city lives secure and safe from harm,
Barely encompassing six miles of ground.



FORTUNE 131

And our own city was not scared at all
By Henry and his whole tremendous might
While her own boundaries ended with her walls;

But now that all her power has greatly spread,
And she has gained in greatness and in ground,
Not only armies, but all things she dreads:

For, as you know, man has sufficient vigor
To lift one body, but his strength can fail
To lift a weight that has become much bigger.

One whose ambition is to reach both poles,
Like Icarus after his foolish flight,
Upon the ground in ruination falls.

True, more or less a state will last as long
As all its laws are quite efficient, and
The order of its life is felt and strong.

That kingdom or that empire will not stop
Which is by constant valor forced to act,
And is forever destined to go up;

But, on the contrary, a city sour
With savage thorns and disorderly bushes
Will soon become, if she will alter power

Between summer and winter, thus deceiving
Herself by aiming always at low goals
When laws are good, yet bad the ways of living.

Who ancient history well understands,
He knows each empire starts with Ninyas
And with Sardanapalus sadly ends.

Just as a god the first one was renowned;
The second among maidens, handling flax,
Just like a maiden was once seen and found.

Valor it is that quiets regions down:
And then from quiet, laziness derives,
And laziness soon burns both land and town.

Then, once a nation has long had its share
Of disorder and war, valor again
Is born and back it goes to dwell right there.

This is the way Order is told to run
By Him who governs us, so that no thing
May ever find a pause beneath the sun.

And it is, and will always be, and was
Always so: evil follows good; good, evil;
And each is of the other the sole cause.

True, there are those who think that greed has been
Fatal to kingdoms, and that these may be
Destroyed by usury or carnal sin;

They believe also that their greatness comes,
And both their height and power thus derive,
From prayers and from fastings and from alms.

But those who are more wise and prudent claim
That all such things can neither ruin states
Nor keep on earth their power and their fame.

To think that without you for you God fights,
While you are on your knees and nothing do,
Has ruined many kingdoms, many states.

Prayers are necessary as a rule,
And he who from his people snatches rites
And orisons is utterly a fool.

Perfect control and union they keep,
And if you have all this, it is quite true
You will good fortune ultimately reap.

But let your brain prove not so small and short
By thinking that, should your house fall and crumble,
God would soon save it with no man's support:

You would soon die beneath its very stones.

FORTUNE 133

Men and fortune.

If one ponders well the course of human affairs, it will be seen that
many events happen and many misfortunes come about, against which
the heavens have not been willing that any provision at all should be
made. Since this statement holds good in the case of Rome, which was
conspicuous alike for virtue, religion, and orderly conduct, it is no
wonder that the same thing happens yet more often in cities and prov
inces which are lacking in these respects. There is a well-known pas
sage in which Titus Livy shows at length and with great force the power
that heaven exercises over human affairs. He says that, with a view
to making the Romans recognise its power, heaven first caused the
Fabii to act wrongly when sent as ambassadors to the Gauls, and by
means of what they did excited the Gauls to make war on Rome ; then
ordained that in Rome nothing worthy of the Roman people should be
done to meet their attack; for first it brought about that Camillus, who
was the only hope they had in those evil days, should be sent as an exile
to Ardea; then that, when the Gauls were marching on Rome, they
did not appoint a dictator, as they had done to meet the attack of the
Volsci and other enemies in the neighbourhood. It also caused them
to be weak and to take no particular care in calling up troops, who were
so slow in taking up arms that they scarce had time to confront the
Gauls on the banks of the Allia, which was but ten miles from Rome.
There the tribunes set up their camp without their accustomed dili
gence, since they did not inspect the site beforehand, nor surround it
with trenches and stockades, nor take any other precautions, either
human or divine; while in preparing for battle they made their ranks
thin and weak, and neither troops nor officers behaved as Roman
discipline required. No blood was shed during the battle because at
the first onslaught the Romans ran away, the greater number going to
Veii, and the rest retiring on Rome, where they sought refuge in the
Capitol without first going home; whereupon the senate took so little
thought for Rome's defence that, for one thing, they omitted to close
the gates; and some of its members fled, while others went with the rest
into the Capitol. Granted, in their defence of the Capitol they used
some sort of discipline, for they did not pack all the useless people in
side, and they got in all the corn they could, so as to be able to stand
the siege; while of the useless crowd of old men, women and children,
most fled to the country round about, and the rest stayed in Rome at
the mercy of the Gauls. So that no one who had read of what was done
so often in years gone by and were to read what was now being done,
would think they were one and the same people.

Having described all the disorders mentioned above, Titus Livy
concludes with the remark: 'To such an extent does fortune blind the.
minds of men when she does not want them to oppose the force she
is using.'

Nor can anything be more true than the conclusion Livy draws.
Hence men who in this life normally either suffer great adversity or
enjoy great prosperity, deserve neither praise nor blame, for one usually
finds that they have been driven either to ruin or to greatness by the
prospect of some great advantage which the heavens have held out,
whereby they have been given the chance, or have been deprived of the
chance, of being able to act virtuously. Fortune arranges this quite
nicely. For, when it wants a man to take the lead in doing great things,
it chooses a man of high spirits and great virtue who will seize the oc
casion it offers him. And in like manner, when it wants a man to bring
about a great disaster, it gives precedence to men who will help to
promote it; and, if anyone gets in the way, it either kills him off or
deprives him of all power of doing good.

It plainly appears from Livy's evidence that, in order to make Rome
greater and to lead it on to its future greatness, fortune decided it was
necessary first to chastise it in a way that will be described at length
in the beginning of the next book, but did not want to ruin it altogether.
Hence we see that it made an exile of Camillus, but did not cause him
to die; that it caused Rome to be taken, but not the Capitol; that it
arranged matters so that nothing useful was thought of to help Rome,
nor anything overlooked that could help in the defence of the Capitol.
It brought it about that, since Rome was to be taken, the greater part
of the troops which were routed at Allia, should go on to Veii, thus
leaving the city without any men to defend it. But in arranging things
thus, it also prepared the way for Rome's recovery; for since there was
a Roman army at Veii, and Camillus was at Ardea, it became possible
to make a more vigorous attempt to deliver the fatherland under a
general whose career was free from the stain of defeat and whose
reputation was untarnished.

In confirmation of this one might adduce further examples from
modern times, but I do not think this necessary, so pass them over,
since that I have given should be enough to satisfy anybody. I assert
once again as a truth to which history as a whole bears witness that
men may second their fortune, but cannot oppose it; that they may act
in accordance with, but cannot infringe, its ordinances. Yet they should
never give up, because there is always hope, though they know not the
end and move towards it along roads which cross one another and as
yet are unexplored; and since there is hope, they should not despair, no
matter what fortune brings or in what travail they find themselves. . . .

Amongst the other splendid things which our historian makes



FORTUNE 135

Camillus say and do in order to show how an outstanding man should
behave he puts into Camillus' mouth these words: 'The dictatorship
did not elate me, nor did exile depress me. One sees here how great
men remain the same whatever befalls. If fortune changes, sometimes
raising them, sometimes casting them down, they do not change, but
remain ever resolute, so resolute in mind and in conduct throughout
life that it is easy for anyone to see that fortune holds no sway over them.
Not so do weak men behave; for by good fortune they are buoyed up
and intoxicated, and ascribe such success as they meet with, to a virtue
they never possessed, so that they become insupportable and odious to
all who have anything to do with them. This then brings about a
sudden change in their lot, the prospect of which causes them to go to
the other extreme and to become base and abject. Hence it comes
about that rulers so built prefer to run away rather than to defend
themselves in adversity, just as do men who find themselves defenceless
because they have misused the good fortune they had.

These virtues and these vices, which are found as I have been saying
in a particular man, are found in a republic; of which the Romans
and the Venetians provide us with examples. No bad luck ever made
the first become abject, nor did good fortune ever make them arrogant.
This is manifest from their behaviour after the defeat at Cannae, and
after the victory they gained over Antiochus. For though the defeat
was very serious since it was their third, they never became disheartened,
but kept their armies in the field; declined to redeem those who had
allowed themselves to be taken prisoners, contrary to their practice,
did not send emissaries to Hannibal or to Carthage to sue for peace,
but, dispensing with any such abject steps as these, devoted their whole
attention to the war, and, owing to shortage of men, armed both the old
and the slaves. When Hanno, the Carthaginian, came to hear of this,
he pointed out to the Carthaginian senateas we have remarked above,
what small account the Romans made of the defeat at Cannae. Hence
it is clear that in trying times the Romans were not despondent, nor
were they humbled. Nor, on the other hand, did prosperous times
make them arrogant; for when Antiochus sent envoys to Scipio to ask
for terms prior to the battle in which he was finally defeated, Scipio
laid down the following as his conditions for peace: that Antiochus
should withdraw into Syria and that the rest should be left to the deci
sion of the Roman people. These terms Antiochus having rejected,
a battle took place, and having lost it, he sent to Scipio envoys com
missioned to accept all the conditions which the victors should lay
down. Whereupon Scipio proposed precisely the same terms as those
he had offered before he won, and then remarked 'that the Romans,
when beaten, do not lose courage, nor, when they win, do they become
arrogant'.

The Venetians we find doing just the opposite of this. To them
it seemed that their good fortune was due to a virtue which they did
not in fact possess. Moreover, so arrogant did they become that they
called the king of France a 'son of St. Mark', showed no respect for
the Church, had their eye by no means on Italy alone, but had already
made up their minds to set up a monarchy similar to that of Rome.
Then, when good luck deserted them and a partial defeat was inflicted
on them at Vaila by the king of France, they lost the whole of their
dominions, not merely through rebellions, but a goodly portion of them
they gave to the Pope and to the king of Spain out of sheer dejection
and despondency of mind. So dispirited, indeed, were they that they
sent ambassadors to the Emperor offering to become his tributaries, and
wrote grovelling and abject letters to the Pope to stir up his compassion.
To reach which unhappy state it took them four days, and yet it was but
a partial defeat they had suffered; for, after the engagement, in the
fighting which took place during the retreat of their army only about
half their forces were engaged, so that one of their commissioners who
escaped, reached Verona with more than twenty thousand troops,
comprising both foot and cavalry. Hence, if in Venice and in Venetian
institutions there had been any sort of virtue they could easily have
pulled themselves together and tried their luck again, this time either
to win or to lose with greater glory, or to come to an agreement on
more honourable terms. But their pusillanimity, which arose from
their institutions being ill adapted for war, made them lose at one
stroke alike their dominions and their courage.

It will always happen thus to any state governed as was theirs. For
this arrogance in prosperity and dejection in adversity is due to the
way you behave and to the education you have received; which, if it
be feeble and futile, makes you the same, and if it be of the other kind,
makes you another sort of person, i.e. makes you know the world
better and so be less exhilarated in good times and less depressed in
bad. And what I say of the individual here may be said also of the
many who live together in one and the same republic, for they are
fashioned to the same state of perfection as characterises that republic's
mode of life.

Although I have said elsewhere that the security of all states is based
on good military discipline, and that where it does not exist, there can
neither be good laws nor anything else that is good, to repeat this does
not seem to me superfluous; for the need for this discipline is apparent
on every page in Livy's history, where one sees that the soldiery cannot
be good unless they are in training, and that it is impossible to train
them unless they are your own subjects. For, since no soldiery is always
at war, nor yet can be, it is important to train it in time of peace; but
this training is impossible on account of the cost except in the case
of subjects.

When Camillus led forth an army to fight the Tuscans, as we have
said above, and his soldiers saw how large was the army of the enemy,
they were terrified, for so inferior did they feel themselves to be that it
looked to them as if they could not possibly withstand their attack.
When it came to the ears of Camillus that the men in camp were so
ill disposed to fight, he appeared amongst them and, going about the
camp talking to this group of soldiers and that, drove this notion out of
their heads. Finally, without issuing any further orders to those in
camp, he merely said: 'Let each man do what he has been taught to do
or has been accustomed to do.' If we consider carefully this restraint
and the words used to encourage the men to go and fight the enemy,
it is clear that neither could such words have been used nor the army
have been induced to do any such thing unless that army had already
been trained and drilled both in peace-time and in war. For on soldiers
who have not learned how to do anything, no general can rely, confident
that anything they may do will be well done. Even should a second
Hannibal command such troops he would in that case go under. For,
since during a battle a general cannot be everywhere, he will inevitably
meet with disaster unless he has already so drilled every unit that it has
imbibed his spirit and is well acquainted with his practice and mode
of procedure.

If then a city be armed and disciplined as Rome was, and all its
citizens, alike in their private and official capacity, have a chance to
put alike their virtue and the power of fortune to the test of experience,
it will be found that always and in all circumstances they will be of the
same mind and will maintain their dignity in the same way. But, when
they are not familiar with arms and trust merely to the whim of fortune,
not to their own virtue, they will change with the changes of fortune
and will display in all cases the characteristics exemplified by the
Venetians.

Government

Kinds, origin, and cycle of government.

I propose to dispense with a discussion of cities which from the outset
have been subject to another power, and shall speak only of those which
have from the outset been far removed from any kind of external
servitude, but, instead, have from the start been governed in accordance
with their wishes, whether as republics or principalities. As such cities
have had diverse origins, so too they have had diverse laws and institu
tions. For either at the outset, or before very long, to some of them laws
have been given by some one person at some one time, as laws were

138 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLl'S WORK

given to the Spartans by Lycurgus; whereas others have acquired them
by chance and at different times as occasion arose. This was the case
in Rome.

Happy indeed should we call that commonwealth which produces a
man so prudent that men can live securely under the laws which he
prescribes without having to emend them. Sparta, for instance, ob
served its laws for more than eight hundred years without corrupting
them and without any dangerous disturbance. Unhappy, on the other
hand, in some degree is that city to be deemed which, not having
chanced to meet with a prudent organiser, has to reorganise itself.
And, of such, that is the more unhappy which is the more remote from
order; and, of these, that is the more remote from order whose insti
tutions have missed altogether the straight road which leads it to its
perfect and true destiny. For it is almost impossible that states of this
type should by any eventuality be set on the right road again; whereas
those which, if their order is not perfect, have made a good beginning
and are capable of improvement, may become perfect should some
thing happen which provides the opportunity. It should, however, be
noted that they will never introduce order without incurring danger,
because few men ever welcome new laws setting up a new order in the
state unless necessity makes it clear to them, that there is need for such
laws; and since such a necessity cannot arise without danger, the state
may easily be ruined before the new order has been brought to com
pletion. The republic of Florence bears this out, for owing to what
happened at Arezzo in '02 it was reconstituted, and owing to what
happened at Prato in '12 its constitution was destroyed.

It being now my intention to discuss what were the institutions of the
city of Rome and what events conducted to its perfection, I would
remark that those who have written about states say that there are to
be found in them one of three forms of government, called by them
Principality, Aristocracy, and Democracy, and that those who set up a
government in any particular state must adopt one of them, as best
suits their purpose.

Othersand with better judgment many thinksay that there are
six types of government, of which three are very bad, and three are
good in themselves but easily become corrupt, so that they too must
be classed as pernicious. Those that are good are the three above men
tioned. Those that are bad are the other three, which depend on them,
and each of them is so like the one associated with it that it easily passes
from one form to the other. For Principality easily becomes Tyranny.
From Aristocracy the transition to Oligarchy is an easy one. Democracy is
without difficulty converted into Anarchy. So that if anyone who is
organising a commonwealth sets up one of the three first forms of gov
ernment, he sets up what will last but for a while, since there are no



GOVERNMENT 139

means whereby to prevent it passing into its contrary, on account of
the likeness which in such a case virtue has to vice.

These variations of government amongst men are due to chance.
For in the beginning of the world, when its inhabitants were few, they
lived for a time scattered like the beasts. Then, with the multiplication
of their offspring, they drew together and, in order the better to be
able to defend themselves, began to look about for a man stronger and
more courageous than the rest, made him their head, and obeyed him.

It was thus that men learned how to distinguish what is honest and
good from what is pernicious and wicked, for the sight of someone
injuring his benefactor evoked in them hatred and sympathy and they
blamed the ungrateful and respected those who showed gratitude, well
aware that the same injuries might have been done to themselves.
Hence to prevent evil of this kind they took to making laws and to
assigning punishments to those who contravened them. The notion of
justice thus came into being.

In this way it came about that, when later on they had to choose a
prince, they did not have recourse to the boldest as formerly, but to one
who excelled in prudence and justice.

But when at a yet later stage they began to make the prince heredi
tary instead of electing him, his heirs soon began to degenerate as com
pared with their ancestors, and, forsaking virtuous deeds, considered
that princes have nought else to do but to surpass other men in extrava
gance, lasciviousness, and every other form of licentiousness. With the
result that the prince came to be hated, and, since he was hated, came
to be afraid, and from fear soon passed to offensive action, which quickly
brought about a tyranny.

From which, before long, was begotten the source of their downfall;
for tyranny gave rise to conspiracies and plots against princes, organised
not by timid and weak men, but by men conspicuous for their liberality,
magnanimity, wealth and ability, for such men could not stand the
dishonourable life the prince was leading. The masses, therefore, at the
instigation of these powerful leaders, took up arms against the prince,
and, when he had been liquidated, submitted to the authority of those
whom they looked upon as their liberators. Hence the latter, to whom
the very term 'sole head' had become odious, formed themselves into a
government. Moreover, in the beginning, mindful of what they had
suffered under a tyranny, they ruled in accordance with the laws which
they had made, subordinated their own convenience to the common
advantage, and, both in private matters and public affairs, governed
and preserved order with the utmost diligence.

But when the administration passed to their descendants who had
no experience of the changeability of fortune, had not been through bad
times, and instead of remaining content with the civic equality then



140 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLl'S WORK

prevailing, reverted to avarice, ambition, and to seizing other men's
womenfolk, they caused government by an aristocracy to become gov
ernment by an oligarchy in which civic rights were entirely disregarded;
so that in a short time there came to pass in their case the same thing
as happened to the tyrant, for the masses, sick of their government,
were ready to help anyone who had any sort of plan for attacking their
rulers; and so there soon arose someone who with the aid of the masses
liquidated them.

Then, since the memory of the prince and of the injuries inflicted
by him was still fresh, and since, having got rid of government by the
few, they had no desire to return to that of a prince, they turned to a
democratic form of government, which they organised in such a way
that no sort of authority was vested either in a few powerful men or in
a prince.

And, since all forms of government are to some extent respected at
the outset, this democratic form of government maintained itself for a
while but not for long, especially when the generation that had organ
ised it had passed away. For anarchy quickly supervened, in which no
respect was shown either for the individual or for the official, and which
was such that, as everyone did what he liked, all sorts of outrages were
constantly committed. The outcome was inevitable. Either at the sug
gestion of some good man or because this anarchy had to be got rid of
somehow, principality was once again restored. And from this there
was, stage by stage, a return to anarchy, by way of the transitions and
for the reasons assigned.

This, then, is the cycle through which all commonwealths pass,
whether they govern themselves or are governed. But rarely do they
return to the same form of government, for there can scarce be a
commonwealth of such vitality that it can undergo often such changes
and yet remain in being. What usually happens is that, while in a
state of commotion in which it lacks both counsel and strength, a
commonwealth becomes subject to a neighbouring and better organised
state. Were it not so, a commonwealth might go on for ever passing
through these governmental transitions.

I maintain then, that all the forms of government mentioned above
are far from satisfactory, the three good ones because their life is so
short, the three bad ones because of their inherent malignity. Hence
prudent legislators, aware of their defects, refrained from adopting as
such any one of these forms, and chose instead one that shared in them
all, since they thought such a government would be stronger and more
stable, for if in one and the same state there was principality, aristocracy
and democracy each would keep watch over the other.

Lycurgus is one of those who have earned no small measure of praise
for constitutions of this kind. For in the laws which he gave to Sparta,



GOVERNMENT 141

he assigned to the kings, to the aristocracy, and to the populace each its
own function, and thus introduced a form of government which lasted
for more than eight hundred years to his very great credit and to the
tranquillity of that city.

It was not so in the case of Solon, who drew up laws for Athens, for
he set up merely a democratic form of government, which was so short
lived that he saw before his death the birth of a tyranny under Pisis-
tratus; and though, forty years later, Pisistratus' heirs were expelled,
and Athens returned to liberty because it again adopted a democratic
form of government in accordance with Solon's laws, it did not retain
its liberty for more than a hundred years. For, in spite of the fact that
many constitutions were made whereby to restrain the arrogance of
the upper class and the licentiousness of the general public, for which
Solon had made no provision, none the less Athens had a very short
life as compared with that of Sparta because with democracy Solon had
not blended either princely power or that of the aristocracy.

But let us come to Rome. In spite of the fact that Rome had no
Lycurgus to give it at the outset such a constitution as would ensure to
it a long life of freedom, yet, owing to friction between the plebs and
the senate, so many things happened that chance effected what had
not been provided by a lawgiver. So that, if Rome did not get fortune's
first gift, it got its second. For her early institutions, though defective,
were not on wrong lines and so might pave the way to perfection. For
Romulus and the rest of the kings made many good laws quite com
patible with freedom; but, because their aim was to found a kingdom,
not a republic, when the city became free, it lacked many institutions
essential to the preservation of liberty, which had to be provided, since
they had not been provided by the kings. So, when it came to pass that
its kings lost their sovereignty, for reasons and in the manner described
earlier in this discourse, those who had expelled them at once appointed
two consuls to take the place of the king, so that what they expelled
was the title of king, not the royal power. In the republic, then, at this
stage there were the consuls and the senate, so that as yet it comprised
but two of the aforesaid estates, namely, Principality and Aristocracy.
It remained to find a place for Democracy. This came about when the
Roman nobility became so overbearing for reasons which will be given
laterthat the populace rose against them, and they were constrained
by the fear that they might lose all, to grant the populace a share in the
government; the senate and the consuls retaining, however, sufficient
authority for them to be able to maintain their position in the common
wealth.

It was in this way that tribunes of the plebs came to be appointed,
and their appointment did much to stabilise the form of government
in this commonwealth, for in its government all three estates now had a



142 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLl's WORK

share. And so favoured was it by fortune that, though the transition
from Monarchy to Aristocracy and thence to Democracy, took place by
the very stages and for the very reasons laid down earlier in this dis
course, none the less the granting of authority to the aristocracy did not
abolish altogether the royal estate, nor was the authority of the aristoc
racy wholly removed when the populace was granted a share in it.
On the contrary, the blending of these estates made a perfect common
wealth; and since it was friction between the plebs and the senate that
brought this perfection about, in the next two chapters we shall show
more fully how this came to be. . . .

People versus prince.

Nothing is more futile and more inconstant than are the masses. So
says our author, Titus Livy, and so say all other historians. For in the
records of the actions men have performed one often finds the masses
condemning someone to death, and then lamenting him and ardently
wishing he were alive. The Roman people did this in Manlius Capi-
tolinus's case: first they condemned him to death, then urgently wished
him back. Of this our author says that 'soon after he had ceased to be
a danger, the desire for him took hold of the people'. And again, when
describing the events which happened in Syracuse after the death of
Hieronymus, the nephew of Hiero, he says: 'It is of the nature of the
masses either servilely to obey or arrogantly to domineer.'

I know not whether the view I am about to adopt will prove so hard
to uphold and so full of difficulties that I shall have either shamefully to
abandon it or laboriously to maintain it; for I propose to defend a posi
tion which all writers attack, as I have said. But, however that may be,
I think, and always shall think there can be no harm in defending an
opinion by arguments so long as one has no intention of appealing
either to authority or force.

I claim, then, that for the failing for which writers blame the masses,
any body of men one cares to select may be blamed, and especially
princes; for anyone who does not regulate his conduct by laws will make
the same mistakes as the masses are guilty of. This is easily seen, for
there are and have been any number of princes, but of good and wise
ones there have been but few. I am speaking of princes who have
succeeded in breaking the bonds which might have held them in check;
amongst which I do not include those kings who were born in Egypt
when that most ancient of ancient realms was governed in accordance
with the law, nor those born in Sparta, nor those born in France in our

GOVERNMENT 143

own times, for the kingdom of France is better regulated by laws than
is any other of which at present we have knowledge. Kings who are
born under such conditions are not to be classed amongst those whose
nature we have to consider in each individual case to see whether it
resembles that of the masses; for, should there be masses regulated by
laws in the same way as they are, there will be found in them the same
goodness as we find in kings, and it will be seen that they neither 'ar
rogantly dominate nor servilely obey'. Such was the Roman populace
which, so long as the republic remained uncorrupt, was never servilely
obsequious, nor yet did it ever dominate with arrogance: on the con
trary, it had its own institutions and magistrates and honourably kept
its own place. But when it was necessary to take action against some
powerful person, it did so, as is seen in the case of Manlius, of the Ten,
and in the case of others who sought to oppress it. Also, when it had to
obey dictators or consuls in the public interest, it did so. Nor is it any
wonder that the Roman populace wanted Manlius Capitolinus back
when he was dead, for what they wanted was his virtues, which had
been such that his memory evoked everyone's sympathy, and would
have had power to produce the same effect in a prince, for all writers
are of opinion that virtue is praised and admired even in one's enemies.
Again, had Manlius, in response to this desire, been raised from the
dead, the Roman populace would have passed on him the same sen
tence as it did, have had him arrested and, shortly after, have con
demned him to death: though, for that matter, one also finds that
reputedly wise princes have put people to death and then wished
them alive again; Alexander, for instance, in the case of Cleitus and
other of his friends, and Herod in the case of Mariamne. But the truth
is that what our historian says of the nature of the masses is not said of
the masses when disciplined by laws, as were the Romans, but of un
disciplined masses, like those of Syracuse, i.e. of masses which make
the same kind of mistakes as do men when infuriated and undisciplined,
just as did Alexander the Great and Herod in the cases cited.

The nature of the masses, then, is no more reprehensible than is the
nature of princes, for all do wrong and to the same extent when there is
nothing to prevent them doing wrong. Of this there are plenty of
examples besides those given, both amongst the Roman emperors and
amongst other tyrants and princes; and in them we find a degree of
inconstancy and changeability in behaviour such as is never found in
the masses.

I arrive, then, at a conclusion contrary to the common opinion which
asserts that populaces, when in power, are variable, fickle and ungrate
ful, and affirm that in them these faults are in no wise different from
those to be found in certain princes. Were the accusation made against
both the masses and princes, it would be true; but, if princes be



144 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLl's WORK
*

excepted, it is false. For when the populace is in power and is well-
ordered, it will be stable, prudent, and grateful, in much the same way,
or in a better way, than is a prince, however wise he be thought. And,
on the other hand, a prince who contemns the laws, will be more un
grateful, fickle, and imprudent than is the populace. Nor is inconstancy
of behaviour due to a difference in nature, for they are pretty much the
same, or, if one be better than the other, it is the populace: it is due
to the greater or less respect which they have for the laws under which
both alike are living.

If we consider the Roman populace it will be found that for four
hundred years they were enemies to the very name of king and lovers
of glory and of the common good of their country. Of both character
istics the Roman populace affords numerous and striking examples.
And, should anyone bring up against me the ingratitude the populace
displayed toward Scipio, my answer is that I have already discussed
this question at length and have there shown the ingratitude of the
populace to be less than that of princes. While in the matter of prudence
and stability I claim that the populace is more prudent, more stable,
and of sounder judgment than the prince. Not without good reason is
the voice of the populace likened to that of God; for public opinion is
remarkably accurate in its prognostications, so much so that it seems
as if the populace by some hidden power discerned the evil and the
good that was to befall it. With regard to its judgment, when two speak
ers of equal skill are heard advocating different alternatives, very rarely
does one find the populace failing to adopt the better view or incapable
of appreciating the truth of what it hears. While, if in bold actions and
such as appear advantageous it errs, as I have said above, so does a
prince often err where his passions are involved, and these are much
stronger than those of the populace.

It is found, too, that in the election of magistrates the populace makes
a far better choice than does the prince; nor can the populace ever be
persuaded that it is good to appoint to such an office a man of infamous
life or corrupt habits, whereas a prince may easily and in a vast variety
of ways be persuaded to do this. Again, one finds that when the popu
lace begins to have a horror of something it remains of the same mind
for many centuries; a thing that is never observed in the case of a prince.
For both these characteristics I shall content myself with the evidence
afforded by the Roman populace, which in the course of so many
hundreds of years and so many elections of consuls and tribunes did
not make four elections of which it had to repent. So much, too, as I
have said, was the title of king hated that no service rendered by one of
its citizens who ambitioned it, could render him immune from the
penalties prescribed. Besides this, one finds that cities in which the
populace is the prince, in a very short time extend vastly their domin-



UPPf- 

GOVERNMENT 145

ions much more than do those which have always been under a prince ;
as Rome did after the expulsion of the kings, and Athens after it was
free of Pisistratus.

This can only be due to one thing: government by the populace is
better than government by princes. Nor do I care whether to this opin
ion of mine all that our historian has said in the aforesaid passage or
what others have said, be objected; because if account be taken of all
the disorders due to populaces and of all those due to princes, and of all
the glories won by populaces and all those won by princes, it will be
found that alike in goodness and in glory the populace is far superior.
And if princes are superior to populaces in drawing up laws, codes of
civic life, statutes and new institutions, the populace is so superior in
sustaining what has been instituted, that it indubitably adds to the
glory of those who have instituted them.

In short, to bring this topic to a conclusion, I say that, just as princely
forms of government have endured for quite a long time, so, too, have
republican forms of government; and that in both cases it has been
essential for them to be regulated by laws. For a prince who does what
he likes is a lunatic, and a populace which does what it likes is unwise.
If, therefore, it be a question of a prince subservient to the laws and of a
populace chained up by laws, more virtue will be found in the populace
than in the prince; and if it be a question of either of them loosed from
control by the law, there will be found fewer errors in the populace than
in the prince, and these of less moment and much easier to put right.
For a licentious and turbulent populace, when a good man can obtain
a hearing, can easily be brought to behave itself; but there is no one to
talk to a bad prince, nor is there any remedy except the sword. From
which an important inference may be drawn in regard to their respec
tive maladies; for, if to cure the malady of the populace a word suffices
and the sword is needed to cure that of a prince, no one will fail to see
that the greater the cure, the greater the fault.

When the populace has thrown off all restraint, it is not the mad
things it does that are terrifying, nor is it of present evils that one is
afraid, but of what may come of them, for amidst such confusion there
may come to be a tyrant. In the case of bad princes it is just the oppo
site: it is present evils that are terrifying, but for the future there is hope,
since men are convinced that the evil ways of a bad prince may make for
freedom in the end. Thus one sees the difference between the two cases
amounts to the same thing as the difference between what is and what
must come to be. The brutalities of the masses are directed against
those whom they suspect of conspiring against the common good; the
brutalities of a prince against those whom he suspects of conspiring
against his own good. The reason why people are prejudiced against
the populace is because of the populace anyone may speak ill without



146 selections from machiavelli^ work

fear and openly, even when the populace is ruling. But of princes
people speak with the utmost trepidation and the utmost reserve.

Nor does it seem to me foreign to my purpose, since I find the topic
attractive, to discuss in the next chapter on which more reliance can
be placed, on confederations made by a republic or on confederations
formed by a prince.

Reform in government: government and religion are
naturally degenerate.

It is a well-established fact that the life of all mundane things is of
finite duration. But things which complete the whole of the course
appointed them by heaven are in general those whose bodies do not
disintegrate, but maintain themselves in orderly fashion either without
change; or, if there be change, it tends rather to their conservation
than to their destruction. Here I am concerned with composite bodies,
such as are states and religious institutions, and in their regard I affirm
that those changes make for their conservation which lead them back to
their start. Hence those are better constituted and have a longer life
whose institutions make frequent renovations possible, or which can be
brought to such a renovation by some event which has nothing to do
with their constitution. For it is clearer than daylight that, without
renovation, these bodies do not last.

The way to renovate them, as has been said, is to reduce them to their
starting-points. For at the start religious institutions, republics and
kingdoms have in all cases some good in them, to which their early
reputation and progress is due. But since in process of time this good
ness is corrupted, such a body must of necessity die unless something
happens which brings it up to the mark. Thus, our medical men, speak
ing of the human body, say that 'every day it absorbs something which
from time to time requires treatment'.

This return to its starting point in the case of a republic, is brought
about either by some external event or by its own intrinsic good sense.
Thus, as an example of the former, we see how it was necessary that
Rome should be taken by the Gauls in order that it should be re-born
and in its re-birth take on alike a new vitality and a new virtue, and
also take up again the observance of religion and justice, both of which
had begun to show blemishes. This plainly appears from Livy's ac
count where he shows how, when the Romans led out their army against
the Gauls and created tribunes with consular power, they observed no
religious ceremony. And, in like manner, not only did they not punish
the three Fabii who had attacked the Gauls 'in contravention of the

GOVERNMENT 147

Law of Nations', but they made them tribunes. Whence it is easy to
infer that of the good constitutions established by Romulus and by those
other wise princes they had begun to take less account than was reason
able and necessary for the maintenance of a free state. This defeat in a
war with outsiders, therefore, came about so that the institutions of this
city should be renovated and to show this people that not only is it
essential to uphold religion and justice, but also to hold in high esteem
good citizens and to look upon their virtue as of greater value than
those comforts of which there appeared to them to be a lack owing to
what these men had done. This actually came about. For as soon as
Rome had been recovered they renewed all the ordinances of their
ancient religion and punished the Fabii who had fought 'in contraven
tion of the Law of Nations'. They also set such esteem on the virtue
and goodness of Camillus that the senate and the rest, putting envy
aside, laid on his shoulders the whole burden of this republic.

It is, therefore, as I have said, essential that men who live together
under any constitution should frequently have their attention called to
it either by some external or by some internal occurrence. When
internal, such occurrences are usually due to some law which from time
to time causes the members of this body to review their position;
or again to some good man who arises in their midst and by his
example and his virtuous deeds produces the same effect as does the
constitution.

Such benefits, therefore, are conferred on a republic either by the
virtue of some individual or by the virtue of an institution. In regard
to the latter, the institutions which caused the Roman republic to return
to its start were the introduction of plebeian tribunes, of the censorship,

4

and of all the other laws which put a check on human ambition and
arrogance; to which institutions life must needs be given by some vir
tuous citizen who co-operates strenuously in giving them effect despite
the power of those who contravene them. Notable amongst such drastic
actions, before the taking of Rome by the Gauls, were the death of
Brutus's sons, the death of the ten citizens, and that of Maelius, the
corn-dealer. After the taking of Rome there was the death of Manlius
Capitolinus, the death of Manlius Torquatus's son, the action taken by
Papirius Cursor against Fabius, his master of horse, and the charge
brought against the Scipios. Such events, because of their unwonted
severity and their notoriety, brought men back to the mark every time
one of them happened; and when they began to occur less frequently,
they also began to provide occasion for men to practise corruption, and
were attended with more danger and more commotion. For between
one case of disciplinary action of this type and the next there ought to
elapse at most ten years, because by this time men begin to change their
habits and to break the laws; and, unless something happens which



148 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLI^ WORK

recalls to their minds the penalty involved and reawakens fear in them,
there will soon be so many delinquents that it will be impossible to
punish them without danger.

In regard to this, those who governed the state of Florence from 1434
to 1494 used to say that it was necessary to reconstitute the government
every five years; otherwise it was difficult to maintain it; where by
'reconstituting the government' they meant instilling men with that
terror and that fear with which they had instilled them when instituting
it in that at this time they had chastised those who, viewed from the
standpoint of this regime, had misbehaved. As, however, the remem
brance of this chastisement disappears, men are emboldened to try
something fresh and to talk sedition. Hence provision has of necessity
to be made against this by restoring that government to what it was
at the start.

Such a return to their starting-point in republics is sometimes due
to the simple virtue of one man alone, independently of any laws spur
ring you to action. For of such effect is a good reputation and good
example that men seek to imitate it, and the bad are ashamed to lead
lives which go contrary to it. Those who in Rome are outstanding ex
amples of this good influence, are Horatius Codes, Scaevola, Fabricius,
the two Decii, Regulus Attilius, and several others, whose rare and
virtuous examples wrought the same effects in Rome as laws and insti
tutions would have done. If then effective action of the kind described

above, together with this setting of good example, had occurred in
that city at least every ten years, it necessarily follows that it would
never have become corrupt. But when both the one and the other
began to occur more rarely, corruption began to spread. For, after
the time of Marcus Regulus, there appeared no examples of this kind,
and, though in Rome there arose the two Catos, between them and
any prior instance there was so great an interval, and again between
the Catos themselves, that they stood alone and their good example
could have no good effect; especially in the case of the younger Cato
who found the greater part of the city so corrupt that he could not by
his example effect any improvement amongst the citizens. So much
then for republics.

As to religious institutions one sees here again how necessary these
renovations are from the example of our own religion, which, if it had
not been restored to its starting-point by St. Francis and St. Dominic,
would have become quite extinct. For these men by their poverty and
by their exemplification of the life of Christ revived religion in the
minds of men in whom it was already dead, and so powerful were these
new religious orders that they prevented the depravity of prelates and
of religious heads from bringing ruin on religion. They also lived so
frugally and had such prestige with the populace as confessors and



mw'; ' "
e

GOVERNMENT 149

preachers that they convinced them it is an evil thing to talk evilly of
evil doing, and a good thing to live under obedience to such prelates,
and that, if they did wrong, it must be left to God to chastise them.
And, this being so, the latter behave as badly as they can, because they
are not afraid of punishments which they do not see and in which they
do not believe. It is, then, this revival which has maintained and
continues to maintain this religion.

Kingdoms also need to be renovated and to have their laws brought
back to their starting-points. The salutary effect this produces is seen
in the kingdom of France, for the conduct of affairs in this kingdom is
controlled by more laws and more institutions than it is in any other.
These laws and these institutions are maintained by parlements, notably
by that of Paris, and by it they are renovated whenever it takes action
against a prince of this realm or in its judgments condemns the king.
Up to now it has maintained its position by the pertinacity with which
it has withstood the nobility of this realm. But should it at any time
let an offence remain unpunished and should offences begin to multiply,
the result would unquestionably be either that they would have to be
corrected to the accompaniment of grievous disorders or that the king
dom would disintegrate.

The conclusion we reach, then, is that there is nothing more neces
sary to a community, whether it be a religious establishment, a king
dom, or a republic, than to restore to it the prestige it had at the outset,
and to take care that either good institutions or good men shall bring
this about rather than that external force should give rise to it. For
though this on occasion may be the best remedy, as it was in Rome's
case, it is so dangerous that in no case is it what one should desire.

In order to make it clear to all how much the action of particular
men contributed to the greatness of Rome and produced in that city
so many beneficial results, I shall proceed to narrate and to discuss
their doings, and shall confine myself to this topic in this third and last
book on this first Decad [of Livy's history]. And, though the actions of
the kings were great and noteworthy, since history deals with them at
length I shall not mention them here, except where they may have done
things with a view to their personal advantage. . . .

Reform in government: liberty and license in cities.

Republican governments, more especially those imperfectly organized,
frequently change their rulers and the form of their institutions; not
by the influence of liberty or subjection, as many suppose, but by that
of slavery and license; for with the nobility or the people, the ministers
respectively of slavery or licentiousness, only the name of liberty is in

150 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLI^ WORK

any estimation, neither of them choosing to be subject either to magis- 
trates or laws. When, however, a good, wise, and powerful citizen
appears (which is but seldom), who establishes ordinances capable of
appeasing or restraining these contending dispositions, so as to prevent
them from doing mischief, then the government may be called free,
and its institutions firm and secure; for having good laws for its basis,
and good regulations for carrying them into effect, it needs not, like
others, the virtue, of one man for its maintenance. With such excellent
laws and institutions, many of those ancient republics, which were of
long duration, were endowed. But these advantages are, and always
have been, denied to those which frequently change from tyranny to
license, or the reverse; because, from the powerful enemies which each
condition creates itself, they neither have, nor can possess, any stability;
for tyranny cannot please the good, and license is offensive to the wise:
the former may easily be productive of mischief, while the latter can
scarcely be beneficial; in the former, the insolent have too much
authority, and in the latter, the foolish; so that each requires for their
welfare the virtue and the good fortune of some individual who may be
removed by death, or become unserviceable by misfortune.

Hence, it appears, that the government which commenced in
Florence at the death of Giorgio Scali, in 1381, was first sustained by
the talents of Maso degli Albizzi, and then by those of Niccolo da
Uzzano. The city remained tranquil from 1414 to 1422; for King
Ladislaus was dead, and Lombardy divided into several parts; so that
there was nothing either internal or external to occasion uneasiness.
Next to Niccolo da Uzzano in authority, were Bartolomeo Valori,
Neroni di Nigi, Rinaldo degli Albizzi, Neri di Gino, and Lapo Nic-
colini. The factions that arose from the quarrels of the Albizzi and the
Ricci, and which were afterwards so unhappily revived by Salvestro
de' Medici, were never extinguished; for though the party most favored
by the rabble only continued three years, and in 1381 was put down,
still, as it comprehended the greatest numerical proportion, it was
never entirely extinct, though the frequent Balias and persecutions of
its leaders from 1381 to 1400, reduced it almost to nothing. The first
families that suffered in this way were the Alberti, the Ricci, and the
Medici, which were frequently deprived both of men and money; and
if any of them remained in the city, they were deprived of the honors
of government. These oft-repeated acts of oppression humiliated the
faction, and almost annihilated it. Still, many retained the remem
brance of the injuries they had received, and a desire of vengeance re
mained pent in their bosoms, ungratified and unquenched. Those
nobles of the people, or new nobility, who peaceably governed the
city, committed two errors, which eventually caused the ruin of their
party; the first was, that by long continuance in power they became



w '

GOVERNMENT 151

insolent; the second, that the envy they entertained toward each other,
and their uninterrupted possession of power, destroyed that vigilance
over those who might injure them, which they ought to have exercised.
Thus daily renewing the hatred of the mass of the people by their
sinister proceedings, and either negligent of the threatened dangers,
because rendered fearless by prosperity, or encouraging them through
mutual envy, they gave an opportunity to the family of the Medici to
recover their influence.

The first to do so was Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici, who having be
come one of the richest men, and being of a humane and benevolent
disposition, obtained the supreme magistracy by consent of those in
power. This circumstance gave so much gratification to the mass of
the people (the multitude thinking they had now found a defender),
that not without occasion the judicious of the party observed it with
jealousy, for they perceived all the former feelings of the city revived.
Niccolo da Uzzano did not fail to acquaint the other citizens with the
matter, explaining to them how dangerous it was to aggrandize one
who possessed so much influence; that it was easy to remedy an evil at
its commencement, but exceedingly difficult after having allowed it to
gather strength; and that Giovanni possessed several qualities far sur
passing those of Salvestro. The associates of Niccolo were uninfluenced
by his remarks; for they were jealous of his reputation, and desired to
exalt some person, by means of whom he might be humbled.

This was the state of Florence, in which opposing feelings began to
be observable, when Filippo Visconti, second son of Giovanni Galeazzo,
having, by the death of his brother, become master of all Lombardy,
and thinking he might undertake almost anything, greatly desired
to recover Genoa, which enjoyed freedom under the Dogiate of Tom
maso da Campo Fregoso. He did not think it advisable to attempt this,
or any other enterprise, till he had renewed amicable relations with the
Florentines, and made his good understanding with them known; but
with the aid of their reputation he trusted he should attain his wishes.
He therefore sent ambassadors to Florence to signify his desires. Many
citizens were opposed to his design, but did not wish to interrupt the
peace with Milan, which had now continued for many years. They
were fully aware of the advantages he would derive from a war with
Genoa, and the little use it would be to Florence. Many others were
inclined to accede to it, but would set a limit to his proceedings, which
if he were to exceed, all would perceive his base design, and thus they
might, when the treaty was broken, more justifiably make war against
him. The question having been strongly debated, an amicable ar
rangement was at length effected, by which Filippo engaged not to
interfere with anything on the Florentine side of the rivers Magra and
Panaro.



152 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLl's WORK

Soon after the treaty was concluded, the duke took possession of
Brescia, and shortly afterward of Genoa, contrary to the expectation
of those who had advocated peace; for they thought Brescia would be
defended by the Venetians, and Genoa would be able to defend her
self. And as in the treaty which Filippo made with the Doge of Genoa,
he had acquired Serezana and other places situated on this side the
Magra, upon condition that, if he wished to alienate them, they should
be given to the Genoese, it was quite palpable that he had broken the
treaty; and he had beside, entered into another treaty with the legate
of Bologna, in opposition to his engagement respecting the Panaro.
These things disturbed the minds of the citizens, and made them,
apprehensive of new troubles, consider the means to be adopted for
their defence.

The dissatisfaction of the Florentines coming to the knowledge of
Filippo, he, either to justify himself, or to become acquainted with
their prevailing feelings, or to lull them to repose, sent ambassadors to
the city, to intimate that he was greatly surprised at the suspicions they
entertained, and offer to revoke whatever he had done that could be
thought a ground of jealousy. This embassy produced no other effect
than that of dividing the citizens; one party, that in greatest reputation,
judged it best to arm, and prepare to frustrate the enemy's designs;
and if he were to remain quiet, it would not be necessary to go to war
with him, but an endeavor might be made to preserve peace. Many
others, either envious of those in power, or fearing a rupture with the
duke, considered it unadvisable so lightly to entertain suspicions of an
ally, and thought his proceedings need not have excited so much dis
trust; that appointing the Ten and hiring forces was in itself a manifest
declaration of war, which, if undertaken against so great a prince,
would bring certain ruin upon the city without the hope of any advan
tage; for possession could never be retained of the conquests that might

&gt;

be made, because Romagna lay between, and the vicinity of the Church
ought to prevent any attempt against Romagna itself. However, the
views of those who were in favor of war prevailed, the Council of Ten
were appointed, forces were hired, and new taxes levied, which, as they
were more burdensome upon the lower than the upper ranks, filled the
city with complaints, and all condemned the ambition and avarice of
the great, declaring that, to gratify themselves and oppress the people,
they would go to war without any justifiable motive.

They had not yet come to an open rupture with the duke, but every
thing tended to excite suspicion; for Filippo had, at the request of the
legate of Bologna (who was in fear of Antonio Bentivogli, an exile of
Bologna at Castel Bolognese), sent forces to that city, which, being close
upon the Florentine territory, filled the citizens with apprehension; but
what gave every one greater alarm, and offered sufficient occasion for



GOVERNMENT 153

the declaration of war, was the expedition made by the duke against
Furli. Giorgio Ordelaffi was Lord of Furli, who dying, left Tibaldo,
his son, under the guardianship of Filippo. The boy's mother, suspi
cious of his guardian, sent him to Ludovico Alidossi, her father, who
was Lord of Imola, but she was compelled by the people of Furli to
obey the will of her deceased husband, to withdraw him from his
natural guardian, and place him in the hands of the duke. Upon this
Filippo, the better to conceal his purpose, caused the Marquis of
Ferrara to send Guido Torello as his agent, with forces, to seize the
government of Furli, and thus the territory fell into the duke's hands.
When this was known at Florence, together with the arrival of forces
at Bologna, the arguments in favor of war were greatly strengthened,
but there were still many opposed to it, and among the rest Giovanni de'
Medici, who publicly endeavored to show, that even if the ill designs
of the duke were perfectly manifest, it would still be better to wait and
let him commence the attack, than to assail him; for in the former case
they would be justified in the view of the princes of Italy as well as in
their own; but if they were to strike the first blow at the duke, public
opinion would be as favorable to him as to themselves; and besides,
they could not so confidently demand assistance as assailants, as they
might do if assailed; and that men always defend themselves more
vigorously when they attack others. The advocates of war considered
it improper to await the enemy in their houses, and better to go and
seek him; that fortune is always more favorable to assailants than to
such as merely act on the defensive, and that it is less injurious, even
when attended with greater immediate expense, to make war at an
other's door than at our own. These views prevailed, and it was
resolved that the Ten should provide all the means in their power for
rescuing Furli from the hands of the duke.

Filippo, finding the Florentines resolved to occupy the places he had
undertaken to defend, postponed all personal considerations against
Imola, that Ludovico, having to provide for the defence of his own pos
sessions, might be unable to protect the interests of his grandson.
Agnolo approached Imola while the forces of the Florentines were at
Modigliana, and an intense frost having rendered the ditches of the
city passable, he crossed them during the night, captured the place,
and sent Ludovico a prisoner to Milan. The Florentines finding Imola
in the hands of the enemy, and the war publicly known, sent their
forces to Furli and besieged it on all sides. That the duke's people
might not relieve it, they hired Count Alberigo, who from Zangonara,
his own domain, overran the country daily, up to the gates of Imola.
Agnolo della Pergola, finding the strong position which the Florentines
had taken prevented him from relieving Furli, determined to attempt
the capture of Zangonara, thinking they would not allow that place



154 selections from machiavelli^ work

to be lost, and that in the endeavor to relieve it they would be com
pelled to give up their design against Furli, and come to an engage
ment under great disadvantage. Thus the duke's people compelled
Alberigo to sue for terms, which he obtained on condition of giving up
Zangonara, if the Florentines did not relieve him within fifteen days.
This misfortune being known in the Florentine camp and in the city,
and all being anxious that the enemy should not obtain the expected
advantage, they enabled him to secure a greater; for having abandoned
the siege of Furli to go to the relief of Zangonara, on encountering the
enemy they were soon routed, not so much by the bravery of their
adversaries as by the severity of the season; for, having marched many
hours through deep mud and heavy rain, they found the enemy quite
fresh, and were therefore easily vanquished. Nevertheless, in this great
defeat, famous throughout all Italy, no death occurred except those of
Ludovico degli Obizzi and two of his people, who having fallen from
their horses were drowned in the morass.

Reform in government: difficult reform demands a prince.

It will not, I think, be foreign to my purpose nor contrary to the plan
of my previous discourse to consider whether in a corrupt state it is
possible to maintain a free government where it exists, and whether,
when there has been none, it can be set up. In regard to this question
I maintain that in either case it will be a very difficult thing to do. It
is, moreover, almost impossible to lay down rules, for the method to be
adopted will of necessity depend upon the degree of corruption. None
the less, since it is well to take account of all cases, I do not propose to
shelve the question. I suppose then an exceedingly corrupt state,
whereby the difficulty will clearly be intensified, since in it there will be
found neither laws nor institutions which will suffice to check widespread
corruption. Because, just as for the maintenance of good customs laws
are required, so if laws are to be observed, there is need of good customs.
Furthermore, institutions and laws made in the early days of a republic
when men were good, no longer serve their purpose when men have
become bad. And, if by any chance the laws of the state are changed,
there will never, or but rarely, be a change in its institutions. The
result is that new laws are ineffectual, because the institutions, which
remain constant, corrupt them.

In order to make this point more clear I would point out that in
Rome there was a constitution regulating its government, or rather its
form of government, and then laws enabling the magistrates to keep
the citizens in order. To the constitution determining its form of gov-

GOVERNMENT 155

ernment pertained the authority vested in the people, the senate, the
tribunes, and in the consuls, the method of applying for and of ap
pointing to magisterial posts, and its legislative procedure. These
institutions underwent little or no change in the course of events,
whereas there were changes in the laws which kept the citizens in order.
There was, for instance, the law concerning adultery, the sumptuary
law, a law concerning ambition, and many others. These laws were
introduced step by step as the citizens became corrupt. But since the
institutions determining its form of government remained unchanged
and, when corruption had set in, were no longer good, these modifica
tions of the laws did not suffice to keep men good, though they might
have helped had the introduction of new laws been accompanied by
a modification of the institutions.

That it is true to say that such institutions would not be good in a
corrupted state is clearly seen in two important cases, in the appointing
of magistrates and in the making of laws. The Roman people had
never given the consulate or any other important office in the city
except to such as had applied for the post. This institution was at the
outset good, because only such citizens applied for posts as judged
themselves worthy to fill them, and to be rejected was looked upon as
ignominious; so that everybody who was judged worthy, behaved well.
This procedure, when the city became corrupt, was extremely harmful;
because not those who had more virtue, but those who had more power,
applied for magistracies, and the powerless, though virtuous, refrained
from applying through fear. This inconvenience did not come about
all at once, but by stages, as is the case with all inconveniences. For
when the Romans had conquered Africa and Asia, and had reduced
the greater part of Greece to subjection, they had become secure as
to their liberty nor had they any more enemies whom there was ground
to fear. This sense of security and this weakness on the part of their
enemies caused the Roman people in appointing to the consulate to
consider not a man's virtue, but his popularity. This drew to that office
men who knew better how to get round men, not those who knew better
how to conquer enemies. They then turned from those who had more
popularity and gave it to those who had more power. Thus owing
to the defectiveness of this institution it came about that good men were
wholly excluded from consular rank.

Again, a tribune or any other citizen could propose to the people a
law, in regard to which every citizen was entitled to speak either in
favour of it or against, prior to a decision being reached. This institu
tion was good so long as the citizens were good, because it is always a
good thing that anyone anxious to serve the public should be able to
propose his plan. It is also a good thing that everyone should be at
liberty to express his opinion on it, so that when the people have heard



156 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLI^ WORK

what each has to say they may choose the best plan. But when the
citizens had become perverse, this institution became a nuisance; be
cause only the powerful proposed laws, and this for the sake, not of
their common liberties, but to augment their own power. And against
such projects no one durst speak for fear of such folk; with the result
that the people were induced, either by deceit or by force, to adopt
measures which spelt their own ruin.

In order to maintain Rome's liberty, therefore, when corruption
had set in, it was necessary in the course of its development to introduce
new institutions just as there had been made new laws; for different
institutions and a different procedure should be prescribed for the
governed according as they are good or bad, since similar forms can
not subsist in matter which is disposed in a contrary manner. Now
defective institutions must either be renovated all at once as soon as
the decline from goodness is noticed, or little by little before they be
come known to everybody. Neither of which courses is possible, I
maintain. For if the renovation is to take place little by little, there is
need of someone who shall see the inconvenience coming while yet it
is far off and in its infancy. But it may quite easily happen in a state
that no such person will ever arise, or, should he arise in point of fact,
that he will never be able to persuade others to see things as he does
himself, for men accustomed to a certain mode of life are reluctant to
change it, especially when they have not themselves noticed the evil
in question, but have had their attention called to it by conjectures.
While with regard to modifying institutions all at once when everybody
realises that they are no good, I would point out that, though it is easy
to recognise their futility, it is not easy to correct it; for, to do this,
normal methods will not suffice now that normal methods are bad.
Hence it is necessary to resort to extraordinary methods, such as the
use of force and an appeal to arms, and, before doing anything, to
become a prince in the state, so that one can dispose it as one thinks fit.

But, to reconstitute political life in a state presupposes a good man,
whereas to have recourse to violence in order to make oneself prince in a
republic supposes a bad man. Hence very rarely will there be found a
good man ready to use bad methods in order to make himself prince,
though with a good end in view, nor yet a bad man who, having be
come a prince, is ready to do the right thing and to whose mind it will
occur to use well that authority which he has acquired by bad means.

It is on account of all this that it is difficult, or rather impossible,
either to maintain a republican form of government in states which
have become corrupt or to create such a form afresh. Should a republic
simply have to be created or to be maintained, it would be necessary to
introduce into it a form of government akin rather to a monarchy than
to a democracy, so that those men whose arrogance is such that they



i. *x 

WARFARE 157

cannot be corrected by legal processes, may yet be restrained to some
extent by a quasi-regal power. To try to make them become good in
any other way would be either a most brutal or an impossible under
takingthe kind of thing that Cleomenes did, as I said above; for that
he might rule alone, he killed the ephors, and for the same reasons
Romulus killed his brother and Titus Tatius the Sabine, and afterwards
both of them made good use of their authority. It should, however, be
noted that neither the one nor the other had subjects steeped in corrup
tion, which in this chapter we have taken as the basis of our argument;
so that both were able to resolve on such steps, and, having done so, to
camouflage their plan.

Machiavellian Realism: The Dictates of the Times

Warfare

Unstable conditions in early sixteenth-century Italy precluded the
possibility of establishing Machiavelli*s beloved Republican govern
ment in Florence; however, Machiavelli recognized that changing
conditions demand different solutions. Two of the most pressing
problems facing Florence concerned its inability to organize and
maintain an efficient army and to preserve a stable and effective
government. With regard to the first of these problems, Machiavelli
advised that the contemporary system of mercenary warfare was the
source of military inefficiency and argued for the reestablishment of the
citizen army that had been abandoned in Dante's day. As for
government, he concluded that only a strong prince could effectively
rule in such turbulent times. The following selections present his
ideas on both of these subjects.

Italian wars enrich mercenaries and impoverish people.

Those who make war have always and very naturally designed to
enrich themselves and impoverish the enemy; neither is victory sought
or conquest desirable, excepting to strengthen themselves and weaken
the enemy. Hence it follows that those who are impoverished by victory
or debilitated by conquest must either have gone beyond or fallen short
of the end for which wars are made. A republic or a prince is enriched
by the victories he obtains, when the enemy is crushed and possession
is retained of the plunder and ransom. Victory is injurious when the
foe escapes, or when the soldiers appropriate the booty and ransom.
In such a case, losses are unfortunate, and conquests still more so; for
the vanquished suffers the injuries inflicted by the enemy, and the
victor those occasioned by his friends, which being less justifiable, must

cause the greater pain, particularly from a consideration of his being
thus compelled to oppress his people by an increased burden of taxa
tion. A ruler possessing any degree of humanity cannot rejoice in a
victory that afflicts his subjects. The victories of the ancient and well-
organized republics, enabled them to fill their treasuries with gold and
silver won from their enemies, to distribute gratuities to the people,
reduce taxation, and by games and solemn festivals, disseminate uni
versal joy. But the victories obtained in the times of which we speak,
first emptied the treasury, and then impoverished the people, without
giving the victorious party security from the enemy. This arose entirely
from the disorders inherent in their mode of warfare; for the vanquished
soldiery, divesting themselves of their accoutrements, and being neither
slain nor detained prisoners, only deferred a renewed attack on the
conqueror, till their leader had furnished them with arms and horses.
Besides this, both ransom and booty being appropriated by the troops,
the victorious princes could not make use of them for raising fresh
forces, but were compelled to draw the necessary means from their
subjects' purses, and this was the only result of victory experienced by
the people, except that it diminished the ruler's reluctance to such a
course, and made him less particular about his mode of oppressing
them. To such a state had the practice of war been brought by the
sort of soldiery then on foot, that the victor and the vanquished, when
desirous of their services, alike needed fresh supplies of money; for the
one had to re-equip them, and the other to bribe them; the vanquished
could not fight without being remounted, and the conquerors would
not take the field without a new gratuity. Hence it followed that the
one derived little advantage from the victory, and the other was the
less injured by defeat; for the routed party had to be re-equipped, and
the victorious could not pursue his advantage.

Men, not riches, are the sinews of war.

Since it is open to anyone having the requisite authority to begin a
war but not to end it, a ruler before committing himself to such an
undertaking should calculate what forces he has at his disposal and act
accordingly. Moreover, he should also take good care not to make
any mistake about such forces, as he will do every time he bases his
calculations on money or on the terrain or on the goodwill of men, but,
on the other hand, lacks troops of his own. For though such things
undoubtedly add to your strength, they certainly do not provide you
with it; and, as such, are nought and of no avail without faithful

troops. For, without these no amount of money will suffice you: the
natural strength of the country will not help you; nor will the goodwill
of men last, since they cannot remain faithful to you unless you are
able to protect them. Every mountain, every lake, every inaccessible
fastness, becomes but as a plain, when strong defenders are lacking.
Money, too, not only affords you no protection, but makes you the
sooner fall a prey. Nor can any opinion be more false than that which
asserts that money is the sinews of war.

This view was advocated by Quintus Curtius in connection with
the war which took place between Antipater, the Macedonian, and
the king of Sparta; where he tells how, for want of money, the king of
Sparta of necessity had to join battle, and was beaten; whereas, had he
postponed the battle for a few days, he would have had news from
Greece of the death of Alexander, and so would have remained the
victor without putting up a fight. But, since he was without funds and
feared lest for lack of them his army might desert, he was forced to try
his luck in battle. On which ground Quintus Curtius maintains that
money is the sinews of war.

The view adopted by Quintus Curtius is put forward daily, and is
followed by rulers whose prudence is not up to the mark. Taking this
as their basic principle, they think they can defend themselves if they
have a well-filled treasury, and do not consider that, if treasures guaran
teed victory, Darius would have conquered Alexander, the Greeks
would have conquered the Romans, in our day Duke Charles would
have conquered the Swiss, nor yet, but a few days ago, would the com
bined forces of the Pope and the Florentines have had any difficulty in
overcoming Francesco Maria, the nephew of Julius II, in the war of
Urbino. Yet all those mentioned were overcome by those who held
that the sinews of war lay not in money, but in good soldiers.

Amongst the other things that Croesus, king of Lydia, showed to
Solon, the Athenian, was a treasure too great to count. Solon was then
asked what opinion he had formed of the king's power, to which he
replied that he did not think him more powerful on this account, for
war is made with steel, not with gold, and, if anyone came along who
had more steel than he had, he could deprive him of his power.

Again, when, after the death of Alexander the Great, a host of Gauls
crossed into Greece, and then to Asia, and sent ambassadors to arrange
a treaty with the king of Macedonia, the king, in order to display his
power and to frighten them, showed them a lot of gold and silver;
whereupon the Gauls who up till then had been intent on peace, broke
off negotiations, so eager were they to relieve him of that gold. So the
king was despoiled on account of the very thing he had accumulated
for his defence.

The Venetians, a few years ago, also had a well-filled treasury, yet



160 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLl's WORK

lost all their dominions without being able to use their treasures to
defend them.

I assert, then, that it is not gold, as is acclaimed by common opinion,
that constitutes the sinews of war, but good soldiers; for gold does not
find good soldiers, but good soldiers are quite capable of finding gold.
If the Romans had chosen to wage war rather by means of money than
by the sword, not all the treasure in the world would have sufficed in
view of the great enterprises they undertook and the difficulties they
had to encounter in them. But, since they made war with the sword,
they did not suffer for want of gold, because those who were afraid of
them brought it right into their camps. And if that Spartan king for
lack of money had to try his luck in battle, what happened to him on
the score of money has very often happened for other reasons; for it is
obvious that, when an army is short of provisions and must needs either
die of hunger or fight, it always chooses to fight, since this is the more
honourable course, and one that gives fortune some chance to show
you favour. Again, it often happens that when a general sees that the
enemy's army is about to be reinforced, he must either engage it and
try his fortune in battle, or wait till the enemy's force has increased,
and then have to fight it anyhow to his own great disadvantage. One
sees, tooas happened to Hasdrubal when he was attacked jointly by
Claudius Nero and the other Roman consul in the Marchhow a

general who is obliged either to run away or to fight, always chooses to
fight, since it seems to him that this course, even should the issue be
extremely doubtful, gives him a chance to win, whereas the other
would mean losing in any case. There are, then, many situations
which compel a general to prefer the alternative of fighting even though
he had no intention of so doing, of which lack of money may sometimes
be one. But one ought not for this reason to infer that money is the
sinews of war, any more than are other situations which place men in a
like predicament.

I repeat, therefore: gold is not the sinews of war, but good soldiers
are. Gold is necessary, but is of secondary importance, and good
soldiers can get it for themselves; for it is as impossible for good soldiers
to fail to find gold as it is for gold to find good soldiers. That in this
we are speaking the truth history shows again and again, in spite of the
fact that Pericles advised the Athenians to wage war with the whole of
the Peloponnese on the ground that their industry and their pecuniary
resources should enable them to win it. And, though during the war
the Athenians sometimes prospered, in the end they lost, so that Sparta's
wisdom and good soldiery was worth more than Athens' industry and
money. On this point Titus Livy is a better witness than anybody else.
I refer to the passage in which he discusses whether, if Alexander the
Great had come to Italy, he would have beaten the Romans. In it he



the prince 161

points out that three things are necessary for war; plenty of good sol
diers, wise generals, and good luck; and then, having enquired whether
the Romans or Alexander was the better off in these things, he draws
his conclusion without any mention of money. The Capuans, at that
time the richest of the Sidicines who took up arms against the Samnites,
must have calculated their strength on a monetary basis, and not on
the basis of troops, for, when they decided to help them, after being
twice routed, they were forced to become Rome's tributaries if they
wished to survive.

The Prince

CHAPTER 7

Concerning new principalities which are acquired
either by the arms of others or by good fortune.
Those who solely by good fortune become princes from being private
citizens have little trouble in rising, but much in keeping atop; they
have not any difficulties on the way up, because they fly, but they have
many when they reach the summit. Such are those to whom some state
is given either for money or by the favour of him who bestows it; as
happened to many in Greece, in the cities of Ionia and of the Helles
pont, where princes were made by Darius, in order that they might
hold the cities both for his security and his glory; as also were those
emperors who, by the corruption of the soldiers, from being citizens
came to empire. Such stand simply upon the goodwill and the fortune
of him who has elevated themtwo most inconstant and unstable

things. Neither have they the knowledge requisite for the position;
because, unless they are men of great worth and ability, it is not reason
able to expect that they should know how to command, having always
lived in a private condition; besides, they cannot hold it because they
have not forces which they can keep friendly and faithful.

States that rise unexpectedly, then, like all other things in nature
which are born and grow rapidly, cannot have their foundations and
correspondencies fixed in such a way that the first storm will not over
throw them; unless, as is said, those who unexpectedly become princes
are men of so much ability that they know they have to be prepared

t

at once to hold that which fortune has thrown into their laps, and that
those foundations, which others have laid before they became princes,
they must lay afterwards.

Concerning these two methods of rising to be a prince by ability or
fortune, I wish to adduce two examples within our own recollection, and

these are Francesco Sforza and Cesare Borgia. Francesco, by proper
means and with great ability, from being a private person rose to be
Duke of Milan, and that which he had acquired with a thousand
anxieties he kept with little trouble. On the other hand, Cesare Borgia,
called by the people Duke Valentino, acquired his State during the
ascendency of his father, and on its decline he lost it, notwithstanding
that he had taken every measure and done all that ought to be done
by a wise and able man to fix firmly his roots in the states which the
arms and fortunes of others had bestowed on him.

Because, as is stated above, he who has not first laid his foundations
may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards, but they will be
laid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building. If, there
fore, all the steps taken by the duke be considered, it will be seen that he
laid solid foundations for his future power, and I do not consider it
superfluous to discuss them, because I do not know what better precepts
to give a new prince than the example of his actions; and if his disposi
tions were of no avail, that was not his fault, but the extraordinary and
extreme malignity of fortune.

Alexander the Sixth, in wishing to aggrandise the duke, his son, had
many immediate and prospective difficulties. Firstly, he did not see his
way to make him master of any state that was not a state of the Church;
and if he was willing to rob the Church he knew that the Duke of
Milan and the Venetians would not consent, because Faenza and
Rimini were already under the protection of the Venetians. Besides
this, he saw the arms of Italy, especially those by which he might have
been assisted, in hands that would fear the aggrandisement of the Pope,
namely, the Orsini and the Colonnesi and their following. It behoved
him, therefore, to upset this state of affairs and embroil the powers, so as
to make himself securely master of part of their states. This was easy
for him to do, because he found the Venetians, moved by other reasons,
inclined to bring back the French into Italy; he would not only not
oppose this, but he would render it more easy by dissolving the former
marriage of King Louis. Therefore the king came into Italy with the
assistance of the Venetians and the consent of Alexander. He was no
sooner in Milan than the Pope had soldiers from him for the attempt
on the Romagna, which yielded to him on the reputation of the king.
The duke, therefore, having acquired the Romagna and beaten the
Colonnesi, while wishing to hold that and to advance further, was
hindered by two things : the one, his forces did not appear loyal to him,
the other, the goodwill of France: that is to say, he feared that the
forces of the Orsini, which he was using, would not stand to him, that
not only might they hinder him from winning more, but might them
selves seize what he had won, and that the king might also do the same.
Of the Orsini he had a warning when, after taking Faenza and attack-



THE PRINCE 163

ing Bologna, he saw them go very unwillingly to that attack. And as to
the king, he learned his mind when he himself, after taking the Duchy of
Urbino, attacked Tuscany, and the king made him desist from that
undertaking; hence the duke decided to depend no more upon the
arms and the luck of others.

For the first thing he weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in
Rome, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen,
making them his gentlemen, giving them good pay, and, according to
their rank, honouring them with office and command in such a way
that in a few months all attachment to the factions was destroyed
and turned entirely to the duke. After this he awaited an opportunity
to crush the Orsini, having scattered the adherents of the Colonna
house. This came to him soon and he used it well; for the Orsini, per
ceiving at length that the aggrandisement of the duke and the Church
was ruin to them, called a meeting at Magione in Perugia. From this
sprung the rebellion at Urbino and the tumults in the Romagna, with
endless dangers to the duke, all of which he overcame with the help of
the French. Having restored his authority, not to leave it at risk by
trusting either to the French or other outside forces, he had recourse to
his wiles, and he knew so well how to conceal his mind that, by the
mediation of Signor Pagolowhom the duke did not fail to secure with
all kinds of attentions, giving him money, apparel, and horsesthe
Orsini were reconciled, so that their simplicity brought them into his
power at Sinigalia. Having exterminated the leaders, and turned
their partisans into his friends, the duke had laid sufficiently good
foundations to his power, having all the Romagna and the Duchy of
Urbino; and the people now beginning to appreciate their prosperity,
he gained them all over to himself. And as this point is worthy of
notice, and to be imitated by others, I am not willing to leave it out.

When the duke occupied the Romagna he found it under the rule of
weak masters, who rather plundered their subjects than ruled them, and
gave them more cause for disunion than for union, so that the country
was full of robbery, quarrels, and every kind of violence; and so,
wishing to bring back peace and obedience to authority, he considered
it necessary to give it a good governor. Thereupon he promoted
Messer Ramiro d'Orco, a swift and cruel man, to whom he gave the
fullest power. This man in a short time restored peace and unity with

\

the greatest success. Afterwards the duke considered that it was not
advisable to confer such excessive authority, for he had no doubt but
that he would become odious, so he set up a court of judgment in the
country, under a most excellent president, wherein all cities had their
advocates. And because he knew that the past severity had caused
some hatred against himself, so, to clear himself in the minds of the
people, and gain them entirely to himself, he desired to show that, if



164 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLI^ wwrv

any cruelty had been practised, it had not originated with him, but
in the natural sternness of the minister. Under this pretence he took
Ramiro, and one morning caused him to be executed and left on the
piazza at Cesena with the block and a bloody knife at his side. The
barbarity of this spectacle caused the people to be at once satisfied and
dismayed.

But let us return whence we started. I say that the duke, finding
himself now sufficiently powerful and partly secured from immediate
dangers by having armed himself in his own way, and having in a great
measure crushed those forces in his vicinity that could injure him if he
wished to proceed with his conquest, had next to consider France, for
he knew that the king, who too late was aware of his mistake, would
not support him. And from this time he began to seek new alliances
and to temporise with France in the expedition which she was making
towards the kingdom of Naples against the Spaniards who were be
sieging Gaeta. It was his intention to secure himself against them,
and this he would have quickly accomplished had Alexander lived.

Such was his line of action as to present affairs. But as to the future
he had to fear, in the first place, that a new successor to the Church
might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that
which Alexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways.
Firstly, by exterminating the families of those lords whom he had
despoiled, so as to take away that pretext from the Pope. Secondly, by
winning to himself all the gentlemen of Rome, so as to be able to curb
the Pope with their aid, as has been observed. Thirdly, by converting
the college more to himself. Fourthly, by acquiring so much power
before the Pope should die that he could by his own measures resist
the first shock. Of these four things, at the death of Alexander, he had
accomplished three. For he had killed as many of the dispossessed
lords as he could lay hands on, and few had escaped; he had won over
the Roman gentlemen, and he had the most numerous party in the
college. And as to any fresh acquisition, he intended to become master
of Tuscany, for he already possessed Perugia and Piombino, and Pisa
was under his protection. And as he had no longer to study France
(for the French were already driven out of the kingdom of Naples by
the Spaniards, and in this way both were compelled to buy his good
will), he pounced down upon Pisa. After this, Lucca and Siena yielded
at once, partly through hatred and partly through fear of the Floren
tines; and the Florentines would have had no remedy had he continued
to prosper, as he was prospering the year that Alexander died, for he
had acquired so much power and reputation that he would have stood
by himself, and no longer have depended on the luck and the forces of
others, but solely on his own power and ability.



THE PRINCE 165

But Alexander died five years after he had first drawn the sword. He
left the duke with the state of Romagna alone consolidated, with the
rest in the air, between two most powerful hostile armies, and sick unto
death. Yet there were in the duke such boldness and ability, and
he knew so well how men are to be won or lost, and so firm were the
foundations which in so short a time he had laid, that if he had not had
those armies on his back, or if he had been in good health, he would
have overcome all difficulties. And it is seen that his foundations were

good, for the Romagna awaited him for more than a month. In Rome,
although but half alive, he remained secure; and whilst the Baglioni,
the Vitelli, and the Orsini might come to Rome, they could not effect
anything against him. If he could not have made Pope him whom he
wished, at least the one whom he did not wish would not have been
elected. But if he had been in sound health at the death of Alexander,
everything would have been easy to him. On the day that Julius the
Second was elected, he told me that he had thought of everything that
might occur at the death of his father, and had provided a remedy for
all, except that he had never anticipated that, when the death did
happen, he himself would be on the point to die.

When all the actions of the duke are recalled, I do not know how to
blame him, but rather it appears to me, as I have said, that I ought to
offer him for imitation to all those who, by the fortune or the arms of
others, are raised to government. Because he, having a lofty spirit and
far-reaching aims, could not have regulated his conduct otherwise, and
only the shortness of the life of Alexander and his own sickness frus
trated his designs. Therefore, he who considers it necessary to secure
himself in his new principality, to win friends, to overcome either by
force or fraud, to make himself beloved and feared by the people, to be
followed and revered by the soldiers, to exterminate those who had
power or reason to hurt him, to change the old order of things for new,
to be severe and gracious, magnanimous and liberal, to destroy a
disloyal soldiery and to create new, to maintain friendship with kings
and princes in such a way that they must help him with zeal and offend
with caution, cannot find a more lively example than the actions of
this man.

Only can he be blamed for the election of Julius the Second, in
whom he made a bad choice, because, as is said, not being able to elect
a Pope to his own mind, he could have hindered any other from being
elected Pope; and he ought never to have consented to the election of
any cardinal whom he had injured or who had cause to fear him if they
became pontiffs. For men injure either from fear or hatred. Those
whom he had injured, amongst others, were San Pietro ad Vincula,
Colonna, San Giorgio, and Ascanio. The rest, in becoming Pope, had



166 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLl's WORK

to fear him, Rouen and the Spaniards excepted; the latter from their
relationship and obligations, the former from his influence, the kingdom
of France having relations with him. Therefore, above everything,
the duke ought to have created a Spaniard Pope, and, failing him, he
ought to have consented to Rouen and not San Pietro ad Vincula.
He who believes that new benefits will cause great personages to forget
old injuries is deceived. Therefore, the duke erred in his choice, and
it was the cause of his ultimate ruin.

CHAPTER 12

How many kinds of soldiery there are, and
concerning mercenaries.

Having discoursed particularly on the characteristics of such princi
palities as in the beginning I proposed to discuss, and having considered
in some degree the causes of their being good or bad, and having shown
the methods by which many have sought to acquire them and to hold
them, it now remains for me to discuss generally the means of offence
and defence which belong to each of them.

We have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have his
foundations well laid, otherwise it follows of necessity he will go to ruin.
The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old or composite, are
good laws and good arms; and as there cannot be good laws where the
state is not well armed, it follows that where they are well armed they
have good laws. I shall leave the laws out of the discussion and shall
speak of the arms.

I say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state
are either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed.
Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds
his state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe; for
they are disunited, ambitious and without discipline, unfaithful, valiant
before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither the fear of
God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only so long as the
attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war by the enemy.
The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for keeping the field
than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to make them willing
to die for you. They are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do
not make war, but if war comes they take themselves off or run from
the foe; which I should have little trouble to prove, for the ruin of Italy
has been caused by nothing else than by resting all her hopes for many
years on mercenaries, and although they formerly made some display
and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet when the foreigners
came they showed what they were. Thus it was that Charles, King of
France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in hand; and he who told
us that our sins were the cause of it told the truth, but they were not the



THE PRINCE 167

sins he imagined, but those which I have related. And as they were the
sins of princes, it is the princes who have also suffered the penalty.

I wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms. The
mercenary captains are either capable men or they are not; if they are,
you cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own great
ness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or others contrary
to your intentions; but if the captain is not skilful, you are ruined in
the usual way.

And if it be urged that whoever is armed will act in the same way,
whether mercenary or not, I reply that when arms have to be resorted
to, either by a prince or a republic, then the prince ought to go in
person and perform the duty of captain; the republic has to send its
citizens, and when one is sent who does not turn out satisfactorily, it
ought to recall him, and when one is worthy, to hold him by the laws
so that he does not leave the command. And experience has shown
princes and republics, single-handed, making the greatest progress,
and mercenaries doing nothing except damage; and it is more difficult
to bring a republic, armed with its own arms, under the sway of one
of its citizens than it is to bring one armed with foreign arms. Rome
and Sparta stood for many ages armed and free. The Switzers are
completely armed and quite free.

Of ancient mercenaries, for example, there are the Carthaginians,
who were oppressed by their mercenary soldiers after the first war with
the Romans, although the Carthaginians had their own citizens for
captains. After the death of Epaminondas, Philip of Macedn was
made captain of their soldiers by the Thebans, and after victory he
took away their liberty.

Duke Filippo being dead, the Milanese enlisted Francesco Sforza
against the Venetians, and he, having overcome the enemy at Caravag
gio, allied himself with them to crush the Milanese, his masters. His
father, Sforza, having been engaged by Queen Johanna of Naples, left
her unprotected, so that she was forced to throw herself into the arms
of the King of Aragn, in order to save her kingdom. And if the Vene
tians and Florentines formerly extended their dominions by these arms,
and yet their captains did not make themselves princes, but have
defended them, I reply that the Florentines in this case have been
favoured by chance, for of the able captains, of whom they might have
stood in fear, some have not conquered, some have been opposed, and
others have turned their ambitions elsewhere. One who did not con

quer was Giovanni Acuto, and since he did not conquer his fidelity
cannot be proved; but every one will acknowledge that, had he con
quered, the Florentines would have stood at his discretion. Sforza had
the Bracceschi always against him, so they watched each other. Fran
cesco turned his ambition to Lombardy; Braccio against the Church



168 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLI^ WORK

and the kingdom of Naples. But let us come to that which happened a
short while ago. The Florentines appointed as their captain Pagolo
Vitelli, a most prudent man, who from a private position had risen to
the greatest renown. If this man had taken Pisa, nobody can deny that
it would have been proper for the Florentines to keep in with him, for
if he became the soldier of their enemies they had no means of resisting,
and if they held to him they must obey him. The Venetians, if their
achievements are considered, will be seen to have acted safely and
gloriously so long as they sent to war their own men, when with armed
gentlemen and plebeians they did valiantly. This was before they
turned to enterprises on land, but when they began to fight on land
they forsook this virtue and followed the custom of Italy. And in the
beginning of their expansion on land, through not having much terri
tory, and because of their great reputation, they had not much to fear
from their captains; but when they expanded, as under Carmignuola,
they had a taste of this mistake; for, having found him a most valiant
man (they beat the Duke of Milan under his leadership), and, on the
other hand, knowing how lukewarm he was in the war, they feared
they would no longer conquer under him, and for this reason they were
not willing, nor were they able, to let him go; and so, not to lose again
that which they had acquired, they were compelled, in order to secure
themselves, to murder him. They had afterwards for their captains
Bartolomeo da Bergamo, Roberto da San Severino, the Count of
Pitigliano, and the like, under whom they had to dread loss and not
gain, as happened afterwards at Vaila, where in one battle they lost
that which in eight hundred years they had acquired with so much
trouble. Because from such arms conquests come but slowly, long
delayed and inconsiderable, but the losses sudden and portentous.

And as with these examples I have reached Italy, which has been
ruled for many years by mercenaries, I wish to discuss them more seri
ously, in order that, having seen their rise and progress, one may be
better prepared to counteract them. You must understand that the
empire has recently come to be repudiated in Italy, that the Pope has
acquired more temporal power, and that Italy has been divided up into
more states, for the reason that many of the great cities took up arms
against their nobles, who, formerly favoured by the emperor, were
oppressing them, whilst the Church was favouring them so as to gain
authority in temporal power: in many others their citizens became
princes. From this it came to pass that Italy fell partly into the hands
of the Church and of republics, and, the Church consisting of priests
and the republic of citizens unaccustomed to arms, both commenced
to enlist foreigners.

The first who gave renown to this soldiery was Alberigo da Conio,



 

THE PRINCE 169

the Romagnian. From the school of this man sprang, among others,
Braccio and Sforza, who in their time were the arbiters of Italy. After
these came all the other captains who till now have directed the arms
of Italy; and the end of all their valour has been, that she has been
over-run by Charles, robbed by Louis, ravaged by Ferdinand, and in
sulted by the Switzers. The principle that has guided them has been,
first, to lower the credit of infantry so that they might increase their
own. They did this because, subsisting on their pay and without terri
tory, they were unable to support many soldiers, and a few infantry did
not give them any authority; so they were led to employ cavalry, with
a moderate force of which they were maintained and honoured; and
affairs were brought to such a pass that, in an army of twenty thousand
soldiers, there were not to be found two thousand foot soldiers. They
had, besides this, used every art to lessen fatigue and danger to them
selves and their soldiers, not killing in the fray, but taking prisoners
and liberating without ransom. They did not attack towns at night,
nor did the garrisons of the towns attack encampments at night; they
did not surround the camp either with stockade or ditch, nor did they
campaign in the winter. All these things were permitted by their
military rules, and devised by them to avoid, as I have said, both fatigue
and dangers; thus they have brought Italy to slavery and contempt.

CHAPTE R 1 3

Concerning auxiliaries, mixed soldiery, and one's own.

Auxiliaries, which are the other useless arm, are employed when a
prince is called in with his forces to aid and defend, as was done by Pope
Julius in the most recent times; for he, having, in the enterprise against
Ferrara, had poor proof of his mercenaries, turned to auxiliaries, and
stipulated with Ferdinand, King of Spain, for his assistance with men
and arms. These arms may be useful and good in themselves, but for
him who calls them in they are always disadvantageous; for losing, one
is undone, and winning, one is their captive.

And although ancient histories may be full of examples, I do not
wish to leave this recent one of Pope Julius the Second, the peril of
which cannot fail to be perceived; for he, wishing to get Ferrara, threw
himself entirely into the hands of the foreigner. But his good fortune
brought about a third event, so that he did not reap the fruit of his
rash choice; because, having his auxiliaries routed at Ravenna, and the
Switzers having risen and driven out the conquerors (against all ex
pectation, both his and others), it so came to pass that he did not be
come prisoner to his enemies, they having fled, nor to his auxiliaries,
he having conquered by other arms than theirs.

The Florentines, being entirely without arms, sent ten thousand



170 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLI^ WORK

Frenchmen to take Pisa, whereby they ran more danger than at any
other time of their troubles.

The Emperor of Constantinople, to oppose his neighbours, sent ten
thousand Turks into Greece, who, on the war being finished, were not
willing to quit; this was the beginning of the servitude of Greece to the
infidels.

Therefore, let him who has no desire to conquer make use of these
arms, for they are much more hazardous than mercenaries, because with
them the ruin is ready made; they are all united, all yield obedience to
others; but with mercenaries, when they have conquered, more time
and better opportunities are needed to injure you; they are not all of
one community, they are found and paid by you, and a third party,
which you have made their head, is not able all at once to assume
enough authority to injure you. In conclusion, in mercenaries dastardy
is most dangerous; in auxiliaries, valour. The wise prince, therefore,
has always avoided these arms and turned to his own; and has been
willing rather to lose with them than to conquer with others, not deem
ing that a real victory which is gained with the arms of others.

I shall never hesitate to cite Cesare Borgia and his actions. This
duke entered the Romagna with auxiliaries, taking there only French
soldiers, and with them he captured Imola and Forli; but afterwards,
such forces not appearing to him reliable, he turned to mercenaries,
discerning less danger in them, and enlisted the Orsini and Vitelli;
whom presently, on handling and finding them doubtful; unfaithful,
and dangerous, he destroyed and turned to his own men. And the
difference between one and the other of these forces can easily be seen
when one considers the difference there was in the reputation of the
duke, when he had the French, when he had the Orsini and Vitelli,
and when he relied on his own soldiers, on whose fidelity he could
always count and found it ever increasing; he was never esteemed more
highly than when every one saw that he was complete master of his
own forces.

I was not intending to go beyond Italian and recent examples, but
I am unwilling to leave out Hiero, the Syracusan, he being one of those
I have named above. This man, as I have said, made head of the army
by the Syracusans, soon found out that a mercenary soldiery, consti
tuted like our Italian condottieri, was of no use; and it appearing to him
that he could neither keep them nor let them go, he had them all cut
to pieces, and afterwards made war with his own forces and not with
aliens.

I wish also to recall to memory an instance from the Old Testament
applicable to this subject. David offered himself to Saul to fight with
Goliath, the Philistine champion, and, to give him courage, Saul armed
him with his own weapons; which David rejected as soon as he had



THE PRINCE 171

them on his back, saying he could make no use of them, and that he
wished to meet the enemy with his sling and his knife. In conclusion,
the arms of others either fall from your back, or they weigh you down,
or they bind you fast.

Charles the Seventh, the father of King Louis the Eleventh, having
by good fortune and valour liberated France from the English, recog
nised the necessity of being armed with forces of his own, and he estab
lished in his kingdom ordinances concerning men-at-arms and infantry.
Afterwards his son, King Louis, abolished the infantry and began to
enlist the Switzers, which mistake, followed by others, is, as is now seen,
a source of peril to that kingdom; because, having raised the reputation
of the Switzers, he has entirely diminished the value of his own arms,
for he has destroyed the infantry altogether; and his men-at-arms he has
subordinated to others, for, being as they are so accustomed to fight
along with Switzers, it does not appear that they can now conquer
without them. Hence it arises that the French cannot stand against
the Switzers, and without the Switzers they do not come off well
against others. The armies of the French have thus become mixed,
partly mercenary and partly national, both of which arms together are
much better than mercenaries alone or auxiliaries alone, yet much
inferior to one's own forces. And this example proves it, for the king
dom of France would be unconquerable if the ordinance of Charles
had been enlarged or maintained.

But the scanty wisdom of man, on entering into an affair which
looks well at first, cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it, as I
have said above of hectic fevers. Therefore, if he who rules a princi
pality cannot recognise evils until they are upon him, he is not truly
wise; and this insight is given to few. And if the first disaster to the
Roman Empire should be examined, it will be found to have com
menced only with the enlisting of the Goths; because from that time
the vigour of the Roman Empire began to decline, and all that valour
which had raised it passed away to others.

I conclude, therefore, that no principality is secure without having
its own forces; on the contrary, it is entirely dependent on good for
tune, not having the valour which in adversity would defend it. And
it has always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing
can be so uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its
own strength. And one's own forces are those which are composed
either of subjects, citizens, or dependents; all others are mercenaries
or auxiliaries. And the way to make ready one's own forces will be
easily found if the rules suggested by me shall be reflected upon, and
if one will consider how Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, and
many republics and princes have armed and organised themselves, to
which rules I entirely commit myself.

CHAPTER 14

That which concerns a prince on the subject of the art of war.
A prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything
else for his study, than war and its rules and discipline; for this is the
sole art that belongs to him who rules, and it is of such force that it
not only upholds those who are born princes, but it often enables men
to rise from a private station to that rank. And, on the contrary, it is
seen that when princes have thought more of ease than of arms they
have lost their states. And the first cause of your losing it is to neglect
this art; and what enables you to acquire a state is to be master of the
art. Francesco Sforza, through being martial, from a private person
became Duke of Milan; and the sons, through avoiding the hardships
and troubles of arms, from dukes became private persons. For among
other evils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to be de
spised, and this is one of those ignominies against which a prince ought
to guard himself, as is shown later on. Because there is nothing propor
tionate between the armed and the unarmed; and it is not reasonable
that he who is armed should yield obedience willingly to him who is
unarmed, or that the unarmed man should be secure among armed
servants. Because, there being in the one disdain and in the other
suspicion, it is not possible for them to work well together. And there
fore a prince who does not understand the art of war, over and above
the other misfortunes already mentioned, cannot be respected by his
soldiers, nor can he rely on them. He ought never, therefore, to have
out of his thoughts this subject of war, and in peace he should addict
himself more to its exercise than in war; this he can do in two ways, the
one by action, the other by study.

As regards action, he ought above all things to keep his men well
organised and drilled, to follow incessantly the chase, by which he ac
customs his body to hardships, and learns something of the nature of
localities, and gets to find out how the mountains rise, how the valleys
open out, how the plains lie, and to understand the nature of rivers
and marshes, and in all this to take the greatest care. Which knowledge
is useful in two ways. Firstly, he learns to know his country, and is
better able to undertake its defence; afterwards, by means of the knowl
edge and observation of that locality, he understands with ease any
other which it may be necessary for him to study hereafter; because the
hills, valleys, and plains, and rivers and marshes that are, for instance, in
Tuscany, have a certain resemblance to those of other countries, so
that with a knowledge of the aspect of one country one can easily
arrive at a knowledge of others. And the prince that lacks this skill
lacks the essential which it is desirable that a captain should possess, for
it teaches him to surprise his enemy, to select quarters, to lead armies,
to array the battle, to besiege towns to advantage.

THE PRINCE 173

Philopoemen, Prince of the Acheans, among other praises which
writers have bestowed on him, is commended because in time of peace
he never had anything in his mind but the rules of war; and when he
was in the country with friends, he often stopped and reasoned with
them: "If the enemy should be upon that hill, and we should find our
selves here with our army, with whom would be the advantage? How
should one best advance to meet him, keeping the ranks? If we should
wish to retreat, how ought we to set about it? If they should retreat,
how ought we to pursue?" And he would set forth to them, as he went,
all the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their
opinion and state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these con
tinual discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any unex
pected circumstances that he could not deal with.

But to exercise the intellect the prince should read histories, and
study there the actions of illustrious men, to see how they have borne
themselves in war, to examine the causes of their victories and defeat,
so as to avoid the latter and imitate the former; and above all do as an
illustrious man did, who took as an exemplar one who had been praised
and famous before him, and whose achievements and deeds he always
kept in his mind, as it is said Alexander the Great imitated Achilles,
Caesar Alexander, Scipio Cyrus. And whoever reads the life of Cyrus,
written by Xenophon, will recognise afterwards in the life of Scipio how
that imitation was his glory, and how in chastity, affability, humanity,
and liberality Scipio conformed to those things which have been written
of Cyrus by Xenophon. A wise prince ought to observe some such rules,
and never in peaceful times stand idle, but increase his resources with
industry in such a way that they may be available to him in adversity,
so that if fortune changes it may find him prepared to resist her blows.

CHAPTER 15

Concerning things for which men, and especially princes,
are praised or blamed.

It remains now to see what ought to be the rules of conduct for a prince
towards subject and friends. And as I know that many have written on
this point, I expect I shall be considered presumptuous in mentioning
it again, especially as in discussing it I shall depart from the methods
of other people. But, it being my intention to write a thing which
shall be useful to him who apprehends it, it appears to me more ap
propriate to follow up the real truth of a matter than the imagination
of it; for many have pictured republics and principalities which in
fact have never been known or seen, because how one lives is so far
distant from how one ought to live, that he who neglects what is done
for what ought to be done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation;

if



174 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLl's WORK

for a man who wishes to act entirely up to his professions of virtue soon
meets with what destroys him among so much that is evil.

Hence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know
how to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity.
Therefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince,
and discussing those which are real, I say that all men when they are
spoken of, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed, are re
markable for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or
praise; and thus it is that one is reputed liberal, another miserly, using
a Tuscan term (because an avaricious person in our language is still
he who desires to possess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly who
deprives himself too much of the use of his own) ; one is reputed gener
ous, one rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless, an
other faithful; one effeminate and cowardly, another bold and brave;
one affable, another haughty; one lascivious, another chaste; one
sincere, another cunning; one hard, another easy; one grave, another
frivolous; one religious, another unbelieving, and the like. And I know
that every one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a
prince to exhibit all the above qualities that are considered good; but
because they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for human
conditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to be sufficiently
prudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vices
which would lose him his state; and also to keep himself, if it be possible,
from those which would not lose him it; but this not being possible, he
may with less hesitation abandon himself to them. And again, he need
not make himself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices without
which the state can only be saved with difficulty, for if everything is
considered carefully, it will be found that something which looks like
virtue, if followed, would be his ruin; whilst something else, which looks
like vice, yet followed brings him security and prosperity.

CHAPTER 16

Concerning liberality and meanness.

Commencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I
say that it would be well to be reputed liberal. Nevertheless, liberality
exercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation for it, injures
you; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should be exercised, it may
not become known, and you will not avoid the reproach of its opposite.
Therefore, any one wishing to maintain among men the name of liberal
is obliged to avoid no attribute of magnificence; so that a prince thus
inclined will consume in such acts all his property, and will be com
pelled in the end, if he wish to maintain the name of liberal, to unduly
weigh down his people, and tax them, and do everything he can to get



THE PRINCE 175

money. This will soon make him odious to his subjects, and becoming
poor he will be little valued by any one; thus, with his liberality, having
offended many and rewarded few, he is affected by the very first
trouble and imperilled by whatever may be the first danger; recognis
ing this himself, and wishing to draw back from it, he runs at once into
the reproach of being miserly.

Therefore, a prince, not being able to exercise this virtue of liberality
in such a way that it is recognised, except to his cost, if he is wise he
ought not to fear the reputation of being mean, for in time he will come
to be more considered than if liberal, seeing that with his economy his
revenues are enough, that he can defend himself against all attacks, and
is able to engage in enterprises without burdening his people; thus it
comes to pass that he exercises liberality towards all from whom he
does not take, who are numberless, and meanness towards those to
whom he does not give, who are few.

We have not seen great things done in our time except by those who
have been considered mean; the rest have failed. Pope Julius the
Second was assisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for lib
erality, yet he did not strive afterwards to keep it up, when he made war
on the King of France; and he made many wars without imposing any
extraordinary tax on his subjects, for he supplied his additional ex
penses out of his long thriftiness. The present King of Spain would
not have undertaken or conquered in so many enterprises if he had been
reputed liberal. A prince, therefore, provided that he has not to rob
his subjects, that he can defend himself, that he does not become poor
and abject, that he is not forced to become rapacious, ought to hold
of little account a reputation for being mean, for it is one of those vices
which will enable him to govern.

And if any one should say: Caesar obtained empire by liberality,
and many others have reached the highest positions by having been
liberal, and by being considered so, I answer: Either you are a prince
in fact, or in a way to become one. In the first case this liberality is
dangerous, in the second it is very necessary to be considered liberal;
and Caesar was one of those who wished to become pre-eminent in
Rome; but if he had survived after becoming so, and had not moderated
his expenses, he would have destroyed his government. And if any
one should reply: Many have been princes, and have done great things
with armies, who have been considered very liberal, I reply: Either a
prince spends that which is his own or his subjects' or else that of
others. In the first case he ought to be sparing, in the second he ought
not to neglect any opportunity for liberality. And to the prince who
goes forth with his army, supporting it by pillage, sack, and extortion,
handling that which belongs to others, this liberality is necessary,
otherwise he would not be followed by soldiers. And of that which



176 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLl'S WORK

is neither yours nor your subjects' you can be a ready giver, as were
Cyrus, Caesar, and Alexander; because it does not take away your
reputation if you squander that of others, but adds to it; it is only
squandering your own that injures you.

And there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst
you exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become either poor
or despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated. And a
prince should guard himself, above all things, against being despised
and hated; and liberality leads you to both. Therefore it is wiser to
have a reputation for meanness which brings reproach without hatred,
than to be compelled through seeking a reputation for liberality to
incur a name for rapacity which begets reproach with hatred.

CHAPTER 1 7

Concerning cruelty and clemency, and whether
it Is better to be loved than feared.

Coming now to the other qualities mentioned above, I say that every
prince ought to desire to be considered clement and not cruel. Never
theless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency. Cesare
Borgia was considered cruel; notwithstanding, his cruelty reconciled
the Romagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty. And if
this be rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more
merciful than the Florentine people, who, to avoid a reputation for
cruelty, permitted Pistoia to be destroyed. Therefore a prince, so long
as he keeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the re
proach of cruelty; because with a few examples he will be more merciful
than those who, through too much mercy, allow disorders to arise,
from which follow murder or robbery; for these are wont to injure the
whole people, whilst those executions which originate with a prince
offend the individual only.

And of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the
imputation of cruelty, owing to new states being full of dangers. Hence
Virgil, through the mouth of Dido, excuses the inhumanity of her
reign owing to its being new, saying:

Res dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt
Moliri, et late fines custode tueri.

Nevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act, nor should he
himself show fear, but proceed in a temperate manner with prudence
and humanity, so that too much confidence may not make him in
cautious and too much distrust render him intolerable.

Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than
feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish
to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is

i , '
.4



THE PRINCE 177

much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be
dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that
they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowards, covetous, and as long as you
succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, prop
erty, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant;
but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who,
relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is
ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not
by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are
not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have
less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared,
for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the base
ness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but
fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.

Nevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he
does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well
being feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he
abstains from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their
women. But when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life of
some one, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause,
but above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others,
because men more quickly forget the death of their father than the
loss of their patrimony. Besides, pretexts for taking away the property
are never wanting; for he who has once begun to live by robbery will
always find pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons for
taking life, on the contrary, are more difficult to find and sooner lapse.
But when a prince is with his army, and has under control a multitude
of soldiers, then it is quite necessary for him to disregard the reputation
of cruelty, for without it he would never hold his army united or dis
posed to its duties.

Among the wonderful deeds of Hannibal this one is enumerated:
that having led an enormous army, composed of many various races
of men, to fight in foreign lands, no dissensions arose either among
them or against the prince, whether in his bad or in his good fortune.
This arose from nothing else than his inhuman cruelty, which, with
his boundless valour, made him revered and terrible in the sight of his
soldiers, but without that cruelty, his other virtues were not sufficient
to produce this effect. And short-sighted writers admire his deeds from
one point of view and from another condemn the principal cause of
them. That it is true his other virtues would not have been sufficient
for him may be proved by the case of Scipio, that most excellent man,
not only of his own times but within the memory of man, against whom,
nevertheless, his army rebelled in Spain; this arose from nothing but
his too great forbearance, which gave his soldiers more licence than is



178 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLI^ WORK

consistent with military discipline. For this he was upbraided in the
Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the corruptor of the Roman
soldiery. The Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio, yet they
were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate punished,
owing entirely to his easy nature. Insomuch that some one in the
Senate, wishing to excuse him, said there were many men who knew
much better how not to err than to correct the errors of others. This

disposition, if he had been continued in the command, would have
destroyed in time the fame and glory of Scipio; but, he being under
the control of the Senate, this injurious characteristic not only con
cealed itself, but contributed to his glory.

Returning to the question of being feared or loved, I come to the
conclusion that, men loving according to their own will and fearing ac
cording to that of the prince, a wise prince should establish himself on
that which is in his own control and not in that of others; he must
endeavour only to avoid hatred, as is noted.

CHAPTER 18

Concerning the way in which princes should keep faith.

Every one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and
to live with integrity and not with craft. Nevertheless our experience
has been that those princes who have done great things have held good
faith of little account, and have known how to circumvent the intellect
of men by craft, and in the end have overcome those who have relied
on their word. You must know there are two ways of contesting, the
one by the law, the other by force; the first method is proper to men,
the second to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient,
it is necessary to have recourse to the second. Therefore it is necessary
for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast and the
man. This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient writers,
who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were given
to the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his discipline;
which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who was half
beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know how to make
use of both natures, and that one without the other is not durable. A
prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought
to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot defend himself
against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves. There
fore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify
the wolves. Those who rely simply on the lion do not understand
what they are about. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor ought he to,
keep faith when such observance may be turned against him, and
when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer. If men



THE PRINCE 179

were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they are
bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to observe
it with them. Nor will there ever be wanting to a prince legitimate
reasons to excuse this non-observance. Of this endless modern ex

amples could be given, showing how many treaties and engagements
have been made void and of no effect through the faithlessness of
princes; and he who has known best how to employ the fox has suc
ceeded best.

But it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic,
and to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple,
and so subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will
always find some one who will allow himself to be deceived. One
recent example I cannot pass over in silence. Alexander the Sixth did
nothing else but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and
he always found victims; for there never was a man who had greater
power in asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing,
yet would observe it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded
according to his wishes, because he well understood this side of man
kind.

Therefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities
I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them.
And I shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to
observe them is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to
appear merciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but
with a mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may
be able and know how to change to the opposite.

And you have to understand this, that a prince, especially a new
one, cannot observe all those things for which men are esteemed, being
often forced, in order to maintain the state, to act contrary to fidelity,
friendship, humanity, and religion. Therefore it is necessary for him
to have a mind ready to turn itself accordingly as the winds and varia
tions of fortune force it, yet, as I have said above, not to diverge from
the good if he can avoid doing so, but, if compelled, then to know how
to set about it.

For this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets any
thing slip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five
qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether
merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious. There is nothing
more necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as
men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it
belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you.
Every one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are,
and those few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many,
who have the majesty of the state to defend them; and in the actions



180 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLI^ WORK

of all men, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to chal-
enge, one judges by the result.

For that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and hold
ing his state, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be
praised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a
thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are
only the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many
have no ground to rest on.

One prince of the present time, whom it is not well to name, never
preaches anything else but peace and good faith, and to both he is most
hostile, and either, if he had kept it, would have deprived him of
reputation and kingdom many a time.

CHAPTER 1 9

That one should avoid being despised and hated.

Now, concerning the characteristics of which mention is made above, I
have spoken of the more important ones, the others I wish to discuss
briefly under this generality, that the prince must consider, as has
been in part said before, how to avoid those things which will make
him hated or contemptible; and as often as he shall have succeeded he
will have fulfilled his part, and he need not fear any danger in other
reproaches.

It makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be rapacious,
and to be a violator of the property and women of his subjects, from
both of which he must abstain. And when neither their property nor

&gt;

honour is touched, the majority of men live content, and he has only
to contend with the ambition of a few, whom he can curb with ease in
many ways.

It makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous, ef
feminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a prince should
guard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in his
actions greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude; and in his private
dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments are irrevo
cable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can hope
either to deceive him or to get round him.

That prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of him
self, and he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for,
provided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by
his people, he can only be attacked with difficulty. For this reason a
prince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of his
subjects, the other from without, on account of external powers. From
the latter he is defended by being well armed and having good allies,
and if he is well armed he will have good friends, and affairs will always
remain quiet within when they are quiet without, unless they should



THE PRINCE 181

have been already disturbed by conspiracy; and even should affairs
outside be disturbed, if he has carried out his preparations and has
lived as I have said, as long as he does not despair, he will resist every
attack, as I said Nabis the Spartan did.

But concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he
has only to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which a prince can
easily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by
keeping the people satisfied with him, which it is most necessary for
him to accomplish, as I said above at length. And one of the most
efficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is not
to be hated and despised by the people, for he who conspires against a
prince always expects to please them by his removal; but when the con
spirator can only look forward to offending them, he will not have the
courage to take such a course, for the difficulties that confront a con
spirator are infinite. And as experience shows, many have been the
conspiracies, but few have been successful; because he who conspires
cannot act alone, nor can he take a companion except from those whom
he believes to be malcontents, and as soon as you have opened your
mind to a malcontent you have given him the material with which to
content himself, for by denouncing you he can look for every advan
tage; so that, seeing the gain from this course to be assured, and seeing
the other to be doubtful and full of dangers, he must be a very rare
friend, or a thoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince, to keep faith
with you.

And, to reduce the matter into a small compass, I say that, on the
side of the conspirator, there is nothing but fear, jealousy, prospect of
punishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is the
majesty of the principality, the laws, the protection of friends and the
state to defend him; so that, adding to all these things the popular
goodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as to conspire.
For whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before the execution
of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel to the crime; be
cause on account of it he has the people for an enemy, and thus cannot
hope for any escape.

Endless examples could be given on this subject, but I will be content
with one, brought to pass within the memory of our fathers. Messer
Annibale Bentivogli, who was prince in Bologna (grandfather of the
present Annibale), having been murdered by the Canneschi, who had
conspired against him, not one of his family survived but Messer
Giovanni, who was in childhood: immediately after his assassination
the people rose and murdered all the Canneschi. This sprung from the
popular goodwill which the house of Bentivogli enjoyed in those days
in Bologna; which was so great that, although none remained there after
the death of Annibale who were able to rule the state, the Bolognese,

w



182 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLI^ WORK

having information that there was one of the Bentivogli family in
Florence, who up to that time had been considered the son of a
blacksmith, sent to Florence for him and gave him the government of
their city, and it was ruled by him until Messer Giovanni came in due
course to the government.

For this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies
of little account when his people hold him in esteem; but when it is
hostile to him, and bears hatred towards him, he ought to fear every
thing and everybody. And well-ordered states and wise princes have
taken every care not to drive the nobles to desperation, and to keep
the people satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most important
objects a prince can have.

Among the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is
France, and in it are found many good institutions on which depend
the liberty and security of the king; of these the first is the parliament
and its authority, because he who founded the kingdom, knowing the
ambition of the nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit in
their mouths would be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other
side, knowing the hatred of the people, founded in fear, against the
nobles, he wished to protect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be
the particular care of the king; therefore, to take away the reproach
which he would be liable to from the nobles for favouring the people,
and from the people for favouring the nobles, he set up an arbiter, who
should be one who could beat down the great and favour the lesser
without reproach to the king. Neither could you have a better or a
more prudent arrangement, or a greater source of security to the king
and kingdom. From this one can draw another important conclusion,
that princes ought to leave affairs of reproach to the management of
others, and keep those of grace in their own hands. And further, I
consider that a prince ought to cherish the nobles, but not so as to
make himself hated by the people.

CHAPTER 22

Concerning the secretaries of princes.

The choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince, and they
are good or not according to the discrimination of the prince. And the
first opinion which one forms of a prince, and of his understanding, is
by observing the men he has around him; and when they are capable
and faithful he may always be considered wise, because he has known
how to recognise the capable and to keep them faithful. But when
they are otherwise one cannot form a good opinion of him, for the
prime error which he made was in choosing them.

There were none who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant
of Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, who would not consider Pan-



THE PRINCE 183

dolfo to be a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant. Because
there are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself;
another which appreciates what others comprehend; and a third which
neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first
is the most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless. Therefore,
it follows necessarily that, if Pandolfo was not in the first rank, he was
in the second, for whenever one has judgment to know good or bad
when it is said and done, although he himself may not have the initi
ative, yet he can recognise the good and the bad in his servant, and the
one he can praise and the other correct; thus the servant cannot hope
to deceive him, and is kept honest.

But to enable a prince to form an opinion of his servant there is one
test which never fails; when you see the servant thinking more of his
own interests than of yours, and seeking inwardly his own profit in
everything, such a man will never make a good servant, nor will you
ever be able to trust him; because he who has the state of another in
his hands ought never to think of himself, but always of his prince, and
never pay any attention to matters in which the prince is not concerned.

On the ether hand, to keep his servant honest the prince ought to
study him, honouring him, enriching him, doing him kindnesses, shar
ing with him the honours and cares; and at the same time let him see
that he cannot stand alone, so that many honours may not make him
desire more, many riches make him wish for more, and that many
cares may make him dread changes. When, therefore, servants, and
princes towards servants, are thus disposed, they can trust each other,
but when it is otherwise, the end will always be disastrous for either
one or the other.

CHAPTER 23

How flatterers should be avoided.

I do not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject, for it is
a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved, unless they
are very careful and discriminating. It is that of flatterers, of whom
courts are full, because men are so self-complacent in their own affairs,
and in a way so deceived in them, that they are preserved with diffi
culty from this pest, and if they wish to defend themselves they run the
danger of falling into contempt. Because there is no other way of
guarding oneself from flatterers except letting men understand that to
tell you the truth does not offend you; but when every one may tell
you the truth, respect for you abates.

Therefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing the
wise men in his state, and giving to them only the liberty of speaking
the truth to him, and then only of those things of which he inquires,
and of none others; but he ought to question them upon everything,



184 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLI^ WORK

and listen to their opinions, and afterwards form his own conclusions.
With these councillors, separately and collectively, he ought to carry
himself in such a way that each of them should know that, the more
freely he shall speak, the more he shall be preferred; outside of these,
he should listen to no one, pursue the thing resolved on, and be stead
fast in his resolutions. He who does otherwise is either overthrown by
flatterers, or is so often changed by varying opinions that he falls into
contempt.

I wish on this subject to adduce a modern example. Fra Luca, the
man of affairs to Maximilian, the present emperor, speaking of his
majesty, said: He consulted with no one, yet never got his own way
in anything. This arose because of his following a practice the opposite
to the above; for the emperor is a secretive manhe does not com
municate his designs to any one, nor does he receive opinions on them.
But as in carrying them into effect they become revealed and known,
they are at once obstructed by those men whom he has around him,
and he, being pliant, is diverted from them. Hence it follows that
those things he does one day he undoes the next, and no one ever under
stands what he wishes or intends to do, and no one can rely on his
resolutions.

A prince, therefore, ought always to take counsel, but only when he
wishes and not when others wish; he ought rather to discourage every
one from offering advice unless he asks it; but, however, he ought to be
a constant inquirer, and afterwards a patient listener concerning the
things of which he inquired; also, on learning that any one, on any
consideration, has not told him the truth, he should let his anger be felt.

And if there are some who think that a prince who conveys an im
pression of his wisdom is not so through his own ability, but through the
good advisers that he has around him, beyond doubt they are deceived,
because this is an axiom which never fails: that a prince who is not
wise himself will never take good advice, unless by chance he has
yielded his affairs entirely to one person who happens to be a very
prudent man. In this case indeed he may be well governed, but it
would not be for long, because such a governor would in a short time
take away his state from him.

But if a prince who is not experienced should take counsel from more
than one he will never get united counsels, nor will he know how to
unite them. Each of the counsellors will think of his own interests, and
the prince will not know how to control them or to see through them.
And they are not to be found otherwise, because men will always prove
untrue to you unless they are kept honest by constraint. Therefore it
must be inferred that good counsels, whencesoever they come, are born
of the wisdom of the prince, and not the wisdom of the prince from
good counsels.



THE PRINCE 185

CHAPTER 24

Why the princes of Italy have lost their states.
The previous suggestions, carefully observed, will enable a new prince
to appear well established, and render him at once more secure and
fixed in the state than if he had been long seated there. For the actions
of a new prince are more narrowly observed than those of an hereditary
one, and when they are seen to be able they gain more men and bind
far tighter than ancient blood; because men are attracted more by the
present than by the past, and when they find the present good they
enjoy it and seek no further; they will also make the utmost defence
for a prince if he fails them not in other things. Thus it will be a double
glory to him to have established a new principality, and adorned and
strengthened it with good laws, good arms, good allies, and with a good
example; so will it be a double disgrace to him who, born a prince,
shall lose his state by want of wisdom.

And if those seigniors are considered who have lost their states in
Italy in our times, such as the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and
others, there will be found in them, firstly, one common defect in
regard to arms from the causes which have been discussed at length; in
the next place, some one of them will be seen, either to have had the
people hostile, or if he has had the people friendly, he has not known
how to secure the nobles. In the absence of these defects states that
have power enough to keep an army in the field cannot be lost.

Philip of Macedn, not the father of Alexander the Great, but he
who was conquered by Titus Quintius, had not much territory com
pared to the greatness of the Romans and of Greece who attacked him,

4

yet being a warlike man who knew how to attract the people and secure
the nobles, he sustained the war against his enemies for many years,
and if in the end he lost the dominion of some cities, nevertheless he
retained the kingdom.

Therefore, do not let our princes accuse fortune for the loss of their
principalities after so many years' possession, but rather their own
sloth, because in quiet times they never thought there could be a
change (it is a common defect in man not to make any provision in the
calm against the tempest), and when afterwards the bad times came
they thought of flight and not of defending themselves, and they hoped
that the people, disgusted with the insolence of the conquerors, would
recall them. This course, when others fail, may be good, but it is very
bad to have neglected all other expedients for that, since you would
never wish to fall because you trusted to be able to find some one later
on to restore you. This again either does not happen, or, if it does, it
will not be for your security, because that deliverance is of no avail
which does not depend upon yourself; those only are reliable, certain,
and durable that depend on yourself and your valour.

CHAPTER 25

What fortune can effect in human affairs, and
how to withstand her.

It is not unknown to me how many men have had, and still have, the
opinion that the affairs of the world are in such wise governed by for
tune and by God that men with their wisdom cannot direct them and
that no one can even help them; and because of this they would have
us believe that it is not necessary to labour much in affairs, but to let
chance govern them. This opinion has been more credited in our times
because of the great changes in affairs which have been seen, and may
still be seen, every day, beyond all human conjecture. Sometimes
pondering over this, I am in some degree inclined to their opinion.
Nevertheless, not to extinguish our free will, I hold it to be true that
fortune is the arbiter of one half of our actions, but that she still leaves
us to direct the other half, or perhaps a little less.

I compare her to one of those raging rivers, which when in flood
overflows the plains, sweeping away trees and buildings, bearing away
the soil from place to place; everything flies before it, all yield to its
violence, without being able in any way to withstand it; and yet,
though its nature be such, it does not follow therefore that men, when
the weather becomes fair, shall not make provision, both with defences
and barriers, in such a manner that, rising again, the waters may pass
away by canal, and their force be neither so unrestrained nor so danger
ous. So it happens with fortune, who shows her power where valour
has not prepared to resist her, and thither she turns her forces where
she knows that barriers and defences have not been raised to constrain
her.

And if you will consider Italy, which is the seat of these changes,
and which has given to them their impulse, you will see it to be an open
country without barriers and without any deferce. For if it had been
defended by proper valour, as are Germany, Spain, and France, either
this invasion would not have made the great changes it has made or it
would not have come at all. And this I consider enough to say con
cerning resistance to fortune in general.

But confining myself more to the particular, I say that a prince may
be seen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown
any change of disposition or character. This, I believe, arises firstly
from causes that have already been discussed at length, namely, that
the prince who relies entirely upon fortune is lost when it changes.
I believe also that he will be successful who directs his actions according
to the spirit of the times, and that he whose actions do not accord with
the times will not be successful. Because men are seen, in affairs that
lead to the end which every man has before him, namely, glory and
riches, to get there by various methods; one with caution, another



THE PRINCE 187

with haste; one by force, another by skill; one by patience, another by
its opposite; and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by a different
method. One can also see of two cautious men the one attain his end,
the other fail; and similarly, two men by different observances are
equally successful, the one being cautious, the other impetuous; all this
arises from nothing else than whether or not they conform in their
methods to the spirit of the times. This follows from what I have said,
that two men working differently bring about the same effect, and of
two working similarly, one attains his object and the other does not.

Changes in estate also issue from this, for if, to one who governs him
self with caution and patience, times and affairs converge in such a
way that his administration is successful, his fortune is made; but if
times and affairs change, he is ruined if he does not change his course
of action. But a man is not often found sufficiently circumspect to
know how to accommodate himself to the change, both because he
cannot deviate from what nature inclines him to, and also because,
having always prospered by acting in one way, he cannot be persuaded
that it is well to leave it; and, therefore, the cautious man, when it is
time to turn adventurous, does not know how to do it, hence he is
ruined; but had he changed his conduct with the times fortune would
not have changed.

Pope Julius the Second went to work impetuously in all his affairs,
and found the times and circumstances conform so well to that line of
action that he always met with success. Consider his first enterprise
against Bologna, Messer Giovanni Bentivogli being still alive: The
Venetians were not agreeable to it, nor was the King of Spain, and he
had the enterprise still under discussion with the King of France:
nevertheless he personally entered upon the expedition with his ac
customed boldness and energy, a move which made Spain and the
Venetians stand irresolute and passive, the latter from fear, the former
from desire to recover all the kingdom of Naples; on the other hand, he
drew after him the King of France, because that king, having observed
the movement, and desiring to make the Pope his friend so as to humble
the Venetians, found it impossible to refuse him soldiers without mani
festly offending him. Therefore Julius with his impetuous action ac
complished what no other pontiff with simple human wisdom could
have done ; for if he had waited in Rome until he could get away, with
his plans arranged and everything fixed, as any other pontiff would
have done, he would never have succeeded. Because the King of France
would have made a thousand excuses, and the others would have
raised a thousand fears.

I will leave his other actions alone, as they were all alike, and they
all succeeded, for the shortness of his life did not let him experience
the contrary; but if circumstances had arisen which required him to



188 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLI's WORK

go cautiously, his ruin would have followed, because he would never
have deviated from those ways to which nature inclined him.

I conclude therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind
steadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement men are
successful, but unsuccessful when they fall out. For my part I consider
that it is better to be adventurous than cautious, because fortune is a
woman, and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and
ill-use her; and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by the
adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly. She is,
therefore, always, woman-like, a lover of young men, because they are
less cautious, more violent, and with more audacity command her.

CHAPTER 26

An exhortation to liberate Italy from the barbarians.

Having carefully considered the subject of the above discourses, and
wondering within myself whether the present times were propitious to a
new prince, and whether there were the elements that would give an
opportunity to a wise and virtuous one to introduce a new order of
things which would do honour to him and good to the people of this
country, it appears to me that so many things concur to favour a new
prince that I never knew a time more fit than the present.

And if, as I said, it was necessary that the people of Israel should be
captive so as to make manifest the ability of Moses; that the Persians
should be oppressed by the Medes so as to discover the greatness of the
soul of Cyrus; and that the Athenians should be dispersed to illustrate
the capabilities of Theseus: then at the present time, in order to dis
cover the virtue of an Italian spirit, it was necessary that Italy should
be reduced to the extremity she is now in, that she should be more
enslaved than the Hebrews, more oppressed than the Persians, more
scattered than the Athenians; without head, without order, beaten,
despoiled, torn, overrun; and to have endured every kind of desolation.

Although lately some spark may have been shown by one, which
made us think he was ordained by God for our redemption, neverthe
less it was afterwards seen, in the height of his career, that fortune
rejected him; so that Italy, left as without life, waits for him who shall
yet heal her wounds and put an end to the ravaging and plundering of
Lombardy, to the swindling and taxing of the Kingdom and of Tus
cany, and cleanse those sores that for long have festered. It is seen how
she entreats God to send some one who shall deliver her from these

wrongs and barbarous insolencies. It is seen also that she is ready and
willing to follow a banner if only some one will raise it.

Nor is there to be seen at present one in whom she can place more
hope than in your illustrious house, with its valour and fortune, favoured
by God and by the Church of which it is now the chief, and which could
be made the head of this redemption. This will not be difficult if you



THE PRINCE 189

will recall to yourself the actions and lives of the men I have named.
And although they were great and wonderful men, yet they were men,
and each one of them had no more opportunity than the present offers,
for their enterprises were neither more just nor easier than this, nor
was God more their friend than He is yours.

With us there is great justice, because that war is just which is
necessary, and arms are hallowed when there is no other hope but in
them. Here there is the greatest willingness, and where the willingness
is great the difficulties cannot be great if you will only follow those
men to whom I have directed your attention. Further than this, how
extraordinarily the ways of God have been manifested beyond ex
ample: the sea is divided, a cloud has led the way, the rock has poured
forth water, it has rained manna, everything has contributed to your
greatness; you ought to do the rest. God is not willing to do everything,
and thus take away our free will and that share of glory which belongs
to us.

And it is not to be wondered at if none of the above-named Italians
have been able to accomplish all that is expected from your illustrious
house; and if in so many revolutions in Italy, and in so many campaigns,
it has always appeared as if military virtue were exhausted, this has
happened because the old order of things was not good, and none of us
have known how to find a new one. And nothing honours a man more
than to establish new laws and new ordinances when he himself has

newly risen. Such things when they are well founded and dignified
will make him revered and admired, and in Italy there are not wanting
opportunities to bring such into use in every form.

Here there is great valour in the limbs whilst it fails in the head.
Look attentively at the duels and the hand-to-hand combats, how
superior the Italians are in strength, dexterity, and subtlety. But when
it comes to armies they do not bear comparison, and this springs
entirely from the insufficiency of the leaders, since those who are
capable are not obedient, and each one seems to himself to know, there
having never been any one so distinguished above the rest, either by
valour or fortune, that others would yield to him. Hence it is that for
so long a time, and during so much fighting in the past twenty years,
whenever there has been an army wholly Italian, it has always given a
poor account of itself; the first witness to this is II Taro, afterwards
Alexandria, Capua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, Mestri.

If, therefore, your illustrious house wishes to follow those remarkable
men who have redeemed their country, it is necessary before all things,
as a true foundation for every enterprise, to be provided with your own
forces, because there can be no more faithful, truer, or better soldiers.
And although singly they are good, altogether they will be much better
when they find themselves commanded by their prince, honoured by
him, and maintained at his expense. Therefore it is necessary to be



190 SELECTIONS FROM MACHIAVELLI^ WORK

prepared with such arms, so that you can be defended against foreigners
by Italian valour.

And although Swiss and Spanish infantry may be considered very
formidable, nevertheless there is a defect in both, by reason of which
a third order would not only be able to oppose them, but might be
relied upon to overthrow them. For the Spaniards cannot resist
cavalry, and the Switzers are afraid of infantry whenever they en
counter them in close combat. Owing to this, as has been and may
again be seen, the Spaniards are unable to resist French cavalry, and
the Switzers are overthrown by Spanish infantry. And although a com
plete proof of this latter cannot be shown, nevertheless there was some
evidence of it at the battle of Ravenna, when the Spanish infantry were
confronted by German battalions, who follow the same tactics as the
Swiss; when the Spaniards, by agility of body and with the aid of their
shields, got in under the pikes of the Germans and stood out of danger,
able to attack, while the Germans stood helpless, and, if the cavalry had
not dashed up, all would have been over with them. It is possible, there
fore, knowing the defects of both these infantries, to invent a new one,
which will resist cavalry and not be afraid of infantry; this need not
create a new order of arms, but a variation upon the old. And these
are the kind of improvements which confer reputation and power upon
a new prince.

This opportunity, therefore, ought not to be allowed to pass for
letting Italy at last see her liberator appear. Nor can one express the
love with which he would be received in all those provinces which

To be sure, the ideological framework of the Divine Comedy explains
neither its origination nor its beauty, but it is there, and it alone enables
us to understand the poem's contents. Virgil holds sway in Limbo over
the poets and Aristotle over the philosophers, but Boniface VIII has a
place all prepared for him in Hell, while Manfred, who died excom
municate, waits patiently in Purgatory for his daughter's prayers to
shorten the years that still stand between him and the sight of God. The
fact is, as Villani said, that this Manfred was "an enemy of Holy Church,
of clerics and of monks, seizing the churches as his father did before
him". His crimes and those of Boniface VIII have no common mea
sure: the one relieved the Church of possessions to which it had no right,
and so he could be exonerated; but the other had attempted to violate
the majesty of the Empire: hence it was impossible to save him. The
same laws of the same Dantesque universe explain Siger's proximity to
Thomas Aquinas, or rather they demand it, since Dante's allocation of
authority makes it necessary. Everything encourages us to attribute to
him the fundamental convictions that we have mentioned, for they are
the convictions that animate the whole of his work. The Convivio having
restored in its entirety the moral authority of the Philosopher over the
Emperor, the Monarchy having restored in its entirety the political
authority of the Emperor over the Popes, the Divine Comedy provides a
fresh reminder of the rights and duties of all, but here Dante is no longer
content, as in his previous works, with founding them in law on the
absolute notion of divine justice; by the magic of his art he actually

shows the movements of this Justicethe eternal custodian of the laws
of the world, which it preserves in the form in which it created it. For
it is certainly this Justice that beatifies the just with its love, as it crushes
the unjust beneath its wrath. If it is only too true that in the poem it
does not always seem to us equitable in its judgments the reason is that
this divine Justice is, after all, merely Dante's conception of justice, but
we are concerned rather with understanding the work and its author
than with judging them.

If the essence of these conclusions should by right be regarded as
true, Dante's general attitude towards philosophy would be less that
of a philosopher anxious to cultivate it for its own sake than that of a
judge desirous of rendering it its due, so as to obtain from it the contri
bution which ethics and politics are entitled to expect it to make to the
great cause of temporal human happiness. Here, therefore, as in all his
speculative work, Dante adopts the attitude of a defender of the public
weal. His special function is not to promote philosophy, nor to teach
theology, nor to demonstrate the working of the Empire, but to inspire
these fundamental authorities once more with the mutual respect which
their divine origin exacts from them. Whenever any one of them, out
of greed, exceeds the limits imposed by God on its domain, it enters a
state of revolt against an authority no less sacred than itself, an author
ity whose jurisdiction it usurps. This is the commonest and most per
nicious crime committed against justice, which is the most human and
the best loved of the virtues, even as injustice in all its formstreason,
ingratitude, treachery, theft, fraud and peculationis the most in
human and the most hateful.

Understood in this sense, the virtue ofJustice signifies in Dante above
all fidelity to the great authorities whose divine origin renders them
sacred, injustice, on the contrary, consisting in every sort of betrayal of
these authorities, which he himself never mentioned save in tones of
submission: philosophy and its Philosopher, the Empire and its Em
peror, the Church and its Pope. When he attacksand how harshly
he does so!one of the representatives of these cardinal authorities,
his sole object is to shield one of them against what he regards as a trans
gression on the part of its human representative. The savage freedom
of his invective against the leaders springs from his love for the great
spiritual realities which he accuses them of undermining through fail
ure to respect their limits, since each of these realities destroys itself
by usurping the power of another no less than it destroys that power
by usurping it. We may certainly argue about the actual idea that
Dante formed of these dominant authorities and of their respective
spheres of influence, but once this idea has been accepted we are no
longer justified in mistaking the nature of the feeling by which he was
actuated. Those who accuse him of pride misinterpret his outbursts of



194 MODERN COMMENTARY ON DANTE

1

invective, for his violence is indicative of a passionate submission that "
/

demands of others a like willingness to submit. His verdict descends on
the adversary not from a pinnacle of self-aggrandisement, but from that
pinnacle to which he raises his three great ideals. We offend him only
if we offend them. The torment of this great spirit was to be ceaselessly
in conflict with what he loved most in the world in consequence of his
very longing to serve it; his enemies were Popes who betray the Church
and Emperors who betray the Empire. It is in response to this stimulus
that Dante's invective is unleashed to smite traitors, for in this universe
in which the gravest of evils is injustice, the gravest injustice is treach
ery, and the gravest treachery of all is not betrayal of a benefactor,
but betrayal of a leader. Every betrayal of this kind shakes the fabric
of the world in that it shakes the authorities on which God Himself wills
that it should be founded and which, together with order, ensure its
unity and peace. The foulest denizen of the depths of Dante's hell is
Lucifer, who has betrayed his Maker, and the three arch-criminals
whose eternal chastisement Lucifer ensures are also the arch-traitors:

Judas Iscariot, the betrayer of God, and Cassius and Brutus, the betray
ers of Caesar. How can we mistake the implications of this terrible
symbolism? It is most certainly a greater crime to betray the majesty
of God than to betray the majesty of the Emperor, but it is the same
class of offence, and in either case it is the crime of crimes: the betrayal
of majesty.

In thus making sure what it is that Dante despises more than any
thing else in the world, we learn what he esteems above all things:
loyalty to the powers established by God. This has been too often for
gotten by expositors of his works, especially when their philosophical,
theological and political content has been involved. It is idle to attempt
to identify the single master whose disciple he is supposed to have been.
Dante cannot be regarded as having less than three simultaneously. In
fact, in a given sphere, he submits always to the supreme authority in
that sphere: to Virgil in poetry, to Ptolemy in astronomy, to Aristotle
in philosophy, to St. Dominic in speculative theology, to St. Francis in
affective theology and to St. Bernard in mystical theology. Many others
could be found answering to the description of guides. It matters little
to him who the man is, provided that in every case he is sure of follow
ing the greatest. Such is the chosen system to which the only truly
authentic Dante seems always to have adhered. If, as is asserted, a
"unifying vision" of his work exists, it cannot be identified with any
philosophy, or with a political cause, or even with a theology. We shall
find it rather in his peculiarly personal conception of the virtue of
justice and of the allegiances which that virtue exacts. Dante's work
does not constitute a system, but is the dialectical and lyrical expression
of all his loyalties.

Thus the hierarchies of being, truth, beauty, perfection, indeed of all
value, are reduced to a hierarchy of light ascending to the very Primal
Light itself, spiritual, uncreated, divine, the vision of which is the vision
of all. The doctrines we have considered are the bare bones of the most

important part of Dante's universe. The flesh and substance are the
Paradiso, to which we now turn.

While the Inferno and Purgatorio, in their respective ways, are con
cerned with the correction of moral error, the Paradiso as a journey
through the intelligible universe celebrates truth and involves the cor
rection of intellectual error. Here Dante rectifies his mistakes of thought
and knowledge on such questions as the ordering of the celestial hier
archy, the origin of the spots on the moon, and the language of Adam.
The Paradiso is thus philosophical poetry, both in the obvious meaning
and in the most exact sense of this term. It solves the problem of render
ing a systematically ordered world of pure thought in terms of images.
To the extent that the Inferno and Purgatorio deal with virtue, they bear
on the ethical realm and are dramatic and psychological. Readers of
the Paradiso are sometimes disappointed because it lacks those dramatic
qualities which dominate the previous cantiche and which, we generally
assume, are central to literature.

For Dante, however, the ethical realm and the life of conflict and
choice prepare the way for a life of ideal emotional and intellectual
activities. The ultimate objects of desire are not actions but states of
mind and spiritunderstanding, love, joy. The Paradiso, so to speak,
evokes "a life beyond life," pure spontaneity which transcends morality
and the ordinary forms of human experience. Hence comes its lyrical
and evocative character, the subjective mode in which Dante describes
this part of the universe. He is, in a way, the single character here, the
only one still capable of surprise. What we feel about his experience
at this stage of the journey we feel through the effect his various experi
ences have on him.

If the problem of the Paradiso was the reduction of objects of thought
to objects of vision, how was this accomplished? First, the ladder of
light constituted an ontological principle which ran through the whole
of reality, from the sensible to the intelligible to God. Light meta
physics also unified and made continuous these two orders of reality,
by positing light, in its various analogical forms, as the single strand
running through the whole universe. To the various forms of light

196 MODERN COMMENTARY ON DANTE

corresponded various forms of apperception, both sense and thought
being explained by the union of "inner and outer lights." There was
thus no truly sharp cleavage in light metaphysicsat least for the
imaginationbetween the realms of matter and spirit, sense and
thought. Thought was not a world of pure colorless concepts, but one of
even brighter light than the world of senses. Thus the intelligible world
was supersensuous both in a privative and in a positive sense. Clearly,
the solution to Dante's problem lay at hand in the concepts and images
of the light-metaphysics tradition. He could shape the ladder of light
the ultimate principle of all value in the universeto render his own
universal vision in terms of shapes, grades, and kinds of light.

The second mode of rendering the celestial universe was to make the
heavenly host manifest itself in space and time during the journey
through the spheres. The Paradiso's imagery thus functions as symbol
ism since it refers to a higher reality than language can formulate.
Dante's images, however, far from being arbitrary are drawn from the
world of knowledge and observation; they mean what they say and
simultaneously point to a reality which transcends them. Dante shapes
light to build the universe of the Paradiso, but this light has the same
properties and obeys the same laws as the light of the universe accord
ing to the knowledge of his time. His universe is thus simultaneously
an imaginative creation and a world about which one might ask the
same questions as one asks about the real world.

The eyes whose function it is to be lured by beauty discern it through
its garment of light, the latter a reflection or incarnation of the imma
terial, uncreated light that is God. Luminosity in matter is simply a
defective manifestation of the same power as it exists detached from
matter. Thus in canto a ray of immaterial light from the immaterial
tenth heaven or Empyrean materializes itself at a point in the concave
surface of the ninth sphere "which derives from this ray light and
power." At this point time and space begin, as well as causality and
natural law, for in the Empyrean "where God rules directly, natural
law is of no effect." This light is the "lume" or "splendor of God" ....
This power communicates existence and activity to the entire universe
through the agency of the primum mobile, which, spinning within the
Empyrean, transmits its virt to all the lower spheres that it encloses
and through them to all other beings .... Thus the unitary power
and efficacy of the heaven of light are diffracted through the stars and
planets, constituting a graded ladder of light as causal power. . . .

Clearly, light is here a function and correlate of love and therefore
functions as beautyindeed, it is the principle of beauty itself. The
circular operation of the triad light-love-vision, or beauty-love-knowl-
edge, is made clearer by St. Peter Damian. A divine light centers upon
him, penetrating the light of which he is made. Its power, joined to



JOSEPH A. MAZZEO 197

his sight, so uplifts him that he is able to see the divine essence from
which it comes. This light produces the joy with which he is aflame;
the clearness of the flame matches the clarity of his sight.... The
union of the "inner" lights of the faculties of apprehension with the
"outer lights" constituting reality releases joy (delectatio), in the tradi
tion of light metaphysicsa special application of the general scholas
tic principle that joy attends the union of a thing with that which befits
it (coniunctio convenientis cum convenienti). Thus the wisest of men and the
great contemplative expound a complementary doctrine. Increase of
vision-knowledge results in an increase of love which in turn demands
more and higher light. This circular process is characteristic of the
ascent from heaven to heaven and ends only when the infinite eternal
Light is reached.

The circularity of vision-love-light is adumbrated early . . . when
Dante asks Beatrice whether unfulfilled vows can be compensated for
by other means besides fulfillment, such as good works. Before answer
ing, she increases in luminous beauty, a beauty which overpowers him.
At the very start of canto 5 she explains her beauty, which blinded him,
as a function of love and vision or truth. It is the flame of love, an "ex
terior light" which derives from the perfect and immediate vision of the
Eternal Light, a vision which kindles love or, more precisely, is an
amorous vision. Beatrice observes that she can already see in Dante's
mind the implied "interior light," a shining of the eternal light of truth.

Dante here explains the activity of the beatified consciousness partly
in terms of his own, partly in terms of Beatrice's, but (witness the souls
of Solomon and Peter Damian) the process also takes place in each
consciousness separately. Beatrice in effect tells us that Dante now
shares more fully in the eternal light and is thus prepared for the recep
tion of the truth she is about to divulge. As Nardi demonstrated,
Dante's epistemology is Augustinian and posits some form of divine
illumination as the actualizing principle in the process of knowledge.
Beatrice concludes by explaining that the eternal light of truth is the
true object of love and that any other becomes such only because the
Eternal Light shines through it in its beauty. . . .

Happiness also manifests itself as light, and the brightness of a soul
grows with increase of joy. Beatrice shines with greater splendor when
she sees the Eternal Light of truth shining in Dante's mind ... ; Justin
ian glows with joy when ready to impart a new truth to Dante .... As
Beatrice's joy rises while she leads Dante closer and closer to ultimate
reality, her beauty and luminosity increase with each ascent. But light
here as everywhere in the Paradiso is no simple external sign of an inner
state but is functional as the principle of truth, beauty, and being.

This circularity is, then, both a convenient metaphor and a struc
tural rhythm permeating the Paradiso, at once the pattern of expanding



198 MODERN COMMENTARY ON DANTE

consciousness and of ascent through the intelligible universe. The
expanding spiral of growing awareness has a triadic structure, being
constituted of moments of increasing light-beauty, followed by growth
of love and knowledge and of a fresh desire which demands greater
beauty. Each ascent is accompanied by an increase in knowledge and
so leads toward God through the intelligible universe. We journey
simultaneously through the ladder of love, the scale of being, and the
hierarchy of all value rendered as light.

The virtuous triadic circularity of the Paradiso describes the way in
which consciousness extends its range both qualitatively and quanti
tatively. It describes the progress of consciousness as the development
of perception already known and as the successive introduction of new
dimensions of insight not derivable from the preceding state. Each mo
ment of Dante's "blindness" as he ascends from sphere to sphere is
really the moment of superrational ecstasy which precedes conscious
awareness of a new and higher level of reality; this sort of "blindness"
comes from an excess of light.

But the Paradiso actually has a linear as well as a circular rhythm:
these correspond to two simultaneous journeys, one through the sensi
ble, the other through the intelligible, world. As the spirits of the
blessed only manifest themselves in the universe of space and time but
reside in the Empyrean, so the architecture of the intelligible universe
is gradually revealed through its sensible analogue. Finally, with the
acquisition of a new sense of vision, once the limits of the universe of
space and time have been passed, all reality is simultaneously grasped
in one flash. Dante's linear ascent frequently comes to life through the
imagery of wings and of the arrow seeking its mark. It is interrupted as
Dante, upon entering each sphere, is carried along for a time by its
diurnal motion. Circularitya "motion" proper to spiritual and in
corruptible substancesmanifests itself in the moment of transition
from sphere to sphere primarily in Dante the pilgrim's consciousness
and, upon completion of the journey, as the "motion" of his desire and
will after they are "revolved by the Love that moves the sun and the
other stars". . . .

The state of blessedness, in the very presence of God, is not identical
with the activity of consciousness on the road to God. It is rather the
activity at the journey's term. This state begins with grace which
rectifies and makes good the will. A good will and grace constitute
merit which determines the degree of vision or "sight" of God's essence.
This sight, in its own right, awakens love. . . . The circularity which
Solomon and Peter Damian describe, also ultimately a gift of grace,
may be said to have a fourth phase as the presupposition of its triadic
movement. However, the state, as distinct from the attainment of



JOSEPH A. MAZZEO 19

blessedness ends with the love which follows vision, for the angels and
the blessed are completely filled with beatitude, and their vision is as
complete as it can be. In the process of ascent, the emphasis is placed
on love's demand for more light as beauty and knowledge, since vision
is not yet complete and love must therefore demand and obtain more of
the light which is beauty ....

This light is a reflection of the infinite, eternal light. It is divine
goodness which reveals its beauty through its burning and sparkling . . .
and the Primal Light irradiating the angels and eliciting their love ....
Every lesser good is as a light from its ray, and more than any other it
moves the mind to love .... It operates through all the lesser lights
and beauties of creation, including Beatrice.

Beatrice's blinding supernatural beauty is but the light in which,
like Peter Damian and the other saints, she is "embosomed," the light
of which she is now made. Now that Beatrice has put off the corruptible
body, that inner splendor shines in all its power. The incorruptible
body she, along with Solomon and the other saints, will put on after the
resurrection will be even more beautiful because it will have still more
vision and its inner flame of love will shine yet brighter.

From the two sources of light, material and immaterial, there radiate
being, actuality, excellence, blessedness, and the luminosity which is
beauty itself. All, pari passu, constitute various hierarchical orders and
are reducible to properties of the analogical forms of light. The ladders
of light, being, love, knowledge, and beauty are all actually fused; this
fusion permits Dante to ascend to God as poet, lover, philosopher, and
mystic seer all at once. For each step in the ladder includes and tran
scends the qualities and perfections of the one below it until Perfection
and Reality themselves are reached and found to be a "simple light,"
from whose virtuous radiation the entire universe is ultimately derived.
The ladder of light and beauty is thus, in one way, the scala Dei par
excellence, for if all the distinctions in reality are traceable to light, so
Dante's distinctions in forms and modes of apprehension and appetition
are reduced to a kind of sui generis unitary faculty which transcends and
unifies sense and thought, love and knowledge, and is the faculty for
perceiving this supersensuous immaterial light. Paradise contains no
object of thought which is not at the same time an object of "sense,"
no object of love which is not fully an object of knowledge. To light, as
the principle of All, corresponds this faculty as power of simultaneously
grasping all (totum simul).

The light that is beauty motivates the ascent to "simple light" by
engendering the desire which drives the soul to God. The light is ulti
mately the radiated light {lume) of God, His grace .... But light as
motive power resides mediately in Beatrice's beautiful eyes which have



200 MODERN COMMENTARY ON DANTE

lifted Dante from planet to planet through the heavens .... The
beauty of her eyes comes into play especially as the poet mounts from
sphere to sphere. The surge from the earthly paradise to the heavens
begins when Beatrice fixes her eyes on the heavens and Dante fixes his
own upon hers. They had previously both been looking at the sun to
gether, she first and he imitating her.

Dante, in his reconstituted unfallen nature, can bear to contemplate
the sun in all its splendor, along with Beatrice. Suddenly the sky is
doubly bright, as if two suns were shining in it; Dante then fixes his
eyes on Beatrice's; she, in turn, is looking heavenward .... Her aspect
transforms, divinizes him, an indescribable experience the nature of
which he suggests only by analogy with the story of Glaucus and allusion
to St. Paul's experience .... Only after gazing on her eyes is he trans-
humanized and he hears the music of the spheres. Simultaneously he
sees a further increase in light which arouses his desire to know the cause
of his experience ....

The pattern here described repeats itself at every stage of the journey
through the spheres: Beatrice looks toward a higher reality, Dante gazes
into her eyes and, as light increases, reaches another sphere. At first
she has to tell him that he is ascending; later, from any increase of light
he gathers that he has reached a higher sphere. Such an increase of
light is always accompanied by a growing desire or love and by a
change in the "spiritual gravity" or natural love of the soul, which, free
from sin, shoots off like a bolt of lightning toward its natural place. In
the explanation which follows, Beatrice describes the doctrine of the
pondus amoris, the internal principle of all things, corporeal and intellec
tual, prompting them to seek their proper place, moving to different
ports over the great sea of being, each with a guiding instinct of its
own .... As Glaucus became a sea-god, Dante, extending the image,
intimates that he has become a god in the sea of being. Beatrice con
cludes by explaining that his natural motion upward is no miracle. It
is as natural for him to rise as it is for fire to ascend to its sphere ....

The process of ascent is thus a version of the same virtuous circularity
of Peter Damian's and Solomon's light-love-vision. Dante "sinks" him
self in Beatrice's eyes which themselves are "sunk" in the vision of the
Eternal Light. An increase of light is accompanied by an increase of
love, which in turn demands more light. To clarify this process, let us
examine the various moments of transition from star to star.

In ascending to the moon, Dante simply describes some aspects of the
process later stated more emphatically. He fixes his eyes on Beatrice's
and in an instant is carried to the lunar sphere by the "inborn and
perpetual thirst for the godlike kingdom." He recalls her happiness
and beauty and describes his entry into the body of the moon, still un
certain whether he is in his body. Weighing the possibility of the



miraculous interpenetration of bodies, he likens the physical process of
ascent to a ray of light passing through water without breaking it. The
light of this sphere calls to mind a pearl and a diamond sparkling in
the sun ....

Without passing beyond the sphere of learned criticism, I think we may
say this: the various interpretations, in this matter, are not mutually
exclusive. Symbolism and literalness, in Dante's time, and in his prac
tice, are simultaneous. For instance, in any history of mediaeval phi
losophy you may read that a great subject of dispute in those days was
the question whether universal terms or natures, such as man, or hu
manity, existed before the particulars, in the particulars, or after the
particulars, by abstraction of what was common to them all. Now,
this matter was undoubtedly much disputed about; but there is one
comprehensive and orthodox solution, which represents the true mind
of the age, above the peculiar hobbies or heresies of individuals. This
solution is that universal terms or natures exist before the particulars,
and in the particulars, and after the particulars: for God, before he made
the world, knew how he intended to make it, and had eternally in his
mind the notions of a perfect man, horse, etc., after which the particu
lars were to be modelled, or to which, in case of accident, they were to
be restored, either by the healing and recuperative force of nature, or by
the ministrations of grace. But universal terms or natures existed also
in the particulars, since the particulars illustrated them, shared in
them, and were what they were by virtue of that participation. Never
theless, the universals existed also after the particulars: for the discursive
mind of man, surveying the variety of natural things, could not help
noticing and abstracting the common types that often recur in them;
and this ex post facto idea, in the human mind, is a universal term also.
To deny any of the three theories, and not to see their consistency, is to
miss the mediaeval point of view, which, in every sense of the word, was
Catholic.

Just such a solution seems to me natural in the case of Beatrice. We
have it on independent documentary evidence that in Dante's time
there actually lived in Florence a certain Bice Portinari; and there are
many incidents in the Vita Nuova and in the Commedia which hardly
admit of an allegorical interpretation; such as the death of Beatrice,
and especially that of her father, on which occasion Dante writes a

202 MODERN COMMENTARY ON DANTE

sympathetic poem. I can see no reason why this lady, as easily as any
other person, should not have called forth the dreamful passion of our
poet. That he had loved some one is certain. Most people have; and
why should Dante, in particular, have found the language of love a
natural veil for his philosophy, if the passion and the language of love
had not been his mother-tongue? The language of love is no doubt
usual in the allegories of mystics, and was current in the conventional
poetry of Dante's time; but mystics themselves are commonly crossed
or potential lovers; and the troubadours harped on the string of love
simply because it was the most responsive string in their own natures,
and that which could most easily be made to vibrate in their hearers.
Dante was not less sensitive than the average man of his generation; and
if he followed the fashion of minstrels and mystics, it was because he
shared their disposition. The beautiful, the unapproachable, the divine,
had passed before him in some visible form; it matters nothing whether
this vision came once only, and in the shape of the actual Beatrice, or
continuously, and in every shape through which a divine influence may
seem to come to a poet. No one would deserve this name of poetand
who deserves it more than Dante?if real sights and sounds never im
pressed him; and he would hardly deserve it either, if they impressed
him only physically, and for what they are in themselves. His sensibility
creates his ideal.

If to deny the existence of an historical Beatrice seems violent and
gratuitous, it would be a much worse misunderstanding not to perceive
that Beatrice is also a symbol. On one occasion, as we read in the Vita
Nuova, Dante found himself, in a church, in the presence of Beatrice.
His eyes were inevitably fixed upon her; but as he wished to conceal
his profound passion from the gossiping crowd, he chose another lady,
who happened to stand in the direct line of vision between him and
Beatrice, and pretended to be gazing at her, in reality looking beyond
her to Beatrice. This intervening lady, la donna gentile, became the screen
to his true love. But his attentions to her were so assiduous that

they were misinterpreted. Beatrice herself observed them, and think
ing he was going too far and not with an honourable purpose, showed
her displeasure by refusing to greet him as he passed. This sounds real
and earthly enough: but what is our surprise when we read expressly,
in the Convito, that the donna gentile, the screen to Dante's true love, is
philosophy. If the donna gentile is philosophy, the donna gentilissima,
Beatrice, must be something of the same sort, only nobler. She must
be theology, and theology Beatrice undoubtedly is. Her very name is
played upon, if not selected, to mean that she is what renders blessed,
what shows the path of salvation.

Now the scene in the church becomes an allegory throughout. The
young Dante, we are given to understand, was at heart a religious and



GEORGE SANTAYANA 203

devout soul, looking for the highest wisdom. But intervening between
his human reason and revealed truth (which he really was in love with,
and wished to win and to understand) he found philosophy or, as we
should say, science. To science he gave his preliminary attention; so
much so that the mysteries of theology were momentarily obscured in his
mind; and his faith, to his great sorrow, refused to salute him as he
passed. He had fallen into materialistic errors; he had interpreted the
spots on the moon as if they could be due to physical, not to Socratic,
causes; and his religious philosophy had lost its warmth, even if his
religious faith had not actually been endangered. It is certain, then,
that Beatrice, besides being a woman, was also a symbol.

But this is not the end. If Beatrice is a symbol for theology, theology
itself is not final. It, too, is an avenue, an interpretation. The eyes of
Beatrice reflect a supernal light. It is the ineffable vision of God, the
beatific vision, that alone can make us happy and be the reason and the
end of our loves and our pilgrimages.

A supreme ideal of peace and perfection which moves the lover, and
which moves the sky, is more easily named than understood. In the
last canto of the Paradiso, where Dante is attempting to describe the
beatific vision, he says many times over that our notion of this ideal
must be vague and inadequate. The value of the notion to a poet or a
philosopher does not lie in what it contains positively, but in the atti
tude which it causes him to assume towards real experience. Or per
haps it would be better to say that to have an ideal does not mean so
much to have any image in the fancy, any Utopia more or less articu
late, but rather to take a consistent moral attitude towards all the things
of this world, to judge and coordinate our interests, to establish a hier
archy of goods and evils, and to value events and persons, not by a
casual personal impression or instinct, but according to their real nature
and tendency. So understood, an ultimate ideal is no mere vision of
the philosophical dreamer, but a powerful and passionate force in the
poet and the orator. It is the voice of his love or hate, of his hope or
sorrow, idealizing, challenging, or condemning the world.

It is here that the feverish sensibility of the young Dante stood him
in good stead; it gave an unprecedented vigour and clearness to his
moral vision; it made him the classic poet of hell and of heaven. At
the same time, it helped to make him an upright judge, a terrible
accuser, of the earth. Everything and everybody in his day and genera
tion became to him, on account of his intense loyalty to his inward
vision, an instance of divine graciousness or of devilish perversity.
Doubtless this keenness of soul was not wholly due to the gift of loving,
or to the discipline of love; it was due in part also to pride, to resent
ment, to theoretical prejudices. But figures like that of Francesca di
Rimini and Manfred, and the light and rapture vibrating through the

whole Paradiso, could hardly have been evoked by a merely irritated
genius. The background and the starting-point of everything in Dante
is the intelletto d'amore, the genius of love.

J. W. Allen

In his preface to the Discorsi Machiavelli announced that he had
resolved to start upon a road hitherto untravelled by anyone. What
was it that he thought of himself as doing for the first time? We hold
antiquity, he says, in great reverence; we study the law and the medicine
of the ancients and their works of art; and yet no one goes to them for
instruction in the arts of government and war. This is not due so much
to our wretched education or to our apathy about things political, as
to our failure to understand what we read in history and to see its
practical value. Not Athens but Rome was, to Machiavelli, the emi
nently successful State of antiquity. The experience of the Romans
could not but be rich in suggestion, alike as to the causes of success and
of failure. We must study Roman history and see what profit can be
made of it for our own use. So he called his book Discourses upon Livy.
Actually there is not very much of Livy in it, and it seems clear that it
was from Italy and not from Livy or Polybius, Plutarch or Cicero,
Aristotle or Xenophon, that Machiavelli derived his main conceptions
and conclusions.

But his own explanation of his image was inadequate. The road he
was taking was, at least for the world outside Italy, even stranger than
he seems to have thought it. He insisted upon the need of studying
history because, for him, the experience of himself and of others, past
or present, was the only guide. He was proposing to concern himself
only with things as they actually are. He was not troubled by any
doubts as to what that may mean. Man is the very stuff of politics and
man's nature may be judged of by his conduct. In thinking of the
State he would think only of actual States, past or present. For a
thousand years and more men had been thinking of politics theologi
cally and juristically. Machiavelli will do neither. "He takes the data
of his own experience and checks the conclusions which he learns from

them by reference to certain canons derived from a study of history."
That, in fact, is all he does. From knowledge of man as he is and always
has been, from knowledge of the constitution of States as they are and
have been, of their modes of action and good or evil fortunes, one can
draw conclusions, valid and positive, as to the causes of political suc
cess and failure, as to the greatness and decline of States, as to the most
efficient form of government, as to what makes for stability and what
for disorder and ruin. What we need is positive knowledge of these
things and this can only be arrived at by looking at things as they are,
without fear or preconceptions. This is the only road to whatever we
desire to attain. This is the new road of Machiavelli; and certainly it
had not been trodden for a long time, except by Italians. In Italy it
did not seem strange. Machiavelli's "realistic" mode of thought was
only an extreme illustration of a tendency visible in Italian thought
since the days of the last Hohenstaufen Emperor.

Machiavelli was not a systematic thinker. He was a man of extremely
acute perceptions and capable of subtle and searching analysis of the
concrete. Failure to co-ordinate his observations is conspicuous
throughout the Discorsi and the Principe and shows itself in the con
fusion of their structure. He seems to have paid little or no attention
to the implications of what he said. Consequently, in spite of his
lucidity of statement, he falls easily into inconsistency. The elusive
quality of his writing, which accounts for a good deal of the disagree
ment about him, arises, I think, from the fact that, in spite of the
sharpness of his vision of the actual, his thought was at bottom confused.

Fundamental in his thought would seem to be his notion of the origin
and purport of the sense of good and evil in action and his conception
of the quality of man's will. The two are intimately connected, in the
sense that the latter is unintelligible till the former is understood. At
some early stage of human history, he informs us, men, considering
that the injuries they saw done to others might be done to themselves,
protected themselves by the establishment of laws, with penalties for
their infringement, and hence arose the recognition of justice. From
this establishment of government and legal justice "was born the knowl
edge of what things are good and honourable in distinction to those
that are evil and shameful." Generalized notions of right and wrong,
in fact, developed from the effort to repress forms of activity, recognized
as dangerous to himself by every individual. In course of time, it is
true, men came to think of certain kinds of action as good or evil ab
solutely. But this, it is implied, is a delusion, due either to confusion
of mind or to religious superstition. There is no absolute good. Good
ness is simply that which subserves, on the average or in the long run,
the interests of the mass of individuals. The terms good and evil have
no transcendental reference; they refer to the community, considered
as an association of individuals, and to nothing else. At bottom, ap-



J. W. ALLEN 207

parently, they refer only to the universal desire for security. Such a
view involves, of course, an absolute denial of the validity of the con
ception of natural law. For Machiavelli there was no lex aeterna and
therefore no lex naturalis. He never even thought it worth while to refer
to that conception. There was nothing new, it must be remarked, in
his way of putting the matter. It was at least as old as the Defensor Pads.
Yet Machiavelli himself does not seem to have had a clear grasp of the
implications of his own doctrine or even always to remember what he
had said. From this primary assertion of his, his view of morals in
politics can be derived quite simply. But that he himself understood it
so, is by no means clear. As I hope to show, in discussing his political
ethics, his language is not wholly consistent with that interpretation of
his meaning.

If we take Machiavelli to mean that "goodness" in action signifies
simply a tendency to promote the general welfare of the community,
then we can give definite meaning to his oft-repeated assertion that
men are radically bad. It is proved, he says, to demonstration, and all
history confirms it, that in ordering a State, this must always be as
sumed. Men will always show themselves wicked unless they are com
pelled to goodness. The ligament of obligation is a thing which, men
being the poor creatures they are, is broken upon every occasion for
their own personal profit. He means, apparently, that every man is
always ready to act in a manner detrimental to the community if he
sees any advantage to himself from doing so. Good is that which, in
my own interest, I wish my neighbour to do; but my neighbour and I,
in our own interest, are always ready to do evil. It would be difficult
to give any other meaning than this to Machiavelli's declaration that
all men are wicked. Man's will must be conceived as at bottom, anti
social and anarchical: and it is this fact that constitutes the central

problem of politics and the difficulty of actual government.
Yet it cannot be said that Machiavelli held this view without quali

fications; which, indeed, he himself supplies. Evidently he did not
think that man's will was wholly anarchical. Man, he thought, cares
for nothing but himself; he is a rascally, mean, greedy, sensual creature,
more ready to forgive the murder of his father than the seizure of his
property: gratitude for him is but the hope of benefits to come and what
he calls his love is but love of himself. But the selfish will is a will to
order and security and all men, therefore, may see the general interest
as their own. Man wills government and the State for his own profit
and protection. He is, furthermore, a timid creature and a creature of
habit. He dislikes what he is not used to and seeks the lines of least
resistance. He tends to follow well-beaten tracks. It is a fact of great
importance, practically, that it is generally easier and safer to conform
than to rebel.

Too much stress has sometimes been laid upon Machiavelli's



208 MODERN COMMENTARY ON MACHIAVELLI

insistence on the predominance of the purely selfish will in man. He
knew, even, that there were men, though certainly few, capable of
labouring for the common benefit without regard to their personal
interests. He even claimed to be one of them himself. But what is, in
this connection, of the greatest importance, is the fact that man's
capacity for developing public spirit to a point at which mere personal
interests are wholly subordinated, is implied everywhere in the Discorsi.
It was on just such a development that, in Machiavelli's view, the
stability and the strength of the State depended. It is his own fault
that he has been misread. So convinced was he that the ferocious

egotism and egregious lack of public spirit prevalent in his Italy, was
the main general cause of the land's weakness and disorder, that he was
led to lay disproportionate stress on the selfishness of man. None the
less is it true that he actually measures the strength of a State mainly
by the amount of public spirit developed within it. It was, he thought,
just such a development that had constituted the strength and ac
counted for the success of the great Roman Republic. There is, as
usual in the Discorsi, a failure to state the matter fully; but there is, I
think, no real inconsistency. Public spirit may be developed in a com
munity and so long as it lasts, and in the measure of it, a State is likely
to be strong and flourishing. On the other hand, he insists that it is
unlikely to last long. Everything tends to corruption: nothing lasts
except the radical selfishness of man.

That was in the beginning and shall be as long as man lasts. It is a
supposition of the greatest importance in Machiavelli's thought that
the quality of man's will never changes. It remains constant through
all time; it is, in fact, unalterable. It is true, Machiavelli admits, that
in different parts of the world, the character of men to some extent
differs. But he adds that men of the same region retain through all
ages almost the same character. It is mainly upon this supposition that
he bases his opinion of the practical value of history in teaching by
examples. Owing to the constant character of humanity man's history
tends constantly to repeat itself, with mere circumstantial differences.

The judicious are wont to say that he who would foresee what is to
happen should look to what has happened: for all that is has its counter
part in time past. This is so because all happenings are brought about by
the will of man, whose desires and dispositions remaining in all ages the
same, it follows that like results are produced continually.
Not only does human history tend to repeat itself but all States tend

to move as it were on a circular track. The suggestion of this cycle
would seem to have come from Polybius, but to Machiavelli it appeared
that it must actually be a fact. He conceived it as resulting from the
unchanging nature of man and from the special quality of his will
acting under changing conditions. Action and reaction alternate and



HERBERT BUTTERFIELD 209

out of prosperity comes decay and out of dissolution rebirth. Every
human institution, like every individual, has inherent defects which
must eventually destroy it. But new growth follows. States normally
commence as monarchies; but monarchy becomes tyrannical and is
overthrown by a combination of magnates, who form an oligarchy.
All goes well so long as the oligarchs are animated by public spirit. But
degeneration follows inevitably. The oligarchs in their turn are over
thrown and a popular government is established. Then liberty passes
into license and so into anarchy; and the result of anarchy is a reversion
to monarchy and the dreary round recommences. Machiavelli points
out that the cycle is only rarely actually completed. At one of its
moments of greatest weakness the State will probably be destroyed or
conquered by aliens. Assuming this not to happen, it might hopelessly
continue to infinity to turn on its circular course. In any case, men
remaining always the same poor creatures, no real progress is possible.

The finally inevitable ruin that awaits all States seems to be con
ceived by Machiavelli as partly the result of another peculiarity of
human nature. The appetite of man is for ever insatiable. By nature
he desires all things, but fate allows him little. Man is eternally de
sirous and eternally unsatisfied, raging at the present, extolling the
past, hoping in the future. No human community, no human govern
ment, any more than any single human being, is ever content with its
position. Hence arises a constant effort after aggrandisement and
domination which leads, sooner or later, to ruin. But this ruinous
effort is unavoidable. It results partly from man's everlasting dis
content and partly from the fact that conflict and war are necessary
to the health of the body politic. War and fear are what give the State
such vital unity as it has and counteract the anarchic tendency which
is rooted in the nature of man's will. Peace is relaxing and disruptive:
'Damn braces, bless relaxes.' Under these circumstances, equilibrium
is impossible, all human affairs being in perpetual motion and never
remaining for an instant as they were. The movement of the State
must needs be upward or downward. Hence, though the better its
laws and the more intelligent its ruler, the more stable will be the
State, there is yet no possible escape from ultimate ruin.

Herbert Butterfield

The thought of the Renaissance reaches at certain points an extra
ordinary emancipation from religious authority and medieval pre
possessions; but it has curious features which seem to savour now of the

millan Company, 1960), pp. 3746. Reprinted with permission of the publishers.



210 MODERN COMMENTARY ON MACHIAVELLI

occult and now of the archaic, and even when it is irreligious we must
not be too ready to call it modern. To free oneself from the tyranny
of the past or from the dominion of the written and spoken word is
never easy. Even today it requires a great exertion, a genuine effort
of will, if not always actual originality of mind. And the men of the
Renaissance we must remember, the humanists in particular, did not
wish to be so emancipated. To consult the classics on all matters, to
imitate the ancient world, was indeed for them the great adventure
the source and secret of that intellectual exhilaration which was the

glory of the Italy of this time. The Protestants, who pushed their
reverence for the ancient Scriptures to that extreme which came to be
described as Bibliolatry; the followers of Aristotle who, for over a
century after this, resisted novel theories concerning the physical
structure of the universe; the medical students who now despised
medieval science and turned the Arabians into a by-word, because
they had found a more direct route to ancient Greece; the humanists
who so deprecated the use of the vernacular that they checked the
brilliant course of Italian literature and made imitative Latin verses
the fashion, and who attempted, by copying Cicero, to turn Latin into
a dead languagethe Latin which for centuries had been rough and
alive, a handy means of international communication for scholarsall
these are only extreme examples of what was in fact a general adoration
of antiquity.

In their devotion to the ancient culture the men of the Renaissance
were most like their medieval predecessors. Perhaps it is true to say
that their subservience to the classics was even more complete. We
must note that the idea of a progressive development taking place in the
course of centuriesthe world moving forward to an unimagined



future, to wider horizons and opening vistasis a modern one. The
idea of history as an ascending process was not part of the equipment
of a Renaissance mind. In any case such a view of history could not
congenially combine with current assumptions concerning the tendency
of all composite bodies to disintegrate. The self-conscious development
of the sciences in the seventeenth century; the rising importance of a
knowledge that grows by sheer accumulation and deepens as one man
takes up the researches of his predecessors; the technical progress that
comes to be achieved in finance and industry and organization; the
cumulative results of inventions, discoveries, better communications,
speedier interchange of thoughtthese are the factors that have helped
men to believe in a future big with the promise of better things. It
was not until the seventeenth century that the world finally faced the
problem of the Ancients versus the Moderns. And perhaps we owe the
currency of the idea of progress chiefly to the grand hopefulness and
complacency of the French 'philosophic' movement. We to-day can



HERBERT BLJTTERFIELD 211

see the results of a portentous speeding-up of those processes which
cause mutation in society. Perhaps life and the world, and the general
appearance of the country-side, change more quickly now in one
generation than at one time they changed in the course of many cen
turies. It is more easy now than in the more static world of the six
teenth century to believe that apart from the ups and downs of cities
and states, apart from variations in mere clothing and custom, there
is process in history, something more than cycle and succession, some
thing more than Rome replacing Greece. Machiavelli, like his con
temporaries, naturally assumed that apart from superficial variations
of an external character, the world throughout the ages remains sub
stantially the same. In the Preface to Book II of the Discourses he writes:

And when I meditate upon the workings of these matters, I come to
the conclusion that the world always remains in very much the same con
dition. The good and the bad balance one another, but each varies from
region to region, as anybody can see who pays attention to the kingdoms
of antiquity; for though these might have differed in their customs, the
world as a whole continued its course in much the same way. The only
difference was that, whereas at one time this virtue was assembled in
Assyria, it passed to Media, then to Persia, and then to Italy and Rome.
And if since the Roman Empire there has been no enduring empire, and
no place in which all the virtue was assembled at one time, that virtue is
nevertheless scattered about amongst the many nations [not including
the Italy of the Renaissance, we may note] in which life is meritoriously
carried on.

Further than this, having no principle of progress, these men possessed
and were bound to possess, the converse conception which regards
history as normally a process of decline. According to the current belief,
it was in the nature of compound bodies to disintegrate; and human
societies and institutions were compound bodies in this sense. It is
apparent in the work of Machiavelliin the early part of the Dis
courses, for exampleand in the thought of the age, that the ascent of
states, the rise to prosperity and virtue, was regarded as something of a
miracle, a wonderful over-riding of the normal working of things in
nature; on the other hand decline was in the ordinary processes of time,
only to be checked by unsleeping vigilance and extraordinary en
deavour. A great lawgiver, a mighty act of volition, a stroke of fine
fortune, might bring a state to a condition of greatness and power; by
a grand interventiona cataclysmic eventa decadent people might
be restored to a condition of soundness and of public morality; but a
degenerate people, ordinarily speaking, could not recover themselves
again (any more than water could rise above its own level), as Machia
velli pointed out; and, even when greatness had been achieved, it was
held that corruption soon set in, by an automatic process, if vigilance



212 MODERN COMMENTARY ON MACHIAVELLI

was relaxed for a moment and extraordinary energy was not continu
ously displayed.

So the men of the Renaissance believed in a closed culture, and did
not imagine that civilization could be indefinitely expandingcon
tinually producing new things. The boundaries of that culture had
been reached in ancient Greece and Rome, and men could only revolve
ancient things anew, could only hope to travel over the same ground
and win the old truths back again, could only dream of equalling
perhaps the achievements and the prowess of the ancient days. More
strongly than the generations that preceded them they believed that
since classical times the whole world had been wandering in darkness;
and though when they said that wisdom lay in "antiquity," it might
seem that they had in mind the prudence and the knowledge that come
with the multitude of years, it did not occur to them to see that the
world of Greece and Rome was on this view younger than theirs
that, as the centuries advance, mankind in fact gets older and wiser.
It was a generation after the death of Machiavelli that Giordano Bruno
in La Cena de le Ceneri thought it worth while to expose the current
fallacy in regard to this matter:

If you properly understood what you were saying you would see that
from your principle there follows a conclusion which is exactly the con
trary to the one you have in mind: I mean that it is we who are older and
who have a greater multitude of years than our predecessors; at any rate
as regards certain topics, like the one with which we are dealing at the
moment [the Copernican theory]. The judgement of Eudoxus who lived
shortly after the rebirth of astronomy (if the renaissance did not actually
take place through him) could not be so mature as that of Callippus, who
lived thirty years after the death of Alexander the Great; and who, as
year succeeded year, could add observation to observation. Hipparchus
for the same reason must have known more than Callippus. . . . More
has been seen by Copernicus, almost in our day.

It is not too much to say that the thinkers of the Renaissance were
undoubtedly right in the main general conclusion that they drew from
their theory of history. From their point of view the classical world
was the peak of civilization; and devotion to it had not yet become
mere bondage for the scientific mind. Also, we may add that in many
of their aspects the classics became, and long remained, one of the
important constituents of the modern world. In any case English
students should glance sympathetically even upon the prejudices of
the Renaissance on the subject of the historical process; for these may
be said to have become blended with our own fortunes and embedded
in our political consciousness. When the Whigs emerged victorious
in England towards the close of the seventeenth century, they did not
stand out as the apostles of modernity and progress. Renaissance



HERBERT BUTTERFIELD 213

views on the processes of history were part of the make-up of their
minds. The theory of decline which we are examining at the moment
was part of the structure of their interpretation of history. Always the
Golden Age would seem to have been behind them, if even occasionally
one could only impute it to a dim and unspecified past. Always it was
said that the Glorious Revolution "restored our constitution to its

primitive vigour" and recovered the liberty that our ancestors had
enjoyed. The Revolution indeed brought our government "back to its
first principles" and reasserted the Tightness of an ancient law. Further
more, the Whigs who believed that liberty ever tends to decline unless
men are constantly vigilant, that, if liberty is to be preserved in a new
age, fresh laws and institutions must be devised to guard it against
unforeseen dangers, that no laws can preserve liberty if the people
themselves have become corrupted, saw the force of these maxims with
special vividness because they were near to a view of history that
stressed the tendency to decline. Into English Whiggism, in fact, passed
the most benevolent of the maxims of Machiavelli himself; who had
discussed the decay of liberty, the policies that would serve to arrest
decline, and the whole problem of corruption in the state.

These ideas upon the classical world and the historical process are
the background against which we must see the work of Machiavelli;
and in the light of them it becomes the more remarkable that this man
should have reproached his contemporaries for their indifference to
the ancient world. In pursuing the cult of antiquity into the realm of
statecraft and urging that imitation should be definite and detailed,
he outstripped his generation; here he himself claimed to be unique
and his contemporaries seem to have regarded him as such; and this
we have seen was the very thing which he specified as the contribution
that he had to make. Whereas the philosopher and scientist looked to
ancient Greece, he, as a political teacher, put all his faith in republican
Rome. The principal exposition of his statecraft is a commentary on
Livy. His treatise on the Art of War is an essay on the imitation of the
Romans. Perhaps the greatest effect of the isolated reading of The
Prince, and the special notoriety that this book has enjoyed in so many
generations, has been an underestimation of the strength of his devotion
and the greatness of his debt to antiquity. For in The Prince his obliga
tions to classical history and ancient writers are for the most part con
cealed; and the statecraftthough it is always the same statecraft
has been given a more topical bearing than in the other treatises. A
generation ago a German writer, Ellinger, however, traced some of the
classical borrowings in The Prince and many such borrowings are
noted in Burd's edition. It will be seen below that Machiavelli's in
debtedness to the Romans is not any less remarkable in this book than
in the rest of his political writings.



214 MODERN COMMENTARY ON MACHIAVELLI

In general Machiavelli's statements on the imitation of the Romans
are remarkably specific, and unmistakable in their insistence:

From all these considerations the true method appears to be the one
which the Romans used, and it is all the more remarkable in that it has
never been adopted by any other people before or since. ... We might
add by way of conclusion that many other rules which the Romans ob
served in conducting their affairs both at home and abroad are not only
not imitated in these days but are treated with definite lack of considera
tion; some of them being looked upon as mere fables, others as impossible
and others again as not appropriate or of no utility; and to this ignorant
attitude we owe the fact that our country of late has been the prey of
every invader who cared to come.

Disc. II 4.

In the sixth chapter of the first book of the Discourses, he shows that
in founding a state it is better to follow the Romans and establish the
state for purposes of aggrandizement and not merely for long duration.
It had already been suggested in the preceding chapter that "if the
state be designed to extend its dominion . . . the conduct of the Romans
must be imitated in every particular."

Machiavelli's argument for the adoption of his maxims is the asser
tion that by following them the Romans achieved their success and
renown. The question as to which form of government he preferred
is an easy one to answer both from his own statements and by inference
from the principles he puts forward. He did not admire ancient Rome
because the Romans had a republic; he admired republican govern
ment because it was the form under which ancient Rome had achieved

unexampled greatness and power. He admired Switzerland, and
feared her designs on Italy, and was once reproved for suggesting that
she would "do what the ancient Romans had done"; and this was
because from ancient Rome he had gained a high opinion of what he
called "armed republics" and considered Switzerland to stand in this
class. And there is no contradiction when Machiavelli tells us in one

place that a mixed form of governmenta combination of monarchy,
aristocracy, and democracyis best; for he had learned from ancient
writers to consider republican Rome in this very light, stressing the
combination of consuls, senate, and plebs. One might have inferred
from Machiavelli's beliefs on the subject of history and fortune that if
a race like the Romans had existed as an example of happy achieve
ment and public well-being, he would have opposed the view which
tended to ascribe this success to good fortune and combinations of
circumstances; he would have preferred to attribute it to virtue and
good policy which he would enjoin future generations to copy. This
is what actually happens in the Discourses though Machiavelli has to
differ from both Plutarch and Livy on the point.



HERBERT BUTTERFIELD 215

His imitation of the ancients implied the acceptance of their precepts
as well as their practice, and in particular the acceptance of many of
the maxims or historical comments of ancient writers. Those who like
to think that he merely pretended to possess the authority of ancient
examples, which he did not use save as cover for policies of his own,
cannot deny that he followed ancient precepts even in numerous cases
where he did not pretend to be doing so at all. The Prince itself, which
has such close relations with Machiavelli's period of active political
service, contains a remarkable assortment of quotations, imitations,
paraphrases, or variations of the teaching of antiquity. The very idea
of the "new prince" as the founder of a new state and a new condition
of things is based upon classical writers; and the application of this
idea to the special purpose of the amelioration of the condition of
Italy has been ascribed to the influence of Xenophon's Hiero. This
book, which Machiavelli had certainly read, and which he called by
the title De Tyrannide dealt with the situation and problems of a new
prince who had gained power in a state that had hitherto been free;
and it influenced The Prince in a number of details if not in the general
lines of the theme. The dedication to The Prince opens with a passage
which we are told is modelled upon Isocrates, and the final chapter
exhorting the new prince to deliver Italy from the barbarians has
resemblances to Isocrates' exhortation to Philip, though the direct
connection has in this later case been disputed. The dictum that the
prince must imitate the fox and the lion; the recurring suggestion that
conquests can be maintained if only the family of the dispossessed ruler
is wiped out; the view that the prince can avoid hatred if he does not
usurp the property and the women of his subjects; the claim that a
prince should have no other aim or thought or preoccupation but war
all these and many others too numerous to mention have been
shown to be close reproductions of the opinions of ancient writers.

Finally the very method by which Machiavelli proposed to discover
statecraft from the examples of history, and all the principles upon
which his "lessons of history" were basedthe doctrine of imitation,
the view that human nature is constant, the idea that history runs in
cycles and that similar situations and problems recurall are a heritage
from the ancient world, a further proof of his discipleship. And I do
not think we realize how often even when Machiavelli seems to be

inductive, seems to be describing the contemporary world, he is really
only making deductions from classical theses concerning human nature



or the historical process . . . . We must not regard his statecraft in the
first place as the result of observation of the contemporary world. It

The primordial, ultimate character of this worlddevoid of great
moral and political motifs, uninfluenced by the masses, having its
being solely in the isolated virtue of scattered individuals, who left
their own imprint on material that was flabby and incoherentfinds
its true expression in The Prince. The latter is not exactly a history of
the Seigniories and Principates, if by history we mean the detailed
examination and the minute and constant assessment of specific events.
Rather does it summarize and illustrate the consequences of history,
revealing them in broad outline, stripped of all irrelevancy. Naturally,
it does not go into detailsMachiavelli is not at all concerned now with
writing historyand these must be sought elsewhere, just as we have
to look elsewhere for a precise, factual account of the course which
Italian life pursued in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Here we
have merely the fundamental principle which determines and informs
the various immediate manifestations of that lifea principle that is
at the same time a consequence.

But Machiavelli, with that powerful creative imagination of his,
manages to escape from the realm of mere diplomacy, to which Guic
ciardini, on the other hand, will confine himself exclusively. He sees
beynd the Court events of the last fifty years and, by a wonderful
intellectual effort which remained incomprehensible to his contem
poraries and caused him to be described as "extravagant to a degree in
his opinions and a discoverer of new and unusual things," succeeds
in re-creating the possibility of a great political struggle.

Just as the expansion of the seigniorial State had not been accom
panied by a corresponding increase of political virtue, so he too deals
only in superficialities; but at least that is something. The grandiose
ideal which the Visconti had sought to realizethe establishment of a
unitarian State in the Po valleyrecurs in Machiavelli as an intellec
tual concept. Indeed, its realization becomes a certainty; it is seen as
the object of a faith that reveals all the passion in the writer's soulfor
his discretion and composure are not always sufficient for him to con-

ceal the true nature of his feelings. Not for him the cut-and-thrust of
diplomacy, the ebb and flow of negotiations in which the point of
equilibrium is sought through the shrewd assessment of possibilities,
but rather the clear, positive affirmation of a system which, while
availing itself to the maximum degree of the arts of government, human
speculation, and back-room intrigue, aims not at a balance of forces
but at its own undisputed supremacy. Such are Machiavelli's guiding
principles; and in this way he abandons the limited aims of the Italic
confederation and of Lorenzo de' Medici and goes back to Gian Gale
azzo Visconti and Ladislao of Naples.

Accordingly, he will reject neutrality as being the most pernicious
of doctrines, and will refer to the Italian political equilibrium of former
years as a mistake that should be rectified and consigned to oblivion.

Such is the origin of the treatise De Principatibus, in which political
strife, in its most blatant connotation of a struggle for victory and
power, is reduced to a schematic form; but experience brings with it a
new vigour, which, accepting the basic principle, seeks to carry it out
in the surest way possible, and so exposes the uncertainties and mistakes
of the past.

There could be no doubt as to the correct ways of putting the idea
into practice. In the complete absence of any collective force by which
the new edifice could be supported, and assuming, as Machiavelli did,
that the virtue of the Prince was to be the supreme controlling factor
of life, it was essential to follow the paths already trodden by man,
through whom the revival must be brought about. Hence the minute,
cold, incisive analysis, centring round the figure of the presumed ruler;
hence, too, the careful examination of the position in which the latter
would find himself in relation to his subjects and to foreigners. The
details necessarily preserve that personal quality which characterizes
the points of departure and arrival.

And just as for two hundred years of her history Italy had been
dominated by the figures of the great Seigneurs, who were unsustained
by the power of tradition or of any myth, so in the treatise the thing
that serves to illuminate the general background of events, even if the
latter are not determined solely by an individual, is the character of
the Prince, all sinew and thought, cold and impenetrable, like one of
those fine suits of armour made of delicately-wrought steel in which
warriors used to encase themselves before a battle: the new Prince,
sustained not by the memory of his ancestors, not by the recollection
of long years of suffering shared with his people, but solely by his own
wit and strength of will, his warlike prowess and diplomatic wisdom.
Men are more "beholden" to virtuous actions than to "ancient blood."

The people, who bring the first book of the Discorsi to life and con
dition its thought, so much so that Machiavelli justly regards the



218 MODERN COMMENTARY ON MACHIAVELLI

struggle between patricians and plebs as the source of Rome's greatness,
are absent from The Prince. They do not even appear in the distance
as a social and political entity. We have the Prince's subjects, isolated
beings, fragments, as it were, of a vast whole which no longer exists,
opposed to the sovereign, but as man to man. Hence the necessity for
the Prince to humour them, not to dishonour them or violate their
property, to keep their friendship. But where is there any reference to
the strength that derives from collective action? When the author seems
at first sight to be returning to the theme of the organizing capacity of
the masses we find ourselves confronted not with the people but with a
confused rabble, not with a party, rich in native energy, abounding in
enterprises of its own, seeking to fulfil clearly-defined political aspira
tions and therefore capable of facing the disputes and the free clashes
of opinion on which the fortunes of the Republic depend, but with a
mob that "does not wish to be oppressed" and judges "a thing by its
result." Compare Chapter 9 of The Prince with the passage in Chapter 4
of the first book of the Discorsi in which Machiavelli speaks of the
struggle between patricians and plebs in Rome, or with Chapter 6.
These last-named chapters breathe a living force, ever-present and
self-conscious, a force that creates its forms of life and overcomes indi
vidual passions by welding them into the compact unity of a common
passion, a force that can also err "through excessive love" of its liberty
but in a Republic that is not corrupt its very error is a source of great
good "and enables it (the Republic) to lead a free life." In Chapter 9
of The Prince, on the other hand, we have an amorphous, scattered and
truly anonymous mob, in which nothing has any significance except
the feelings of individual persons, who are incapable of perceiving the
collective mind that transcends their own, or of aspiring to the grandeur
of political resolution, even if the latter be expressed in the communal
strife of parties. We have once more "a brute beast, which . . . not
being accustomed to feeding itself, nor knowing the hiding-places in
which it might take refuge, becomes the prey of the first man who tries
to recapture it."

Nor is the nobility any less irresolute and aimless. It is reduced, in
short, to engaging in a battle of wits with princes and people, to hatch
ing plots designed to further only immediate interests of limited scope,
beyond which there is now nothing. These Italian Grandi lack even
the pridea pride not devoid of a certain heroic qualitywhich
united the French feudatories against the Monarchy; the latter at any
rate had a pride of casteas Machiavelli noted. Hatreds and passions
are aroused by personal, trivial and therefore fleeting dissensions. The
Grandi cannot mould their desire to dominate the people into a clear
line of conduct, and in the end they bow the knee to the Prince, after
which fresh disorders quickly supervene.



FEDERICO CHABOD 219

Finally, the Prince must gain the friendship of the people, so that he
may keep them "alive"; but the mob must derive this "life" from a
virtue that is outside itself, from a power that stands above it. For
what life remains in those "guilds" or "tribes", the ancient and glorious
corporations of arts and arms, potent symbol of the creative capacity
of the Communal bourgeoisie? The Prince must take these people into
account, so that he may sometimes talk to them and give examples of
humanity and magnificence, as if he were a juggler who has to win the
favour of an indifferent public.

The emotional invocation at the end itself brings out, once and for
all, this lack of spiritual energy: "Here is great virtue among individual
members of the community"; but meanwhile these are not capable of
any action unless the genius of a single condottiere is forthcoming to
arouse them; and they wait "open-mouthed" for the "manna in the
desert".

Machiavelli, then, is impelled to keep his eyes fixed on the Man
alone; and while he propounds some of the general principles that have
occurred to him as a result of his long meditationabove all that of the
necessity of a State militia, which he regards as fundamentalhe is
faced with the task of discovering the specific human laws on which
the difficult art of government will henceforth be based. In this way
the treatise on Principates takes the form of a relentless analysis, a
kaleidoscope of humanity.

Not that we do not discern even in this the continual expression of a
creative imagination that is induced to reconstruct analytical detail
through its own power of synthesis. Moreover, the inexorable necessity
of reducing an impression that is beautifully complete in itself to the

%

form of a rigid principle is clearly revealed. Just as Machiavelli trans
forms the historical fact into a theoretical precept, so he remoulds the
closely-observed detail into the maxim of unvarying significance, with
the result that the contrast with the "discretion" of Francesco Guic
ciardini becomes newly apparent; but in the event the axiom, possessing
a clearly-defined factual foundation, has a vitality that often disguises
its general character, making it as immediate as a psychological
observation.
Thus the argument is coloured by human impressions, rapid, clear

and complete. Machiavelli, who has spent many years in the service
of the Florentine Republic, has met a great number of men, especially
the kind of men who hold the tangled threads of the political skein in
their hands. Perhaps he is not by nature very diplomatic, not inured
to subtle disputations in which care is always taken to keep the language
within the limits of a formality that never yields place to the Horatian
fides perlucidior vitro. Perhaps he lacks the temper of a merchant, having
acquired through long practice the habit of remaining impassive and



220 MODERN COMMENTARY ON MACHIAVELLI

indifferent, with an indifference that terrifies those who have to face it.
Perhaps he does not always succeed in restraining the vehemence of his
feelings with that calm, lordly mastery which is characteristic of Guic
ciardini. Yet the sometimes painful experience of many years has
removed his rough edges, made him civilized, enabling him to perform
the most difficult manoeuvres with ease and accustoming him to assume
that cold inscrutability which is essential to those who wish to gamble
at Court with the lives and destinies of nations. Sometimes, it is true,
he forgets what he has learned, and has sudden outbursts of enthusiasm
and bitterness which a true diplomat would never permit himself; and
indeed his natural confidence re-appears in The Prince alongside the
acquired manner, moulding the calm and severe analysis into periods
that are often animated, vivacious and unexpected. But at any rate the
prolonged constraint of public life, combined with the natural per
spicacity of his judgment, have taught him to measure carefully the
acts and words of those who sit in government over cities and to cal
culate exactly the effect of the subtle interweaving of the sometimes
discordant thoughts and feelings from which the event proceeds
though the process is invisible to the mob.

And so, even when the axioms seem general to a degree, we discern
the concrete, precise foundation, unwavering in its detail. The very
turn of the clear, laconic phrase, whose every accent is endowed with
colour and form, reveals the perfection of the psychological inquiry,
which permeates the canvas on which the new State is gradually taking
shape.

Moreover, Niccol does not have much trouble in describing the
characters and sketching in the lines of the different figures. It is
enough for him to fix his gaze on the various Italian princes, on that
crowd of men who had in many cases risen from the humblest circum
stances to prosperity, as was possible in those days, by rapid jumps
men who had made themselves the wonder of their contemporaries
and had appeared before Machiavelli himself in the privacy of a closed
room, like Valentino, or in the crowded halls of another Seigneur, like
the princes and ambassadors at the Court of Maximilian. Such frag
ments of human life present themselves almost automatically, ready to
be re-assembled into an organic whole, to one who recalls, for example,
men like Sigismondo Malatesta or Federigo da Montefeltro, both
"fox" and "lion" at once. Failing all else there is the portrait of Piero
della Francesca; the living image of the Prince with his broad face,
prominent canine jaw, and glassy, impassive stare. As for his mind,
Machiavelli can reconstruct it with certainty merely by contemplating
the image as it appears roughly outlined against the luminous back
ground.

He finds Valentino truly perfectpartly because in the character
of this son of a Pope, "le plus desloyal filz de Prestre qui fut onques",



FRIEDRICH MEINECKE 221

perfect poise was combined with a prodigious blending of cold calcula
tion and passion, so that he was able to indulge his passion for sensual
pleasures without prejudice to his wise imperialistic plan; but most of all
because Caesar Borgia tried to create a strong unitarian State, pursuing
that goal to which, in the solitude of his villa, the writer's thoughts
were likewise directed. Final ruin can barely dim the brightness of the
vast stage upon which moved the figure of the condottiere sans peur et sans
remords. Machiavelli explains his ruin as a caprice of fortune"for
tune" being an obscure, indeterminate idea to which he never suc
ceeded in giving clear expression in a bold spiritual affirmation, some
times regarding it as the force and logic of history, but more often as a
mysterious, transcendent grouping of events, whose incoherence is
unintelligible to the human mind. Fortune has "reproved Valentino";
and the writer is not concerned to examine the fundamental justice
of her condemnation.

Thus the picture remains serenely sculptural. It is dominated from
afar by the mocking figure of the Borgia, inscrutable in his smile as in
his meaning look, with his great black beard that climbs up his pale
cheeks and gives his face a sombre setting, even as his mind is circum
scribed by his fixed imperial resolve, which is dimly reflected in his
every gesture.

He dominates the picture, yet only from a distance; for The Prince
is no more a glorification of Caesar Borgia than of all those other
Seigneurs who come upon the scenesome returning again and again,
so that we glimpse the hard, angular features of Francesco Sforza and
Ferdinand of Aragn. But since the State can only be founded upon a
specific personagefor it has to be conditioned first and foremost by
the virtue of an individual, and the inert material awaits the imprint
of an "excessive" excellenceit is natural that the analysis should
centre round a figure who will confer on the scattered fragments, which
are endowed both with reason and with emotion, a sense of community;
and naturally the dominating figure is the son of Alexander VI, who
has so often been reviled by the Republicans of Florence.

Friedrich Meinecke

This kind of naturalism can easily lead to a harmless and unreflecting
multiplicity in the question of human values. But (in spite of the
offering which he gladly brought to the altar of Venus) Machiavelli
concentrated all his real and supreme values in what he called virt.

222 MODERN COMMENTARY ON MACHIAVELLI

This concept is exceedingly rich in meaning, and although it was taken
over from the tradition of antiquity and humanism, it had been felt
and elaborated in a quiet individual manner; ethical qualities were
certainly embraced in it, but it was fundamentally intended to portray
something dynamic, which Nature had implanted in Manheroism
and the strength for great political and warlike achievements, and first
and foremost, perhaps, strength for the founding and preservation of
flourishing States, particularly republics. For in the republics, of which
Rome in its great republican period seemed to him an ideal example, he
saw the conditions most favourable for the generation of virt. It there
fore embraced the civic virtues and those of the ruling class; it embraced
a readiness to devote oneself to the common good, as well as the wisdom,
energy and ambition of the great founders and rulers of States. But the
virt which the founder and ruler of a State had to possess counted for
Machiavelli as virt of a higher order. For in his opinion this kind of
virt was able, by means of appropriate 'regulations', to distil out of the
thoroughly bad and wretched material of average specimens of hu
manity the other kind of virt in the sense of civic virtue; to a certain
extent the latter was virt of a secondary quality, and could only be
durable if it was rooted in a people whose spirit was naturally fresh
and unspoilt. This separation of virt into two types, one original and
the other derived, is of exceptional significance for a complete under
standing of the political aims of Machiavelli. For it shows that he was
a long way from believing uncritically in the natural and imperishable
virtue of a republican citizen, and that he viewed even the republic
more from above, from the standpoint of the rulers, than from under
neath, from the standpoint of broad-based democracy. He appreciated
the proverb, which was popular in his time, that in piazza your opinions
were not the same as they were in palazzo .... His republican ideal
therefore contained a strain of monarchism, in so far as he believed
that even republics could not come into existence without the help of
great individual ruling personalities and organizers. He had learnt
from Polybius the theory that the fortunes of every State are repeated
in a cycle, and that the golden age of a republic is bound to be followed
by its decline and fall. And so he saw that, in order to restore the
necessary quantum of virt which a republic had lost by sinking to such
a low point, and thus raise up the State once again, there was only one
means to be adopted; namely, that the creative virt of one individual,
of one mano regia, one podest quasi regia . . . , should take the State in
hand and revive it. Indeed he went so far as to believe that for republics
which were completely corrupt and no longer capable of regeneration,
monarchy was the only possible form of government. Thus his concept
of virt formed a close link between republican and monarchical ten
dencies, and, after the collapse of the Florentine Republic, enabled



FRIEDRICH MEINECKE 223

him without inconsistency to set his hopes on the rule of the Medicis,
and to write for them the Book of the Prince. In the same way it made
it possible for him immediately afterwards to take up again in the
Discorsi the strain of republicanism, and to weigh republic and mon
archy against one another.

Moreover his own special ethic of virta product of the joyous
worldly spirit of the Renaissancebegins now to throw light on the
relation in which he stands to the ordinary Christian, and so-called
genuine, morality; this relationship has been the cause of much dispute
and a continual subject of reproof to Machiavelli. We have already
remarked that he retained the basic Christian views on the difference
between good and evil. When he advocated evil actions, he never
denied them the epithet evil or attempted any hypocritical conceal
ment. Nor did he dare to embody direct traits of morally wicked be
haviour in his ideal of virt. In Chapter 8 of the Principe, which deals
with Agathocles, he says that to murder one's co-citizens, to betray
one's friends, to be lacking in loyalty, piety and religion, cannot deserve
the name of virt; these things can achieve mastery, but not glory.
And yet in Agathocles, who behaved in this way, he recognized at the
same time a real virt and grandezza dell'animo, i.e. great virtues of a
ruler. The ethical sphere of his virt therefore lay in juxtaposition to
the usual moral sphere like a kind of world of its own; but for him it
was the higher world, because it was the vital source of the State, of
the vivere politico, the supreme task of human creativity. And because
it was for him the higher world, so it could be permitted to trespass
and encroach on the moral world in order to achieve its aims. These
encroachments and infringements, these "sins" in the Christian sense,
never ceased to be judged by him as immoral, and did not indeed
constitute virt itselfbut they could in the last resort (as we shall
soon see more clearly) arise out of virt.

Let us first look more closely at his theory of virt, and at the striking
mixture of pessimism and idealism, of mechanistic and vitalistic ele
ments, which go to compose it. In the Discorsi. . . , he says that of their
own accord men will never do anything good, unless they are driven to
it by some "necessity". Hunger and poverty, he goes on, make men
industrious, and laws make them good. The penalties imposed on any
infringement of the laws lead on towards a recognition of justice. For
him, therefore, moral goodness and justice were produced and could
be produced by the constraining power of the State. How high his
opinion was of the State, and how little he thought of individual human
beings! But this rigid positivist causal nexus was relaxed through the
medium of virt, and by a belief in the creative powers of great men,
who, through their own virt and the wise regulations which they made,
were able to raise up the average level of humanity to a new, secondary



224 MODERN COMMENTARY ON MACHIAVELLI

form of virt. Then too it was another mechanistic and fatalistic belief
of his that, since the world always remained the same and all things
were repeated in a cycle, virt did not exist in the world in unlimited
supply, but was passed round in the world continually, and now this,
now that people was privileged to possess it. This was echoed by Hegel
three hundred years later when, in his theory about the 'dominant
peoples of world history' (who are entrusted by the World Spirit from

%

time to time with the task of directing its affairs in the world), he made
the fatalistic element part of a sublime philosophy of progress and
ascent. Machiavelli however contented himself with stating resignedly
that only in ancient times did it happen that a single nation was blessed
with a preponderance of this virt', in modern times it was divided up
amongst a number of nations. This brings out very clearly the simi
larity and the difference between the centuries. Surrounded by the
collapse of the political world in which they lived, both thinkers cast
longing eyes on the representatives of strength and efficiency in world
historyHegel with an optimistic belief in progress, the result of the
century of the Enlightenment, Machiavelli with the old belief in the
everlasting similarity of historical life, a belief which had always been
fostered by the Christian disdain for this world and which the vital
energy of the Renaissance had not been able to break down. But this
vital energy was still strong enough not to lose courage even amid the
collapse and in the face of the contempt of humanity, and strong enough
to watch out for fresh virt. For the development and creation of virt
was for Machiavelli the ideal, and completely self-evident, purpose of
the State. To raise his own nation by means of virt from the low point
to which it had sunk, and to regenerate the State, if this was still possible
(he continually wavered between doubting this and believing it), be
came his life interest. But this new political idealism was now indeed
burdened with the serious problematical element which was inherent
in the character of raison d'etat. This brings us nearer to our real task.

It was certainly impossible, once the moral and religious bond had
been severed which held together the mediaeval Christian ideal of life,
to set up immediately a new worldly system of ideals which would have
the same inner unity and compactness. For, to minds freshly released
from the restraints of the Middle Ages, so many provinces of life were
now opened up simultaneously that it was not possible at once to find a
distinctive point of view, from which the secularized world could be
grasped and comprehended once again as a harmonious unity. One
made discoveries, first in one place, then in another; one devoted one
self enthusiastically and often quite wholeheartedly to the discovery of
the moment and became so completely taken up with it, that one had
no opportunity to examine the contradictions and discrepancies between
the experiences one had newly acquired and the human values which



FRIEDRICH MEINECKE 225
%

had held up till now. Machiavelli possessed this one-sided passion for
discovery to an extraordinary degree. He threw himself on his parti
cular aim of the moment in such a way that occasionally all he himself
had previously thought and said was entirely forgotten. In a quite
undaunted, now and then almost fanatical manner, he deduced the
most extreme, and sometimes the most terrible consequences from the
truths which he had found, without ever testing their reaction on other
beliefs he held. In the course of his experimental discoveries he was
also fond of changing his standpoint, and identifying himself for the
moment with widely different interests in the political struggle, so that
for each interested party, whether it be a prince or an enemy of princes,
he could devise some powerful remedy, some medicinaforte (and wherever
possible a regola generale). His occasional recipes, then, should often
be taken as having a certain degree of relativity. And these tendencies
of his should be kept firmly in view.

The most serious discrepancy in his system of thoughta discrepancy
which he never succeeded in eliminating and which he never even
tried to eliminatelay between the newly discovered ethical sphere of
virt, and of the State animated by virt, on the one hand, and the old
sphere of religion and morality on the other. This virt of Machiavelli
was originally a natural and dynamic idea, which (not altogether
unhappily) contained a certain quality of barbarity (ferocia) ; he now
considered that it ought not to remain a mere unregulated natural
force (which would have been in accordance with the spirit of the
Renaissance) but that it ought to be raised into a virt ordinata, into a
rationally and purposively directed code of values for rulers and citi
zens. The virt ordinata naturally set a high value on religion and moral
ity, on account of the influence they exerted towards maintaining the
State. In particular, Machiavelli spoke out very forcibly on the subject
of the indispensability of religion . . .; at any rate, he was strongly in
favour of a religion which would make men courageous and proud. He
once named "religion, laws, military affairs" together in one breath,
as the three fundamental pillars of the State. But, in the process,
religion and morality fell from the status of intrinsic values, and became
nothing more than means towards the goal of a State animated by
virt. It was this that led him on to make the double-edged recom
mendation, which resounded so fearsomely down the centuries to come,
inciting statesmen to an irreligious and at the same time dishonest
scepticism: the advice that even a religion tinged with error and decep
tion ought to be supported and the wiser one was the more one would
do it ... . Whoever thought like this was, from a religious point of
view, completely adrift. What final certainty and sure foundation was
there left in life, if even an unbelieved and false religion could count as
valuable, and when moral goodness was seen as being a product of



226 MODERN COMMENTARY ON MACHIAVELLI

fear and custom? In this godless world of Nature man was left alone
with only himself and the powers Nature had given him, to carry on
the fight against all the fateful forces wielded by this same Nature.
And this was exactly what Machiavelli conceived his own situation
to be.

It is striking and forceful to observe how he strove to rise superior
to it. On the one side fortuna, on the other virtthis was how he
interpreted it. Many people today (he says in Ch. 25 of the Principe), in
the face of the various blows of Fate and unsuspected revolutions we
have experienced, are now of the opinion that all wisdom is entirely
unavailing against the action of Fate, and that we must just let it do
what it likes with us. He admits that even he himself has occasionally
felt like this when in a gloomy mood. But he considered it would be
lacking in virt to surrender to the feeling. One must rouse oneself and
build canals and dams against the torrent of Fate, and then one will be
able to keep it within bounds. Only half our actions are governed by
Fortune; the other half, or almost half, is left to us. "Where men have
not much virt, then fortuna shows its strength clearly enough. And
because it is full of change, so there are numerous changes in republics
and states. And these will always go on changing, until sooner or later
there will come a man who so loves antiquity, that he will regulate
fortuna; then it will not be able to show every twenty-four hours how
much it is capable of accomplishing" .... Fortuna has got to be beaten
and bruised like a woman one wants to possess, and boldness and
barbarity will always be more successful there than coldness. But this
boldness has got to be united with great cunning and calculation, for
each situation of fate demands a method specially suited for dealing
with it. He began to meditate very deeply on just this particular prob
lem, for it showed up very clearly both the powers and the limitations
of virt, and of humanity altogether. The individual agent cannot
escape the nature he is born with. He acts in such and such a way
because this nature requires it. Hence it arises that, according to the
disposition of Fate, this same method which his character dictates will
turn out well one day, and badly the next .... An insight of this kind
could lead back to fatalism. But the effect on him of all these doubts
and impulses was like the bending of a taut-strung bow. He let fly his
arrows with all the more force.

Enemies learn to use each other's weapons. Virt has the task of
forcing backfortuna. Fortuna is malicious, so virt must also be malicious,
when there is no other way open. This expresses quite plainly the real
spiritual origin of Machiavellismi the infamous doctrine that, in
national behaviour, even unclean methods are justified, when it is a
question of winning or of keeping the power which is necessary for the
State. It is the picture of Man, stripped of all transcendent good quali-

ties, left alone on the battlefield to face the daemonic forces of Nature,
who now feels himself possessed too of a daemonic natural strength and
returns blow for blow. In Machiavelli's opinion, virt had a perfectly
genuine right to take up any weapon, for the purpose of mastering
Fortune. One can easily see that this doctrine, which appeared so
dualistic on the outside, had really sprung from the background of a
na'ive Monism, which made all the powers of life into forces of Nature.
It now became a presupposition for the discovery which Machiavelli
had made about the essence of raison d'etat.

But in order to make this discovery, yet another theory was needed
one which he thought out and applied just as clearly and consistently
as he did the theory of the struggle between virt and fortuna. This was
the theory of necessit. Virt, fortuna and necessit are three words which
keep on sounding again and again throughout his writings with a kind
of brazen ring. /'

MONUMENTS OF WESTERN THOUGHT

Edited by Norman F. Cantor and Peter L. Klein, Brandis University

This series introduces students to works instrumental in shaping Western thought.
Each volume contains extensive selections from the writings of two major thinkers of
